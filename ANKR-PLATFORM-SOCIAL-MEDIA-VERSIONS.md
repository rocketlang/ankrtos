🎓 Announcing ANKR Learning Platform: AI-Powered Education for India

I'm excited to share that ANKR Labs is building an AI-powered learning platform in partnership with Pratham Foundation, designed to make quality education accessible to every child in India.

THE CHALLENGE:
Students struggle with thick textbooks, lack support after school hours, and have limited practice resources. Teachers spend hours creating tests instead of teaching.

THE SOLUTION:
ANKR Learning Platform combines:
✅ RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) for intelligent Q&A
✅ Local AI (free, privacy-first)
✅ Multi-modal learning (text, audio, visual)
✅ Works with existing textbooks (not generic content)
✅ 22 Indian languages
✅ Offline-first architecture

KEY FEATURES:
• Students ask questions → Get instant answers with page references
• Audio lessons (learn while commuting)
• Auto-generated quizzes (unlimited practice)
• Knowledge graphs (visual learning)
• Progress tracking & analytics
• Teacher dashboard (identify struggling students)

INNOVATION:
Inspired by Google's NotebookLM, we're adding:
• Knowledge graphs (visual concept mapping)
• Complete study packages (summary + audio + quiz + flashcards)
• Multi-source intelligence (ask across multiple textbooks)

THREE PLATFORMS:
1. ANKR EDU → K-12 students & teachers (Pratham focus)
2. ANKR RESEARCH → Professional research tools
3. ANKR OPEN → Open source, self-hosted, free forever

TIMELINE:
• Month 1-2: Pilot with 100 Pratham students
• Month 6: Production-ready (10,000 students)
• Month 12: Open source release + national scale

WHY THIS MATTERS:
Education is the great equalizer. By combining AI with Pratham's proven pedagogy and India-first design, we can transform learning outcomes for millions of children.

This is not just software. This is a movement.

CALL TO ACTION:
📚 Educators: Want to pilot this with your students?
💻 Developers: Want to contribute to open source?
🤝 Partners: Want to help scale this impact?

### **LinkedIn Post 2: Technical Deep Dive**

🧠 How We Built ANKR: RAG + MCP for Education

As an AI engineer building ANKR Learning Platform, I wanted to share the technical architecture for fellow builders.

PROBLEM:
Traditional chatbots hallucinate. Fine-tuning is expensive ($10K+) and slow (weeks). We needed answers from specific textbooks, not general knowledge.

SOLUTION: RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)

ARCHITECTURE:
1️⃣ Document Ingestion
   → Upload PDF → Extract text → Clean → Chunk (512 tokens)
   → Generate embeddings (nomic-embed-text, 768 dimensions)
   → Store in PostgreSQL + pgvector

2️⃣ Query Processing
   → User question → Create query embedding
   → Cosine similarity search → Top 5 chunks
   → Rerank by relevance

3️⃣ Answer Generation
   → Context (top chunks) + Question → LLM
   → Generate answer + citations
   → Stream to user

WHY RAG > FINE-TUNING:
✅ Cost: $0 vs $10,000+
✅ Speed: Instant vs weeks
✅ Updates: Just upload new docs
✅ Accuracy: Cites sources

TECH STACK:
• Database: PostgreSQL 14 + pgvector
• Backend: Fastify + GraphQL
• AI: Ollama (local) + AI Proxy (fallback)
• Embeddings: nomic-embed-text (FREE!)
• Frontend: React 18 + Vite
• TTS: edge-tts (FREE unlimited)

MCP (Model Context Protocol):
We're building 255+ tools that AI can use:
• Document tools (upload, chunk, embed)
• Query tools (search, cite, retrieve)
• Generation tools (quiz, audio, summary)
• Integration tools (WhatsApp, email, export)

PERFORMANCE:
• Query response: <500ms
• 1000 pages indexed in <5 minutes
• Scales to millions of embeddings
• Works offline after initial download

CHALLENGES SOLVED:
1. PDF parsing (complex layouts)
2. Multi-language support (22 languages)
3. Citation extraction (page numbers)
4. Offline-first (service workers)

OPEN SOURCE:
Releasing in 12 months under Apache 2.0

CODE: github.com/ankr-labs (coming soon)
DOCS: ankr.in/project/documents/
