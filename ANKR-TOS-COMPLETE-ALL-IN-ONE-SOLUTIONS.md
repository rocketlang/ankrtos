## 🎯 Module 10: Workforce Management & Shift Scheduling

### **Overview**
Inspired by **ANKR TMS** driver management and **retail/manufacturing** shift optimization systems.

### **Key Features**

#### **1. Intelligent Shift Scheduling**

**Auto-Scheduling Engine:**
```
Inputs:
• Staff availability (full-time, part-time, casual)
• Skill matrix (crane operator, gate officer, foreman)
• Equipment requirements (3 RTGs need 3 operators)
• Vessel schedule (peak hours: vessel arrival/departure)
• Labor laws (max hours, break times, overtime rules)
• Employee preferences (preferred shifts, days off)

AI Optimization:
→ Generate optimal shift roster
→ Minimize overtime costs
→ Maximize skill utilization
→ Ensure regulatory compliance
→ Balance workload fairly

Output:
• 7-day/14-day/30-day shift schedule
• Automatic notifications (SMS/email to employees)
• Mobile app access (swap shifts, request time off)
• Real-time adjustments (someone calls in sick → auto-reassign)
```

**Example Shift Schedule:**
```

#### **2. What-If Scenario Planning**

**Simulation Engine:**
```
Scenario 1: "What if vessel volumes grow 15% instead of 8%?"
→ Run simulation with 15% growth rate
→ Result: Berth 4 needed by Q4 2026 (1 year earlier!)
→ Equipment: Need 1 additional RTG in 2026
→ Yard capacity: Will reach 95% by 2028 (risky!)

Scenario 2: "What if we reduce gate turnaround time to 10 min?"
→ Run simulation with faster gate processing
→ Result: Can handle +30% more truck traffic
→ Revenue impact: +$2M/year (more containers)
→ Investment needed: $500k (additional OCR lanes)

Scenario 3: "What if shipping line X switches to competitor?"
→ Simulate loss of customer (12% of revenue)
→ Result: Need to fill capacity with new customers
→ Marketing budget: Increase by $200k
→ Pricing: Offer 10% discount to attract new lines
```

#### **2. Route Optimization**

**AI-Powered Dispatch:**
```
Scenario: 10 containers need to move from Yard → Gate

Traditional approach:
• Manual assignment (planner assigns trucks)
• Inefficient routing (trucks travel empty)
• Delays (some trucks idle while others overloaded)

ANKR TMS AI Optimization:
1. Analyze all pending tasks (10 gate-out requests)
2. Check truck locations (GPS real-time)
3. Calculate optimal routes (minimize distance + time)
4. Assign tasks to nearest available trucks
5. Send instructions to driver mobile apps

Result:
• 30% reduction in travel distance
• 25% faster completion time
• Balanced workload across drivers
• Lower fuel consumption
```

**Example Route Plan:**
```
Truck PM #3:
├─ Task 1: Yard B-12 → Gate 2 (Container MSCU1234567)
├─ Task 2: Gate 2 → Yard C-05 (Empty pickup) [Backhaul!]
└─ Task 3: Yard C-05 → Berth 1 (Export container)

Total distance: 3.2 km
Est. time: 15 minutes
Fuel saved: 0.5 liters (vs. empty travel)
```

#### **3. External Trucking Company Integration**

**Trucker Portal:**
```
Features for external truckers:
• Appointment booking (time slots)
• Real-time queue status
• Turn time tracking (performance metrics)
• Preferred carrier program (frequent visitors get priority)

## 🎯 Module 16: Warehouse Management System (WMS)

### **Overview**
**Inspired by ANKR WMS** - manage CFS (Container Freight Station) operations for LCL cargo.

### **Use Cases**

#### **1. LCL Cargo Handling**

**Container Freight Station (CFS):**
```
Scenario: Import container MSCU1234567 has LCL cargo (20 consignments)

Workflow:
1. Container gate-in → CFS warehouse
2. Destuffing (unload cargo from container)
3. Sort by consignee (20 different receivers)
4. Label + barcode each carton
5. Put-away to warehouse slots
6. Await consignee pickup or inland delivery

WMS tracks:
• SKU-level inventory (5,000 cartons in warehouse)
• Slot occupancy (12,000 sq ft, 78% full)
• Aging (how long cargo has been in warehouse)
• Delivery status (picked up, dispatched, pending)
```

**Warehouse Slot Optimization:**
