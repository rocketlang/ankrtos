The geometric mean of two positive numbers a\nand b is the number ab. Therefore, the geometric mean of 2 and 8 is 4. We\nobserve that the three numbers 2,4,8 are consecutive terms of a G .P. This leads to a\ngeneralisation of the concept of geometric means of two numbers.\nGiven any two positive numbers a and b, we can insert as many numbers as\nwe like between them to make the resulting sequence in a G .P.\nLet G1, G2,…, Gn be  n numbers between positive numbers a and b \nsuch that\na,G1,G2,G3,…,Gn,b is a G .P.

We shall\nuse the following notations with these formulae:\na = the first term, r = the common ratio, l = the last term,\nn = the numbers of terms,\nSn = the sum of first n terms.\n8.4.1  General term of a G  .P. Let us consider a G .P. with first non-zero term ‘ a’ and\ncommon ratio ‘ r’. Write a few terms of it. The second  term is obtained by multiplying\na by r, thus a2 = ar. Similarly , third term is obtained by multiplying a2 by r. Thus,\na3 = a2r = ar2, and so on.\nWe write below these and few more terms.\n1st term = a1 = a = ar1–1, 2nd term = a2 = ar = ar2–1, 3rd term = a3 = ar2 = ar3–1\n4th term = a4 = ar3 = ar4–1, 5th term = a5 = \nar4 = ar5–1\nDo you see a pattern?

Also, we define a sequence as a function whose domain is the\nset of natural numbers or some subsets of the type {1, 2, 3, .... k}. A sequence\ncontaining a finite number of terms is called a finite sequence . A sequence is\ncalled infinite  if it is not a finite sequence.\n®Let a1, a2, a3, ... be the sequence, then the sum expressed as a1 + a2 + a3 + ...\nis called series . A series is called finite series  if it has got finite number of\nterms.\n®A sequ ence is said to be a geometric pr ogression  or G.P., if the ratio of any\nterm to its preceding term is same throughout. This constant factor is called\nthe common ratio . Usually , we denote the first term of a G .P. by a and its\ncommon ratio by r. The general or the nth term of G .P. is given by an= arn – 1.\nThe sum Sn of the first n terms of G .P. is given by\n( ) ( )  – 1 1– \nS 11 1 – n n\nna r a r\n= or , if rr – r≠\n®The geometric mean (G .M.) of any two positive numbers a and b is given by\nab i.e., the sequence a, G, b is G .P.\nHistorical Note\nEvidence is found that Babylonians, some 4000 years ago, knew of arithmetic and\ngeometric sequences. According to Boethius (510), arithmetic and geometric\nsequences were known to early Greek writers. Among the Indian mathematician,\nAryabhatta (476) was the first to give the formula for the sum of squares and cubes\nof natural numbers in his famous work Aryabhatiyam, written around\n499. He also gave the formula for finding the sum to n terms of an arithmetic\nsequence starting with pth term. Noted Indian mathematicians Brahmgupta\nReprint 2025-26\n\n150       MA THEMA TICS\n—vvvvv—(598), Mahavira (850) and Bhaskara (1 114-1185) also considered the sum of squares\nand cubes.  Another specific type of sequence having important applications in\nmathematics, called Fibonacci sequence , was discovered by Italian mathematician\nLeonardo Fibonacci (1 170-1250). Seventeenth century witnessed the classification\nof series into specific forms. In 1671 James Gregory used the term infinite series in\nconnection with infinite sequence. It was only through the rigorous development of\nalgebraic and set theoretic tools that the concepts related to sequence and series\ncould be formulated suitably .\nReprint 2025-26\n\n",
