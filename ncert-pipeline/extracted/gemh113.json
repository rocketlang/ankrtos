      "content": "Chapter  13\n13.1  I NTRODUCTION : PLANE FIGURES  AND SOLID SHAPES\nIn this chapter , you will classify figures you have seen in terms of what is known as\ndimension .\nIn our day to day life, we see several objects like books, balls, ice-cream cones etc.,\naround us which have different shapes. One thing common about most of these objects is\nthat they all have some length, breadth and height or depth.\nThat is, they all occupy space and have three dimensions.\nHence, they are called three dimensional shapes.\nDo you remember some of the three dimensional shapes (i.e., solid shapes) we have\nseen in earlier classes?\nTRY THESE\nFig 13.1(i) (a)Cuboid (iv) (d) Sphere\n(ii) (b)Cylinder (v) (e)Pyramid\n(iii) (c)Cube (vi) (f)ConeMatch the shape with the name:\n2024-25\n\nVISUALISING SOLID SHAPES 199\nTry to identify some objects shaped like each of these.\nBy a similar argument, we can say figures drawn on paper which have only length and\nbreadth are called two dimensional (i.e., plane) figures. We have also seen some two\ndimensional figures in the earlier classes.\nMatch the 2 dimensional figures with the names (Fig 13.2):\n(i) (a)Circle\n(ii) (b) Rectangle\n(iii) (c)Square\n(iv) (d) Quadrilateral\n(v) (e)Triangl e\nFig 13.2\nNote: We can write 2-D in short for 2-dimension and 3-D in short for\n3-dimension.\n13.2  F ACES, EDGES AND VERTICES\nDo you remember the Faces, Vertices and Edges of solid shapes, which you studied\nearlier?  Here you see them for a cube:\n         (i)             (ii)            (iii)\nFig 13.3\nThe 8 corners of the cube are its vertices . The 12 line segments that form the\nskeleton of the cube are its edges . The 6 flat square surfaces that are the skin of the\ncube are its faces .\n2024-25\n\nMATHEMA TICS 200\nCan you see that, the two dimensional figures can be identified as the faces of the\nthree dimensional shapes?  For example a cylinder  has two faces which are circles,\nand a pyramid, shaped like this  has triangles as its faces.\nWe will now try to see how some of these  3-D shapes can be visualised on a 2-D\nsurface, that is, on paper .\nIn order to do this, we would like to get familiar with three dimensional objects closely .\nLet us try forming these objects by making what are called nets.\n13.3  N ETS FOR BUILDING  3-D S HAPES\nTake a cardboard box.  Cut the edges to lay the box flat.  You have now a net for that box.\nA net is a sort of skeleton-outline in 2-D [Fig13.4 (i)], which, when folded [Fig13.4 (ii)],\nresults in a 3-D shape [Fig13.4 (iii)].DO THIS\nVertex\nFace\nEdgeFace\nVertex\nEdge\nFaces (F) 6 4\nEdges (E) 12\nVertices (V) 8 4\nComplete the following table:\nTable 13.1\n(i) (ii) (iii)\nFig 13.4\n2024-25\n\nVISUALISING SOLID SHAPES 201\nHere you got a net by suitably separating the edges. Is the\nreverse process possible?\nHere is a net pattern for a box (Fig 13.5). Copy an enlarged\nversion of the net and try to make the box by suitably folding\nand gluing together . (You may use suitable units). The box is a\nsolid. It is a 3-D object with the shape of a cuboid.\nSimilarly , you can get a net for a cone by cutting a slit along\nits slant surface (Fig 13.6).\nYou have dif ferent nets for dif ferent shapes.  Copy\nenlarged versions of the nets given (Fig 1 3.7) and try to make\nthe 3-D shapes indicated. (Y ou may also like to prepare skeleton\nmodels using strips of cardboard fastened with paper c lips).Fig 13.5\nCube\n(i)Cone\n(iii)Cylinder\n(ii)Fig 13.6\nWe could also try to make a net for making a pyramid like the Great Pyramid in Giza\n(Egypt) (Fig 13.8). That pyramid has a square base and triangles on the four sides.Fig 13.7\nFig 13.9Fig 13.8\nSee if you can make it with the given net (Fig 13.9).\n2024-25\n\nMATHEMA TICS 202\nEXERCISE  13.1\n1.Identify the nets which can be used to make cubes (cut out copies of the nets and try it):\n(i) (ii) (iii)\n(iv) (v) (vi)\n2.Dice are cubes with dots on each face.  Opposite faces of a die always have a total\nof seven dots on them.\nHere are two nets to make dice (cubes); the numbers inserted in each square indicate\nthe number of dots in that box.\nInsert suitable numbers in the blanks, remembering that the number\non the opposite faces should total to 7.\n3.Can this be a net for a die?\nExplain your answer .TRY THESE\nHere you find four nets (Fig 13.10). There are two correct nets among them to make\na tetrahedron.  See if you can work out which nets will make a tetrahedron.\nFig 13.10\n1    2\n3     4\n5    6\n2024-25\n\nVISUALISING SOLID SHAPES 203\n4.Here is an incomplete net for making a cube. Complete it in at least two different\nways. Remember that a cube has six faces. How many are there in the net here?\n(Give two separate diagrams.  If you like, you may use a squared sheet for easy\nmanipulation.)\n5.Match the nets with appropriate solids:\n(a) (i)\n(b) (ii)\n(c) (iii)\n(d) (iv)\nPlay this game\nYou and your friend sit back-to-back. One of you reads out a net to make a 3-D shape,\nwhile the other attempts to copy it and sketch or build the described 3-D object.\n13.4  D RAWING SOLIDS ON A FLAT SURFACE\nYour drawing surface is paper , which is flat. When you draw a solid shape, the images are\nsomewhat distorted to make them appear three-dimensional. It is a visual illusion. You will\nfind here two techniques to help you.\n13.4.1  Oblique Sketches\nHere is a picture of a cube (Fig 13.1 1). It gives a clear idea of how the cube looks like,\nwhen seen from the front. You do not see certain faces. In the drawn picture, the lengths Fig 13.1 1\n2024-25\n\nMATHEMA TICS 204\nare not equal, as they should be in a cube. Still, you are able to recognise it as a cube. Such\na sketch of a solid is called an oblique sketch .\nHow can you draw such sketches? Let us attempt to learn the technique.\nYou need a squared (lines or dots) paper .  Initially practising to draw on these sheets will\nlater make it easy to sketch them on a plain sheet (without the aid of squared lines or dots!)\nLet us attempt to draw an oblique sketch of a 3 × 3 × 3 (each edge is 3 units) cube (Fig 1 3.12).\nStep 1 Step 2\nDraw the front  face. Draw the opposite  face. Sizes of the\nfaces have to be same, but the sketch\nis somewhat off-set from step 1.\nStep 3 Step 4\nJoin the corresponding corners Redraw using dotted lines for\nhidden edges. (It is a convention)\nThe sketch is ready now .\nFig 13.12\nIn the oblique sketch above, did you note the following?\n(i)The sizes of the front faces and its opposite are same; and\n(ii)The edges, which are all equal in a cube, appear so in the sketch, though the actual\nmeasures of edges are not taken so.\nYou could now try to make an oblique sketch of a cuboid (remember the faces in this\ncase are rectangles)\nNote: You can draw sketches in which measurements also agree with those of a given\nsolid. To do this we need what is known as an isometric sheet . Let us try to\n2024-25\n\nVISUALISING SOLID SHAPES 205\nmake a cuboid with dimensions 4 cm length, 3 cm breadth and 3 cm height on\ngiven isometric sheet.\n13.4.2  Isometric Sketches\nHave you seen an isometric dot sheet? (A sample is given at the end of the book). Such a\nsheet divides the paper into small equilateral triangles made up of dots or lines. To draw\nsketches in which measur ements also agr ee with those of the solid, we can use isometric\ndot sheets. [Given on inside of the back cover (3rd cover page).]\nLet us attempt to draw an isometric sketch of a cuboid of dimensions 4 × 3 × 3 (which\nmeans the edges forming length, breadth and height are 4, 3, 3 units respectively) (Fig 1 3.13).\nStep 1 Step 2\nDraw a r ectangle to show the Draw four parallel line segments of\nfront face. length 3 star ting fr om the four corners\nof the r ectangle.\nStep 3 Step 4\nConnect the matching corners This is an isometric sketch\nwith appr opriate line segments. of the cuboid.\nFig 13.14 (i) Fig 13.14 (ii)Fig 13.13\nNote that the measurements are of exact size in an isometric sketch;\nthis is not so in the case of an oblique sketch.\nEXAMPLE  1Here is an oblique sketch of a cuboid [Fig 13.14(i)].\nDraw an isometric sketch that matches this drawing.\nSOLUTION Here is the solution [Fig 13.14(ii)]. Note how the\nmeasurements are taken care of.\n2024-25\n\nMATHEMA TICS 206\nHow many units have you taken along (i) ‘length’? (ii) ‘breadth’? (iii) ‘height’? Do\nthey match with the units mentioned in the oblique sketch?\nEXERCISE  13.2\n1.Use isometric dot paper and make an isometric sketch for each one of the\ngiven shapes:\nFig 13.15\n2.The dimensions of a cuboid are 5 cm, 3 cm and 2 cm.  Draw three different isometric\nsketches of this cuboid.\n3.Three cubes each with 2 cm edge are placed side by side to form a cuboid. Sketch\nan oblique or isometric sketch of this cuboid.\n4.Make an oblique sketch for each one of the given isometric shapes:\n(i) (ii)\n(iii)(iv)\n2024-25\n\nVISUALISING SOLID SHAPES 207\n5.Give (i) an oblique sketch and (ii) an isometric sketch for each of the following:\n(a)A cuboid of dimensions 5 cm, 3 cm and 2 cm.  (Is your sketch unique?)\n(b)A cube with an edge 4 cm long.\nAn isometric sheet is attached at the end of the book. You could try to make on it some\ncubes or cuboids of dimensions specified by your friend.\n13.4.3  Visualising Solid Objects\nSometimes when you look at combined shapes, some of them may be hidden\nfrom your view .\nHere are some activities you could try in your free time to help you visualise some solid\nobjects and how they look. Take some cubes and arrange them as shown in\nFig 13.16.\nFig 13.16\nNow ask your friend to guess how many cubes there are when observed from the\nview shown by the arrow mark.\nTry to guess the number of cubes in the following arrangements (Fig 13.17).DO THIS\nHow\nmany\ncubes?\n(i) (ii) (iii)\nTRY THESE\n(i) (iii) (ii)\nFig 13.17\n2024-25\n\nMATHEMA TICS 208\nSuch visualisation is very helpful. Suppose you form a cuboid by joining such cubes.\nYou will be able to guess what the length, breadth and height of the cuboid would be.\nEXAMPLE  2If two cubes of dimensions 2 cm by 2cm by 2cm are\nplaced side by side, what would the dimensions of the\nresulting cuboid be?\nSOLUTION As you can see (Fig 13.18) when kept side by side, the\nlength is the only measurement which increases, it be\ncomes 2 + 2 = 4 cm.\nThe breadth = 2 cm and the height = 2 cm.\n 1.Two dice are placed side by side as shown: Can you say what the total would be\non the face opposite to\n(a)5 + 6 (b)4 + 3\n(Remember that in a die sum of numbers on opposite faces is 7)\n 2.Three cubes each with 2 cm edge are placed side by side to form a cuboid. Try\nto make an oblique sketch and say what could be its length, breadth and height.\n13.5  V IEWING  DIFFERENT  SECTIONS  OF A SOLID\nNow let us see how an object which is in 3-D can be viewed in different ways.\n13.5.1 One W ay to View an Object is by Cutting or Slicing\nSlicing game\nHere is a loaf of bread (Fig 13.20).  It is like a cuboid with a square face. You  ‘slice’  it\nwith a knife.\nWhen you give a ‘vertical’ cut, you get several pieces, as shown in the\nFigure 13.20.   Each face of the piece is a square!  We call this face a\n‘cross-section’  of the whole bread.  The cross section is nearly a square in\nthis case.\nBeware! If your cut is not ‘vertical’ you may get a different cross section!\nThink about it. The boundary of the cross-section you obtain is a plane\ncurve.  Do you notice it?\nA kitchen play\nHave you noticed cross-sections of some vegetables when they are cut for the purposes\nof cooking in the kitchen?  Observe the various slices and get aware of the shapes that\nresult as cross-sections.Fig 13.18\nTRY THESE\nFig 13.19\nFig 13.20\n2024-25\n\nVISUALISING SOLID SHAPES 209\nPlay this\nMake clay (or plasticine) models of the following solids and make vertical or horizontal cuts.\nDraw rough sketches of the cross-sections you obtain.  Name them wherever you can.\nFig 13.21\nEXERCISE  13.3\n1.What cross-sections do you get when you give a\n(i)vertical cut (ii)horizontal cut\nto the following solids?\n(a)A brick (b)A round apple (c)A die\n(d)A circular pipe (e)An ice cream cone\n13.5.2  Another W ay is by Shadow Play\nA shadow play\nShadows are a good way to illustrate how three-dimensional objects can be viewed in two\ndimensions. Have you seen a shadow play ? It is a form of   entertainment using solid\narticulated figures in front of an illuminated back-drop to create the illusion of moving\nimages.  It makes some indirect use of ideas in Mathematics.\nYou will need a source of light and a few solid shapes for this activity . (If\nyou have an overhead projector , place the solid under the lamp and do\nthese investigations.)\nKeep a torchlight, right in fr ont of  a Cone. What type of shadow does\nit cast on the screen? (Fig 13.23)\nThe solid is three-dimensional; what is the dimension of the shadow?\nIf, instead of a cone, you place a cube in the above game, what type of shadow will\nyou get?\nExperiment with different positions of the source of light and with different positions of\nthe solid object. Study their effects on the shapes and sizes of the shadows you get.\nHere is another funny experiment that you might have tried already: Place a circular\nplate in the open when the Sun at the noon time is just right   above  it as shown in\nFig 13. 24 (i). What is the shadow that you obtain?\nFig 13.22\nFig 13.23\n(i)\n2024-25\n\nMATHEMA TICS 210\nWill it be same during\n(a)   forenoons? (b)   evenings?\nFig 13.24 (i) - (iii)\nStudy the shadows in relation to the position of the Sun and the time of observation.\nEXERCISE  13.4\n1.A bulb is kept burning just right above the following solids.  Name the shape of the\nshadows obtained in each case.  Attempt to give a rough sketch of the shadow .\n(You may try to experiment first and then answer these questions).\nA ball A cylindrical pipe A book\n(i) (ii) (iii)\n2.Here are the shadows of some 3-D objects, when seen under the lamp of an overhead\nprojector .  Identify the solid(s) that match each shadow . (There may be multiple\nanswers for these!)\nA circle A square A triangle A rectangle\n   (i) (ii) (iii) (iv)(ii)(iii)\n2024-25\n\nVISUALISING SOLID SHAPES 211\n3.Examine if the following are true statements:\n(i)The cube can cast a shadow in the shape of a rectangle.\n(ii)The cube can cast a shadow in the shape of a hexagon.\n13.5.3 A Thir d Way is by Looking at it fr om Certain Angles\nto Get Different Views\nOne can look at an object standing in front of it or by the side of it or from above. Each\ntime one will get a different view (Fig 13.25).\nFig 13.25\nHere is an example of how one gets different views of a given building. (Fig 13.26)\nBuilding Front view Side view Top view\nFig 13.26\nYou could do this for figures made by joining cubes.\nFig 13.27\nTry putting cubes together and then making such sketches from dif ferent sides.\nFront view Side view Top view\n2024-25\n\nMATHEMA TICS 212\n 1.For each solid, the three views (1), (2), (3) are given. Identify for each solid the\ncorresponding top, front and side views.\nSolid Its views\n(1) (2) (3)\n2.Draw a view of each solid as seen from the direction indicated by the arrow .TRY THESE\n(i) (ii) (iii)\n2024-25\n\nVISUALISING SOLID SHAPES 213\nWHAT HAVE WE DISCUSSED ?\n1.The circle, the square, the rectangle, the quadrilateral and the triangle are examples\nof plane figur es; the cube, the cuboid, the sphere, the cylinder , the cone and the\npyramid are examples of solid shapes .\n2.Plane figures are of two-dimensions  (2-D) and the solid shapes are of\nthree-dimen sions ( 3-D).\n3.The corners of a solid shape are called its vertices ; the line segments of its skeleton\nare its edges ; and its flat surfaces are its faces .\n4.A net is a skeleton-outline of a solid that can be folded to make it.  The same solid\ncan have several types of nets.\n5.Solid shapes can be drawn on a flat surface (like paper) realistically . We call this\n2-D representation of a 3-D solid .\n6.Two types of sketches of a solid are possible:\n(a)An oblique sketch  does not have proportional lengths. Still it conveys all important\naspects of the appearance of the solid.\n(b)An isometric sketch  is drawn on an isometric dot paper , a sample of which is\ngiven at the end of this book.  In an isometric sketch of the solid the measurements\nkept proportional.\n7.Visualising solid shapes  is a very useful skill.  You should be able to see ‘hidden’\nparts of the solid shape.\n8.Different sections of a solid can be viewed in many ways:\n(a)One way is to view by cutting or slicing  the shape, which would result in the\ncross-section of the solid.\n(b)Another way is by observing a 2-D shadow  of a 3-D shape.\n(c)A third way is to look at the shape from dif\nferent angles; the fr ont-view , the\nside-view  and the top-view  can provide a lot of information about the shape\nobserved.\n2024-25\n\n",
