      "content": "Chapter 4.learn the symbols and combining capacity of\nthe elements.\nThe combining power (or capacity) of an\nelement is known as its valency. V alency can\nbe used to find out how the atoms of an\nelement will combine with the atom(s) of\nanother element to form a chemical compound.\nThe valency of the atom of an element can be\nthought of as hands or arms of that atom.\nHuman beings have two arms and an\noctopus has eight. If one octopus has to catch\nhold of a few people in such a manner that all\nthe eight arms of the octopus and both arms\nof all the humans are locked, how many\nhumans do you think the octopus can hold?\nRepresent the octopus with O and humans\nwith H. Can you write a formula for this\ncombination? Do you get OH4 as the formula?\nThe subscript 4 indicates the number of\nhumans held by the octopus.\nThe valencies of some common ions are\ngiven in T able 3.6. W e will lear n mor e about\nvalency in the next chapter .\n* Some elements show mor e than one valency. A Roman numeral shows their valency in a bracket.Table 3.5: Some ionic compounds\nIonic Constituting Ratio\nCompound Elements by\nMass\nCalcium oxide Calcium and\noxygen 5:2\nMagnesium Magnesium\nsulphide and sulphur 3:4\nSodium Sodium\nchloride and chlorine 23:35.5\n3.4Writing Chemical Formulae\nThe chemical formula of a compound is a\nsymbolic representation of its composition.

Formula of carbon tetrachloride\nFor magnesium chloride, we write the\nsymbol of cation (Mg2+) first followed by the\nsymbol of anion (Cl-). Then their char ges ar e\ncriss-cr ossed to get the for mula.\n4.\nFormula of magnesium chloride\nFormula : MgCl2\nThus, in magnesium chloride, ther e are\ntwo chloride ions (Cl-) for each magnesium\nion (Mg2+). The positive and negative char ges\nmust balance each other and the overall\nstructur e must be neutral. Note that in the\nformula, the charges on the ions are\nnot indicated.\nSome more examples\n(a) Formula for aluminium oxide:\nFormula : Al2O3\n(b) Formula for calcium oxide:\nHere, the valencies of the two elements\nare the same. Y ou may arrive at the for mula\nCa2O2. But we simplify the for mula as CaO.The rules that you have to follow while writing\na chemical formula are as follows:\n•the valencies or charges on the ion\nmust balance.\n•when a compound consists of a metal and\na non-metal, the name or symbol of the\nmetal is written first. For example: calcium\noxide (CaO), sodium chloride (NaCl), iron\nsulphide (FeS), copper oxide (CuO), etc.,\nwhere oxygen, chlorine, sulphur are non-\nmetals  and are written on the right,\nwhereas calcium, sodium, iron and\ncopper are metals, and are written on\nthe left.\n•in compounds formed with polyatomic ions,\nthe number of ions present in the\ncompound is indicated by enclosing the\nformula of ion in a bracket and writing the\nnumber of ions outside the bracket. For\nexample, Mg (OH)2. In case the number of\npolyatomic ion is one, the bracket is not\nrequired. For example, NaOH.\n3.4.1 FORMULAE  OF SIMPLE  COMPOUNDS\nThe simplest compounds, which are made up\nof two different elements are called binary\ncompounds. V alencies of some ions ar e given\nin Table 3.6. Y ou can use these to write\nformulae for compounds.\nWhile writing the chemical formulae for\ncompounds, we write the constituent elements\nand their valencies as shown below. Then we\nmust crossover the valencies of the\ncombining atoms.\nExamples\n1. Formula of hydrogen chloride\nFormula of the compound would be HCl.\n2. Formula of hydrogen sulphide\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSCIENCE 34 3434 34342.Write down the names of\ncompounds represented by the\nfollowing formulae:\n(i)Al2(SO4)3\n(ii)CaCl2\n(iii) K2SO4\n(iv) KNO3\n(v)CaCO3.\n3.What is meant by the term\nchemical formula?\n4.How many atoms are present in a\n(i)H2S molecule and\n(ii)PO43– ion?\n3.5Molecular Mass\nIn section 3.2.2 we discussed the concept of\natomic mass. This concept can be extended to\ncalculate molecular masses. The molecular\nmass of a substance is the sum of the atomic\nmasses of all the atoms in a molecule of the\nsubstance. I t is therefore the relative mass of\na molecule expressed in atomic mass units (u).\nExample 3.1 Example 3.1 Example 3.1 Example 3.1 Example 3.1 (a) C alculate the relative\nmolecular mass of water (H2O).\n(b) Calculate the molecular mass of\nHNO3.\nSolution: Solution:Solution:Solution:Solution:\n(a)Atomic mass of hydrogen =1u,\noxygen =16 u\nSo the molecular mass of water , which\ncontains two atoms of hydrogen and one\natom of oxygen is =2 ´\n 1+ 1´16\n=18 u\n(b) The molecular mass of HNO3 = the\natomic mass of H + the atomic mass of\nN+ 3 ´ the atomic mass of O\n= 1 + 14 + 48 = 63 u\n3.5.1 FORMULA  UNIT MASS\nThe formula unit mass of a substance is a sum\nof the atomic masses of all atoms in a formula\nunit of a compound. F ormula unit mass is\ncalculated in the same manner as we calculate\nthe molecular mass. The only dif ference is that(c)     Formula of sodium nitrate:\nFormula : NaNO3\n(d) Formula of calcium hydroxide:\nFormula : C a(OH)2\nNote that the formula of calcium\nhydroxide is C a(OH)2 and not C aOH2. We use\nbrackets when we have two or more of the\nsame ions in the formula. H ere, the bracket\naround O H with a subscript 2 indicates that\nthere are two hydroxyl (O H) groups joined to\none calcium atom. I n other words, there are\ntwo atoms each of oxygen and hydrogen in\ncalcium hydroxide.\n(e) Formula of sodium carbonate:\nFormula : N a2CO3\nIn the above example, brackets are not ne eded\nif there is only one ion present.\n(f) Formula of ammonium sulphate:\nFormula : (NH4)2SO4\nQuestions\n1.Write down the formulae of\n(i)sodium oxide\n(ii)aluminium chloride\n(iii) sodium sulphide\n(iv) magnesium hydroxide\nReprint 2025-26\n\nATOMS AND MOLECULES 35What\nyou have\nlearnt\n• During a chemical reaction, the sum of the masses of the\nreactants and  products remains unchanged. This is known\nas the Law of Conservation of Mass.\n• In a pure chemical compound, elements are always present\nin a definite proportion by mass. This is known as the Law\nof Definite Proportions.\n• An atom is the smallest particle of the element that cannot\nusually exist independently and retain all its chemical\nproperties.\n• A molecule is the smallest particle of an element or a\ncompound capable of independent existence under ordinary\nconditions. It shows all the properties of the substance.\n• A chemical formula of a compound shows its constituent\nelements and the number of atoms of each combining\nelement.\n• Clusters of atoms that act as an ion are called polyatomic\nions.  They carry a fixed charge on them.\n• The chemical formula of a molecular compound is\ndetermined by the valency of each element.\n• In ionic compounds, the charge on each ion is used to\ndetermine the chemical formula of the compound.we use the word formula unit for those\nsubstances whose constituent particles are\nions. For example, sodium chloride as\ndiscussed above, has a formula unit NaCl. Its\nformula unit mass can be calculated as–\n1 × 23 + 1 ×\n 35.5 = 58.5 u\nExample 3.2 Calculate the formula unit\nmass of CaCl2.\nSolution:\nAtomic mass of Ca\n+ (2 × atomic mass of Cl)\n= 40 + 2 × 35.5 = 40 + 71 = 111 uQuestions\n1.Calculate the molecular masses\nof H2, O2, Cl2, CO2, CH4, C2H6,\nC2H4, NH3,  CH3OH.\n2.Calculate the for mula unit\nmasses of ZnO, Na2O, K2CO3,\ngiven atomic masses of Zn = 65 u,\nNa = 23 u, K = 39 u, C = 12 u,\nand O = 16 u.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSCIENCE 36\nGroup Activity\nPlay a game for writing formulae.\nExample1 : Make placards with symbols and valencies of the\nelements separately.
