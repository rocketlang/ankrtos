As far as your eyes can see, there are numbers, numbers and\nnumbers!\nFig. 1.2\nNow suppose you start walking along the number line, and collecting some of the\nnumbers. Get a bag ready to store them!\nReprint 2025-26\n\n2 MATHEMA TICS\n3\n-40166\n22-752190Z\n 3\n4016\n745\n2\n60142258\n0-3-757\n-66-21-40\n3171\n3\n4016\n745 2\n60129580\nW\n9\n4016\n745\n2601465258\n0311\n7110NYou might begin with picking up only natural\nnumbers like 1, 2, 3, and so on. You know that this list\ngoes on for ever . (Why is this true?) So, now your\nbag contains infinitely many natural numbers! Recall\nthat we denote this collection by the symbol N.\nNow turn and walk all the way back, pick up\nzero and put it into the bag. You now have the\ncollection of whole numbers which is denoted by\nthe symbol W.\nNow , stretching in front of you are many , many negative integers. Put all the\nnegative integers into your bag. What is your new collection? Recall that it is the\ncollection of all integers , and it is denoted by the symbol Z.\nAre there some numbers still left on the line? Of course! There are numbers like\n1 3,\n2 4, or even 2005\n2006−. If you put all such numbers also into the bag, it will now be theZ comes from the\nGerman word\n“zahlen”, which means\n“to coun t”.\nQ\n–6721\n121\n3\n–1\n981\n161\n420052006–12\n139\n14–6625\n-65\n601919\n9990–6727 58\n200\n52006\n3\n–516\n60999\n4\n–8–662558\n0\n277117\n981\n–12\n13\n89–6\n7\n2\n39\n14–Why Z ?\nReprint 2025-26\n\nNUMBER  SYSTEMS 3\ncollection of rational numbers. The collection of rational numbers is denoted by Q.\n‘Rational’ comes from the word ‘ratio’, and Q comes from the word ‘quotient’.\nYou may recall the definition of rational numbers:\nA number ‘ r’ is called a rational number , if it can be written in the form p\nq,\nwhere p and q are integers and q ≠ 0. (Why do we insist that q ≠ 0?)\nNotice that all the numbers now in the bag can be written in the form p\nq, where p\nand q are integers and q ≠ 0. For example, –25 can be written as 25;1− here p = –25\nand q = 1. Therefore, the rational numbers also include the natural numbers, whole\nnumbers and integers.\nYou also know that the rational numbers do not have a unique representation in\nthe form p\nq, where p and q are integers and q ≠ 0. For example, 1\n2 = 2\n4 = 10\n20 = 25\n50\n= 47\n94, and so on. These are equivalent rational numbers (or fractions ). However ,\nwhen we say that p\nq is a rational number , or when we represent p\nq on the number\nline, we assume that q ≠ 0 and that  p and q have no common factors other than 1\n(that is, p and q are co-prime ). So, on the number line, among the infinitely many\nfractions equivalent to 1\n2, we will choose 1\n2 to represent all of them.\nNow , let us solve some examples about the dif ferent types of numbers, which you\nhave studied in earlier classes.\nExample 1 :  Are the following statements true or false? Give reasons for your answers.\n(i)Every whole number is a natural number .\n(ii)Every integer is a rational number .\n(iii)Every rational number is an integer .\nSolution :  (i)False, because zero is a whole number but not a natural number .\n(ii)True, because every integer m can be expressed in the form 1m, and so it is a\nrational number .\nReprint 2025-26\n\n4 MATHEMA TICS\n(iii)False, because 3\n5 is not an integer .\nExample 2 :  Find five rational numbers between 1 and 2.\nWe can approach this problem in at least two ways.\nSolution 1 :  Recall that to find a rational number between r and s, you can add r and\ns and divide the sum by 2, that is 2r s+ lies between r and s. So, 3\n2 is a number\nbetween 1 and 2. You can proceed in this manner to find four more rational numbers\nbetween 1 and 2. These four numbers are 5 11 13 7. , , and4 8 8 4\nSolution 2 :  The other option is to find all the five rational numbers in one step. Since\nwe want five numbers, we write 1 and 2 as rational numbers with denominator 5 + 1,\ni.e., 1 = 6\n6 and 2 = 12\n6. Then you can check that 7\n6, 8\n6, 9\n6, 10\n6 and 11\n6 are all rational\nnumbers between 1 and 2. So, the five numbers are 7 4 3 5 11,, , and6 3 2 3 6.\nRemark :  Notice that in Example 2, you were asked to find five rational numbers\nbetween 1 and 2. But, you must have realised that in fact there are infinitely many\nrational numbers between 1 and 2. In general, there are infinitely many rational\nnumbers between any two given rational numbers .\nLet us take a look at the number line again. Have you picked up all the numbers?\nNot, yet. The fact is that there are infinitely many more numbers left on the number\nline! There are gaps in between the places of the numbers you picked up, and not just\none or two but infinitely many . The amazing thing is that there are infinitely many\nnumbers lying between any two of these gaps too!\nSo we are left with the following questions:\n1.What are the numbers, that are left on the number\nline, called?\n2.How do we recognise them? That is, how do we\ndistinguish them from the rationals (rational\nnumbers)?\nThese questions will be answered in the next section.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nNUMBER  SYSTEMS 5\nEXERCISE 1.1\n1.Is zero a rational number? Can you write it in the form p\nq, where p and q are integers\nand q ≠ 0?\n2.Find six rational numbers between 3 and 4.\n3.Find five rational numbers between 3\n5 and 4\n5.\n4.State whether the following statements are true or false. Give reasons for your answers.\n(i)Every natural number is a whole number .\n(ii)Every integer is a whole number .\n(iii)Every rational number is a whole number .\n1.2 Irrational Numbers\nWe saw , in the previous section, that there may be numbers on the number line that\nare not rationals. In this section, we are going to investigate these numbers. So far , all\nthe numbers you have come across, are of the form p\nq, where p and q are integers\nand q ≠ 0. So, you may ask: are there numbers which are not of this form? There are\nindeed such numbers.\nThe Pythagoreans in Greece, followers of the famous\nmathematician and philosopher Pythagoras, were the first\nto discover the numbers which were not rationals, around\n400 BC. These numbers are called irrational numbers\n(irrationals ), because they cannot be written in the form of\na ratio of integers. There are many myths surrounding the\ndiscovery of irrational numbers by the Pythagorean,\nHippacus of Croton. In all the myths, Hippacus has an\nunfortunate end, either for discovering that 2 is irrational\nor for disclosing the secret about 2 to people outside the\nsecret Pythagorean sect!\n Let us formally define these numbers.\nA number ‘s’ is called irrational, if it cannot be written in the form p\nq, where p\nand q are integers and q ≠ 0.Pythagoras\n(569 BCE – 479 BCE)\nFig. 1.3\nReprint 2025-26\n\n6 MATHEMA TICS\n200520063\n–516\n60999\n4\n–8–662558\n0\n277117\n981\n–12\n13\n89\n–672\n39\n14\n-65\n–66\n26\n-45036\n19R\nYou already know that there are infinitely many rationals. It turns out that there\nare infinitely many irrational numbers too. Some examples are:\n2, 3, 15, , π, 0.101 10111011110...\nRemark :  Recall that when we use the symbol , we assume that it is the\npositive square root of the number . So 4 = 2, though both 2 and –2 are square\nroots of 4.\nSome of the irrational numbers listed above are familiar to you. For example, you\nhave already come across many of the square roots listed above and the number π.\nThe Pythagoreans proved that 2 is irrational. Later in approximately 425 BC,\nTheodorus of Cyrene showed that 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13,  14, 15\nand 17 are also irrationals. Proofs of irrationality of 2, 3, 5, etc., shall be\ndiscussed in Class X.  As to π, it was known to various cultures for thousands of\nyears, it was proved to be irrational by Lambert and Legendre only in the late 1700s.\nIn the next section, we will discuss why 0.101 10111011110... and π are irrational.\nLet us return to the questions raised at the end of\nthe previous section. Remember the bag of rational\nnumbers. If we now put all irrational numbers into\nthe bag, will there be any number left on the number\nline? The answer is no! It turns out that the collection\nof all rational numbers and irrational numbers together\nmake up what we call the collection of real numbers ,\nwhich is denoted by R. Therefore, a real number is either rational or irrational. So, we\ncan say that every real number is represented by a unique point on the number\nline. Also, ever y point on the number  line r epresents a unique r eal number .\nThis is why we call the number line, the real number line .\nIn the 1870s two German mathematicians,\nCantor and Dedekind, showed that :\nCorresponding to every real number , there is a\npoint on the real number line, and corresponding\nto every point on the number line, there exists a\nunique real number .\nG. Cantor  (1845-1918)\nFig. 1.5R. Dedekind (1831-1916)\nFig. 1.4\nReprint 2025-26\n\nNUMBER  SYSTEMS 7\nLet us see how we can locate some of the irrational numbers on the number line.\nExample 3 :  Locate 2 on the number line.\nSolution :  It is easy to see how the Greeks might have discovered\n",

You should have noticed at least three things:\n(i) The remainders either become 0 after a certain stage, or start repeating themselves.\n(ii) The number of entries in the repeating string of remainders is less than the divisor\n(in 10\n3 one number repeats itself and the divisor is 3, in 1\n7 there are six entries\n326451 in the repeating string of remainders and 7 is the divisor).\n(iii) If the remainders repeat, then we get a repeating block of digits in the quotient\n(for 10\n3, 3 repeats in the quotient and for 1\n7, we get the repeating block 142857\nin the quotient).\nReprint 2025-26\n\n10 MATHEMA TICS\nAlthough we have noticed this pattern using only the examples above, it is true for all\nrationals of the form p\nq (q ≠ 0). On division of p by q, two main things happen – either\nthe remainder becomes zero or never becomes zero and we get a repeating string of\nremainders. Let us look at each case separately .\nCase (i) :  The remainder becomes zero\nIn the example of 7\n8, we found that the remainder becomes zero after some steps and\nthe decimal expansion of 7\n8 = 0.875. Other examples are 1\n2 = 0.5, 639\n250 = 2.556. In all\nthese cases, the decimal expansion terminates or ends after a finite number of steps.\nWe call the decimal expansion of such numbers terminating .\nCase (ii) :  The remainder never becomes zero\nIn the examples of 10\n3 and 1\n7, we notice that the remainders repeat after a certain\nstage forcing the decimal expansion to go on for ever . In other words, we have a\nrepeating block of digits in the quotient. We say that this expansion is non-terminating\nrecurring. For example, 10\n3 = 3.3333... and 1\n7 = 0.142857142857142857...\nThe usual way of showing that 3 repeats in the quotient of 10\n3 is to write it as 3.3.\nSimilarly , since the block of digits 142857 repeats in the quotient of 1\n7, we write 1\n7 as\n0. 142857 , where the bar above the digits indicates the block of digits that repeats.\nAlso 3.57272... can be written as 3.572 . So, all these examples give us non-terminating\nrecurring (repeating ) decimal expansions.\nThus, we see that the decimal expansion of rational numbers have only two choices:\neither they are terminating or non-terminating recurring.\nNow suppose, on the other hand, on your walk on the number line, you come across a\nnumber like 3.142678 whose decimal expansion is terminating or a number like\n1.272727... that is, 1.27 , whose decimal expansion is non-terminating recurring, can\nyou conclude that it is a rational number? The answer is yes!\nReprint 2025-26\n\nNUMBER  SYSTEMS 11\nWe will not prove it but illustrate this fact with a few examples. The terminating cases\nare easy .\nExample 6 :  Show that 3.142678 is a rational number . In other words, express 3.142678\nin the form p\nq, where p and q are integers and q ≠ 0.\nSolution :  We have 3.142678 = 3142678\n1000000, and hence is a rational number .\nNow , let us consider the case when the decimal expansion is non-terminating recurring.\nExample 7 :  Show that 0.3333... = 0 3. can be expressed in the form p\nq, where p and\nq are integers and q ≠ 0.\nSolution :  Since we do not know what 0 3. is , let us call it ‘ x’ and so\nx =0.3333...\nNow here is where the trick comes in. Look at\n10 x =10 × (0.333...) = 3.333...\nNow, 3.3333... = 3 + x, since x = 0.3333...\nTherefore, 10 x =3 + x\nSolving for x, we get\n9x =3, i.e., x = 1\n3\nExample 8 :  Show that 1.272727... = 1 27. can be expressed in the form p\nq, where p\nand q are integers and q ≠ 0.\nSolution :  Let x = 1.272727... Since two digits are repeating, we multiply x by 100 to\nget\n100 x =127.2727...\nSo, 100 x =126 + 1.272727... = 126 + x\nTherefore, 100 x – x =126, i.e., 99 x = 126\nReprint 2025-26\n\n12 MATHEMA TICS\ni.e., x =126 14\n99 11=\nYou can check the reverse that 14\n11 = 1 27..\nExample 9 :  Show that 0.2353535... = 0 235.  can be expressed in the form p\nq,\nwhere p and q are integers and q ≠ 0.\nSolution :  Let x  = 0 235. . Over here, note that 2 does not repeat, but the block 35\nrepeats. Since two digits are repeating, we multiply x by 100 to get\n100 x =23.53535...\nSo, 100 x =23.3 + 0.23535... = 23.3 + x\nTherefore, 99 x =23.3\ni.e., 99 x =233\n10, which gives x = 233\n990\nYou can also check the reverse that 233\n990 = 0 235. .\nSo, every number with a non-terminating recurring decimal expansion can be expressed\nin the form p\nq (q ≠ 0), where p and q are integers. Let us summarise our results in the\nfollowing form :\nThe decimal expansion of a rational number is either terminating or non-\nterminating r ecur ring. Mor eover , a number whose decimal expansion is\nterminating or non-terminating r ecurring is rational.\nSo, now we know what the decimal expansion of a rational number can be. What\nabout the decimal expansion of irrational numbers? Because of the property above,\nwe can conclude that their decimal expansions are non-terminating non-r ecurring.\nSo, the property for irrational numbers, similar to the property stated above for rational\nnumbers, is\nThe decimal expansion of an irrational number is non-terminating non-r ecurring.\nMoreover , a number whose decimal expansion is non-terminating non-r ecurring\nis irrational.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nNUMBER  SYSTEMS 13\nRecall s = 0.101 10111011110... from the previous section. Notice that it is non-\nterminating and non-recurring. Therefore, from the property above, it is irrational.\nMoreover , notice that you can generate infinitely many irrationals similar to s.\nWhat about the famous irrationals 2 and π? Here are their decimal expansions up\nto a certain stage.\n2 = 1.4142135623730950488016887242096...\n   π = 3.14159265358979323846264338327950...\n(Note that, we often take 22\n7 as an approximate value for π, but π ≠ 22\n7.)\nOver the years, mathematicians have developed various techniques to produce more\nand more digits in the decimal expansions of irrational numbers. For example, you\nmight have learnt to find digits in the decimal expansion of 2 by the division method.\nInterestingly , in the Sulbasutras (rules of chord), a mathematical treatise of the Vedic\nperiod (800 BC - 500 BC), you find an approximation of 2 as follows:\n2 = 1 1 1 1 1 11 1 41421563 4 3 34 4 3.   + + × − × × =       \nNotice that it is the same as the one given above for the first five decimal places. The\nhistory of the hunt for digits in the decimal expansion of π is very interesting.\nThe Greek genius Archimedes was the first to compute\ndigits in the decimal expansion of π. He showed 3.140845\n< π < 3.142857. Aryabhatta (476 – 550 C.E.), the great\nIndian mathematician and astronomer , found the value\nof π correct to four decimal places (3.1416). Using high\nspeed computers and advanced algorithms, π has been\ncomputed to over 1.24 trillion decimal places!\nNow , let us see how to obtain irrational numbers.\nExample 10 :  Find an irrational number between 1\n7 and 2\n7.\nSolution :  We saw that 1\n7 = 0142857. . So, you can easily calculate 20 2857147.= .\nTo find an irrational number between 1\n7 and 2\n7, we find a number which isArchimedes (287 BCE – 212 BCE)\nFig. 1.10\nReprint 2025-26\n\n14 MATHEMA TICS\nnon-terminating non-recurring lying between them. Of course, you can find infinitely\nmany such numbers.\nAn example of such a number is 0.150150015000150000...\nEXERCISE 1.3\n1.Write the following in decimal form and say what kind of decimal expansion each\nhas :\n(i)36\n100(ii)1\n11(iii)148\n(iv)3\n13(v)2\n11(vi)329\n400\n2.You know that 1\n7 = 0142857. .

Moreover , if we add,\nsubtract, multiply or divide (except by zero) two rational numbers, we still get a rational\nnumber (that is, rational numbers are ‘closed’ with respect to addition, subtraction,\nmultiplication and division). It turns out that irrational numbers also satisfy the\ncommutative, associative and distributive laws for addition and multiplication. However ,\nthe sum, difference, quotients and products of irrational numbers are not always\nirrational. For example, ()() 6 6+ − ,()()()() 2 2 3 3 , − ⋅  and 17\n17 are\nrationals.\nLet us look at what happens when we add and multiply a rational number with an\nirrational number . For example, 3 is irrational. What about 2 3+  and 2 3 ? Since\n3 has a non-terminating  non-recurring decimal expansion, the same is true for\n2 3+  and 2 3 . Therefore, both 2 3+  and 2 3  are also irrational numbers.\nExample 1 1 : Check whether 7 5 , 72 21 2\n5, , + π −  are irrational numbers or\nnot.\nSolution :  5 = 2.236... , 2 = 1.4142..., π = 3.1415...\nThen 7 5  = 15.652..., 7\n5 = 7 5 7 5\n5 5 5=  = 3.1304...\n2 + 21 = 22.4142..., π – 2 = 1.1415...\nAll these are non-terminating non-recurring decimals. So, all these are irrational numbers.\nNow , let us see what generally happens if we add, subtract, multiply , divide, take\nsquare roots and even nth roots of these irrational numbers, where n is any natural\nnumber . Let us look at some examples.\nExample 12 :  Add 2 2 5 3 +  and 2 3 3– .\nSolution :  ( )( ) 2 2 5 3 2 3 3 – + +  = ( )( ) 2 2 2 5 3 3 3 – + +\n                 = (2 + 1) 2 (5 3) 3 3 2 2 3 + − = +\nReprint 2025-26\n\n16 MATHEMA TICS\nExample 13 :  Multiply 6 5  by 2 5 .\nSolution :  6 5  × 2 5  = 6 × 2 × 5 × 5 = 12 × 5 = 60\nExample 14 :  Divide 8 15  by 2 3 .\nSolution :  8 3 58 15 2 3 4 5\n2 3×÷ = =\nThese examples may lead you to expect the following facts, which are true :\n(i)The sum or difference of a rational number and an irrational number is irrational.\n(ii)The product or quotient of a non-zero rational number with an irrational number is\nirrational.\n(iii)If we add, subtract, multiply or divide two irrationals, the result may be rational or\nirrational.\nWe now turn our attention to the operation of taking square roots of real numbers.\nRecall that, if a is a natural number , then a b= means b2 = a and b > 0. The same\ndefinition can be extended for positive real numbers.\nLet a > 0 be a real number . Then a = b means b2 = a and b > 0.\nIn Section 1.2, we saw how to represent n for any positive integer n on the number\nline. We now show how to find x for any given positive real number x geometrically .\nFor example, let us find it for x = 3.5, i.e., we find 3 5. geometrically .\nFig. 1.1 1\nMark the distance 3.5 units from a fixed point A on a given line to obtain a point B such\nthat AB = 3.5 units (see Fig. 1.1 1). From B, mark a distance of 1 unit and mark the\nnew point as C. Find the mid-point of AC and mark that point as O. Draw a semicircle\nwith centre O and radius OC. Draw a line perpendicular to AC passing through B and\nintersecting the semicircle at D. Then, BD = 3.5.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nNUMBER  SYSTEMS 17\nMore generally , to find x, for any positive real\nnumber x, we mark B so that AB = x units, and, as in\nFig. 1.12, mark C so that BC = 1 unit. Then, as we\nhave done for the case x = 3.5, we find BD = x\n(see Fig. 1.12). We can prove this result using the\nPythagoras Theorem.\nNotice that, in Fig. 1.12, ∆ OBD is a right-angled triangle. Also, the radius of the circle\nis 1\n2x+ units.\nTherefore, OC = OD = OA = 1\n2x+ units.\nNow , OB = 1 1\n2 2x xx+ − − = ⋅  \nSo, by the Pythagoras Theorem, we have\nBD2 = OD2 – OB2 = 2 21 1 4\n2 2 4x x xx+ −   − = =       .\nThis shows that BD = x.\nThis construction gives us a visual, and geometric way of showing that x exists for\nall real numbers x > 0. If you want to know the position of x on the number line,\nthen let us treat the line BC as the number line, with B as zero, C as 1, and so on.\nDraw an arc with centre B and radius BD, which intersects the number line in E\n(see Fig. 1.13). Then, E represents x.\nFig. 1.13Fig. 1.12\nReprint 2025-26\n\n18 MATHEMA TICS\nWe would like to now extend the idea of square roots to cube roots, fourth roots,\nand in general nth roots, where n is a positive integer . Recall your understanding of\nsquare roots and cube roots from earlier classes.\nWhat is 38? Well, we know it has to be some positive number whose cube is 8, and\nyou must have guessed 38 = 2. Let us try 5243. Do you know some number b such\nthat b5 = 243? The answer is 3. Therefore, 5243 = 3.\nFrom these examples, can you define na for a real number a > 0 and a positive\ninteger n?\nLet a > 0 be a real number and n be a positive integer . Then na = b, if bn = a and\nb > \n0. Note that the symbol ‘ ’ used in 32, 8,na, etc. is called the radical sign .\nWe now list some identities relating to square roots, which are useful in various\nways. You are already familiar with some of these from your earlier classes. The\nremaining ones follow from the distributive law of multiplication over addition of real\nnumbers, and from the identity ( x + y) (x – y) = x2 – y2, for any real numbers x and y.\nLet a and b be positive real numbers.

Look at 1\n2⋅ Can you tell\nwhere it shows up on the number line? You know that it is irrational. May be it is easier\nto handle if the denominator is a rational number . Let us see, if we can ‘rationalise’  the\ndenominator , that is, to make the denominator into a rational number . To do so, we\nneed the identities involving square roots. Let us see how .\nExample 16 :  Rationalise the denominator of 1\n2⋅\nSolution :  We want to write 1\n2 as an equivalent expression in which the denominator\nis a rational number . We know that 2.2 is rational. We also know that multiplying\n1\n2 by 2\n2 will give us an equivalent expression, since 2\n2 = 1. So, we put these two\nfacts together to get\n1 1 2 2\n2 2 2 2= × = ⋅\nIn this form, it is easy to locate 1\n2 on the number line.

But before we state these laws, and to even\nmake sense of these laws, we need to first understand what, for example 3\n24 is. So,\nwe have some work to do!\nWe define na for a real number a > 0 as follows:\nLet a > 0 be a real number and n a positive integer . Then na = b, if bn = a and\nb > 0.\nIn the language of exponents, we define na = 1\nna.

Moreover ,\na number whose decimal expansion is non-terminating non-recurring is irrational.\n5.All the rational and irrational numbers make up the collection of real numbers.\n6.If r is rational and s is irrational, then r\n + s and r – s are irrational numbers, and rs and r\ns are\nirrational numbers, r ≠ 0.\n7.For positive real numbers a and b, the following identities hold:\n(i) ab a b= (ii)a a\nb b=\n(iii)( )( ) a b a b a b+ − = − (iv)( )( )2a b a b a b+ − = −\n(v)( )2\n2 a b a ab b+ = + +\n8.To rationalise the denominator of 1,\na b+ we multiply this by ,a b\na b−\n− where a and b are\nintegers.\n9.Let a > 0 be a real number and p and q be rational numbers.
