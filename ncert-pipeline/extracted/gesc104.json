It is extractedfrom lichens  (Fig. 4.1a). It has a\nmauve (purple) colour in distilledwater. When added to an acidicsolution, it turns red and when\nadded to a basic solution, it turns\nblue. It is available in the form of asolution, or in the form of strips of\npaper, known as litmus paper.\nGenerally, it is available as red andblue litmus paper (Fig. 4.1b).\nCan I taste all substances to\nfind their taste?\nNo. Have you not read the\ncaution? We should not\ntaste unknown\nsubstances.

If\npossible make solutions in distilled water.\nRecord your observations as in\nTable. 4.2.\nIn your Table, are there any\nsubstances on which litmus had no\neffect? Name those substances.\nThe solutions which do not change\nthe colour of either red or blue litmusare known as neutral solutions. These\nsubstances are neither acidic nor basic.\nTo prepare limewater, take some water in a tumbler and add some lime ( chuna)\ninto it. Stir the solution and keep it for some time.

On the other hand, when thesolution is acidic, it remains colourless.\nFig. 4.4  Process of neutralisationDemonstrate the effect of the threeindicators on each of these solutions.Record your observations in Table 4.5.\n4.3 N EUTRALISATION\nWe have learnt that acids turn bluelitmus red and bases turn red litmus\nblue. Let us see what happens when an\nacid is mixed with a base.\nWe are going to use an indicator you\nhave not used so far. It is calledphenolphthalein .\nActivity 4.5\nTo be demonstrated by the teacher in\nthe class\nFill one fourth of a test tube with dilute\nhydrochloric acid. Note down its colour.Note down the colour of phenolphthalein\nsolution also. Add 2–3 drops of theindicator to the acid. Now shake the test\ntube gently. Do you observe any change\nin colour of the acid?\nAdd to the acidic solution a drop of\nsodium hydroxide solution by a dropper.Are you familiar with the term acid rain? Have you ever heard about damagingeffect of acid rain? As the name indicates the rain containing excess of acids is\ncalled an acid rain. Where do these acids come from? The rain becomes acidic\nbecause carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide (which are releasedinto the air as pollutants) dissolve in rain drops to form carbonic acid, sulphuric\nacid and nitric acid respectively. Acid rain can cause damage to buildings,\nhistorical monuments, plants and animals.\nCAUTION\nGreat care should be taken whilehandling laboratory acids and basesbecause these are corrosive in nature,\nirritating and harmful to skin.\nBase\nAcid + Indicator\nReprint 2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 44When an acidic solution is mixed\nwith a basic solution, both the solutions\nneutralise the effect of each other. When\nan acid solution and a base solution are\nmixed in suitable amounts, both theacidic nature of the acid and the basic\nnature of the base are destroyed. The\nresulting solution is neither acidic norbasic. Touch the test tube immediately\nafter neutralisation. What do you\nobserve? In neutralisation reaction, heatis always produced, or evolved. The\nevolved heat raises the temperature of\nthe reaction mixture.\nIn neutralisation reaction a new\nsubstance is formed. This is called salt.Salt may be acidic, basic or neutral innature. Thus, neutralisation can be\ndefined as follows:\nThe reaction between an acid and\na base is known as neutralisation. Saltand water are produced in this process\nwith the evolution of heat.\nAcid+Base  Salt+Water\n     (Heat is evolved)\nThe following reaction is an example:Hydrochloric acid (HCl) + Sodium\nhydroxide (NaOH) \nSodium chloride (NaCl) + Water (H\n2O)\nBoojho added dilute sulphuric acid\nto lime water. Will the reaction mixturebecome hot or cool?\n4.4 N EUTRALISATION  IN EVERYDAY\nLIFE\nIndigestion\nOur stomach contains hydrochloricacid. It helps us to digest food, as youhave learnt in Chapter 2. But toomuch of acid in the stomach causesindigestion. Sometimes indigestion\nis painful. To relieve indigestion, we\ntake an antacid such as milk ofmagnesia, which contains magnesium\nhydroxide. It neutralises the effect of\nexcessive acid.\nAnt bite\nWhen an ant bites, it injectsthe acidic liquid (formic acid) into theskin. The effect of the acid can be\nneutralised by rubbing moist baking\nsoda (sodium hydrogencarbonate) orcalamine solution, which contains zinc\ncarbonate.\nSoil treatment\nExcessive use of chemical fertilisers\nmakes the soil acidic. Plants do notgrow well when the soil is either too\nacidic  or too basic . When the soil is\ntoo acidic, it is treated with bases like\nquick lime (calcium oxide) or slaked\nlime (calcium hydroxide). If the soil\nis basic, organic matter (compost) is\nadded to it. Organic matter releases\nacids which neutralises the basic\nnature of the soil.\nFactory wastes\nThe wastes of many factoriescontain acids. If they are allowed to\nflow into the water bodies, the acids\nwill kill fish and other organisms.The factory wastes are, therefore,\nneutralised by adding basic\nsubstances.\nReprint 2024-25\n\nACIDS, BASES AND SALTS 45\nWhat you have learnt\nAcids are sour in taste. Generally, bases are bitter in taste and soapy to\ntouch.\nAcid turns blue litmus red. Bases turn red litmus blue.\nSubstances which are neither acidic nor basic are called neutral.\nSolutions of substances that show different colour in acidic, basic andneutral solutions are called indicators.\nAn acid and a base neutralise each other and form a salt. A salt may beacidic, basic or neutral in nature.\nExercises\n1. State differences between acids and bases.\n2. Ammonia is found in many household products, such as window\ncleaners. It turns red litmus blue. What is its nature?\n3. Name the source from which litmus solution is obtained. What is the\nuse of this solution?\n4. Is the distilled water acidic/basic/neutral? How would you verify it?5. Describe the process of neutralisation with the help of an example.\n6. Mark ‘T’ if the statement is true and ‘F’ if it is false:\n(i) Nitric acid turn red litmus blue. (T/F)\n(ii) Sodium hydroxide turns blue litmus red. (T/F)\n(iii) Sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid neutralise each other and\nform salt and water. (T/F)\n(iv) Indicator is a substance which shows different colours in acidic\nand basic solutions. (T/F)\n(v) Tooth decay is caused by the presence of a base. (T/F)\n7. Dorji has a few bottles of soft drink in his restaurant. But, unfortu-\nnately, these are not labelled. He has to serve the drinks on the demand\nof customers.
