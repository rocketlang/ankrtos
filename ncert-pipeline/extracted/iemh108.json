A quadrilateral\nhas four sides, four angles and four vertices. A parallelogram is a quadrilateral in\nwhich both pairs of opposite sides are parallel.\nLet us perform an activity .\nCut out a parallelogram from a sheet of paper\nand cut it along a diagonal (see Fig. 8.1). You obtain\ntwo triangles. What can you say about these\ntriangles?\nPlace one triangle over the other . Turn one around,\nif necessary . What do you observe?\nObserve that the two triangles are congruent to\neach other .\nRepeat this activity with some more parallelograms. Each time you will observe\nthat each diagonal divides the parallelogram into two congruent triangles.\nLet us now prove this result.\nTheorem 8.1 :  A diagonal of a parallelogram divides it into two congruent\ntriangles .\nProof :  Let ABCD be a parallelogram and AC be a diagonal (see Fig. 8.2). Observe\nthat the diagonal AC divides parallelogram ABCD into two triangles, namely , ∆ ABC\nand ∆ CDA. We need to prove that these triangles are congruent.\nFig. 8.1\nReprint 2025-26\n\nQUADRILA TERALS 105\nIn ∆ ABC and ∆ CDA, note that BC || AD and AC is a transversal.\nSo, ∠ BCA = ∠ DAC (Pair of alternate angles)\nAlso, AB || DC and AC is a transversal.\nSo, ∠ BAC = ∠ DCA (Pair of alternate angles)\nand AC = CA (Common)\nSo, ∆ ABC ≅ ∆ CDA (ASA rule)\nor,diagonal AC divides parallelogram ABCD into two congruent\ntriangles ABC and CDA.\nNow , measure the opposite sides of parallelogram ABCD. What do you observe?\nYou will find that AB = DC and AD = BC.\nThis is another property of a parallelogram stated below:\nTheor em 8.2 :  In a parallelogram, opposite sides ar e equal .\nYou have already proved that a diagonal divides the parallelogram into two congruent\ntriangles; so what can you say about the corresponding parts say , the corresponding\nsides? They are equal.\nSo, AB = DC and AD = BC\nNow what is the converse of this result? You already know that whatever is given\nin a theorem, the same is to be proved in the converse and whatever is proved in the\ntheorem it is given in the converse. Thus, Theorem 8.2 can be stated as given below :\nIf a quadrilateral is a parallelogram, then each pair of its opposite sides is equal. So\nits converse is :\nTheorem 8.3 :  If each pair of opposite sides of a quadrilateral is equal, then it\nis a parallelogram .\nCan you reason out why?\nLet sides AB and CD of the quadrilateral ABCD\nbe equal and also  AD = BC (see Fig. 8.3). Draw\ndiagonal AC.\nClearly , ∆ ABC ≅∆ CDA (Why?)\nSo, ∠ BAC = ∠ DCA\nand ∠ BCA = ∠ DAC (Why?)\nCan you now say that ABCD is a parallelogram? Why?Fig. 8.2\nFig. 8.3\nReprint 2025-26\n\n106 MATHEMA TICS\nYou have just seen that in a parallelogram each pair of opposite sides is equal and\nconversely if each pair of opposite sides of a quadrilateral is equal, then it is a\nparallelogram. Can we conclude the same result for the pairs of opposite angles?\nDraw a parallelogram and measure its angles. What do you observe?\nEach pair of opposite angles is equal.\nRepeat this with some more parallelograms. We arrive at yet another result as\ngiven below .\nTheor em 8.4 :  In a parallelogram, opposite angles ar e equal .\nNow , is the converse of this result also true? Yes. Using the angle sum property of\na quadrilateral and the results of parallel lines intersected by a transversal, we can see\nthat the converse is also true. So, we have the following theorem :\nTheorem 8.5 :  If in a quadrilateral, each pair of opposite angles is equal, then\nit is a parallelogram .\nThere is yet another property of a parallelogram. Let us study the same. Draw a\nparallelogram ABCD and draw both its diagonals intersecting at the point O\n(see Fig. 8.4).\nMeasure the lengths of OA, OB, OC and OD.\nWhat do you observe? You will observe that\nOA = OC and OB = OD.\nor,O is the mid-point of both the diagonals.\nRepeat this activity with some more parallelograms.\nEach time you will find that O is the mid-point of\nboth the diagonals.\nSo, we have the following theorem :\nTheor em 8.6 :  The diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other .\nNow , what would happen, if in a quadrilateral the diagonals bisect each other?\nWill it be aparallelogram? Indeed this is true.\nThis result is the converse of the result of Theorem 8.6. It is given below:\nTheor em 8.7 :  If the diagonals of a quadrilateral bisect each other , then it is a\nparallelogram .\nYou can reason out this result as follows:Fig. 8.4\nReprint 2025-26\n\nQUADRILA TERALS 107\nNote that in Fig. 8.5, it is given that OA = OC\nand OB = OD.\nSo,          ∆ AOB ≅ ∆ COD (Why?)\nTherefore, ∠ ABO = ∠ CDO (Why?)\nFrom this, we get AB || CD\nSimilarly ,         BC || AD\nTherefore ABCD is a parallelogram.\nLet us now take some examples.\nExample 1 :  Show that each angle of a rectangle is a right angle.\nSolution :  Let us recall what a rectangle is.\nA rectangle is a parallelogram in which one angle is a right angle.\n Let ABCD be a rectangle in which ∠ A = 90°.\nWe have to show that ∠ B = ∠ C = ∠ D = 90°\nWe have, AD || BC and AB is a transversal\n(see Fig. 8.6).\nSo, ∠ A + ∠ B = 180° (Interior angles on the same\n side of the transversal)\nBut, ∠ A =90°\nSo, ∠ B = 180° – ∠ A = 180° – 90° = 90°\nNow, ∠ C = ∠ Aand ∠ D = ∠ B\n(Opposite angles of the parallellogram)\nSo, ∠ C = 90° and ∠ D = 90°.\nTherefore, each of the angles of a rectangle is a right angle.\nExample 2 :  Show that the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular to each other .\nSolution :  Consider the rhombus ABCD (see Fig. 8.7).\nYou know that  AB = BC = CD = DA  (Why?)\nNow , in ∆ AOD and ∆ COD,\nOA = OC (Diagonals of a parallelogram\nbisect each other)\nOD = OD (Common)\nAD = CDFig. 8.5\nFig. 8.6\nFig. 8.7\nReprint 2025-26\n\n108 MATHEMA TICS\nTherefore, ∆ AOD ≅ ∆ COD\n(SSS congruence rule)\nThis gives, ∠ AOD = ∠ COD (CPCT)\nBut, ∠ AOD + ∠ COD = 180° (Linear pair)\nSo, 2∠ AOD = 180°\nor, ∠ AOD = 90°\nSo, the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular to each other .\nExample 3 :  ABC is an isosceles triangle in which AB = AC. AD bisects exterior\nangle P AC and CD || AB (see Fig. 8.8). Show that\n(i) ∠ DAC = ∠ BCA and (ii) ABCD is a parallelogram.\nSolution :  (i) ∆ ABC is isosceles in which AB = AC (Given)\nSo, ∠ ABC = ∠ ACB (Angles opposite to equal sides)\nAlso, ∠ PAC = ∠ ABC + ∠ ACB\n(Exterior angle of a triangle)\nor, ∠ PAC = 2∠ ACB (1)\nNow , AD bisects ∠ PAC.\nSo, ∠ PAC = 2∠ DAC (2)\nTherefore,\n2∠ DAC = 2∠ ACB [From (1) and (2)]\nor, ∠ DAC = ∠ ACB\n(ii) Now , these equal angles form a pair of alternate angles when line segments BC\nand AD are intersected by a transversal AC.\nSo, BC || AD\nAlso, BA || CD (Given)\nNow , both pairs of opposite sides of quadrilateral ABCD are parallel.\nSo, ABCD is a parallelogram.\nExample 4 :  Two parallel lines l \nand m are intersected by a transversal p\n(see Fig. 8.9). Show that the quadrilateral formed by the bisectors of interior angles is\na rectangle.Fig. 8.8\nReprint 2025-26\n\nQUADRILA TERALS 109\nSolution :  It is given that PS  || QR and transversal p intersects them at points A and\nC respectively .\nThe bisectors of ∠ PAC and ∠ ACQ intersect at B and bisectors of ∠ ACR and\n∠ SAC intersect at D.\nWe are to show that quadrilateral ABCD is a\nrectangle.\nNow, ∠ PAC = ∠ ACR\n(Alternate angles as l || m and p is a transversal)\nSo,1\n2∠ PAC =1\n2 ∠ ACR\ni.e., ∠ BAC = ∠ ACD\nThese form a pair of alternate angles for lines AB\nand DC with AC as transversal and they are equal also.\nSo, AB || DC\nSimilarly , BC || AD (Considering ∠ ACB and ∠ CAD)\nTherefore, quadrilateral ABCD is a parallelogram.\nAlso, ∠ PAC + ∠ CAS = 180° (Linear pair)\nSo,1\n2 ∠ PAC +1\n2 ∠ CAS =1\n2 × 180° = 90°\nor, ∠ BAC + ∠ CAD = 90°\nor, ∠ BAD = 90°\nSo,ABCD is a parallelogram in which one angle is 90°.\nTherefore, ABCD is a rectangle.\nExample 5 :  Show that the bisectors of angles of a parallelogram form a rectangle.\nSolution :  Let P , Q, R and S be the points of\nintersection of the bisectors of ∠ A and ∠ B,  ∠ B\nand ∠ C, ∠ C and ∠ D, and ∠ D and ∠ A respectively\nof parallelogram ABCD (see Fig. 8.10).\nIn ∆ ASD, what do you observe?\nSince DS bisects ∠ D and AS bisects ∠ A,  therefore,Fig. 8.9\nFig. 8.10\nReprint 2025-26\n\n110 MATHEMA TICS\n∠ DAS + ∠ ADS =1\n2 ∠ A + 1\n2∠ D\n=1\n2 (∠ A + ∠ D)\n=1\n2 × 180° (∠ A and ∠ D are interior angles\non the same side of the transversal)\n=90°\nAlso, ∠ DAS + ∠ ADS + ∠ DSA  =180° (Angle sum property of a triangle)\nor, 90° + ∠ DSA = 180°\nor, ∠ DSA = 90°\nSo, ∠ PSR = 90° (Being vertically opposite to ∠ DSA)\nSimilarly , it can be shown that ∠ APB = 90° or ∠ SPQ = 90°  (as it was shown for\n∠ DSA). Similarly , ∠ PQR = 90° and ∠ SRQ = 90°.\nSo, PQRS is a quadrilateral in which all angles are right angles.\nCan we conclude that it is a rectangle? Let us examine. We have shown that\n∠ PSR = ∠ PQR = 90° and ∠ SPQ = ∠ SRQ = 90°. So both pairs of opposite angles\nare equal.\nTherefore, PQRS is a parallelogram in which one angle (in fact all angles) is 90° and\nso, PQRS is a rectangle.\nEXERCISE 8.1\n1.If the diagonals of a parallelogram are equal, then show that it is a rectangle.\n2.Show that the diagonals of a square are equal and bisect each other at right angles.\n3.Diagonal AC of a parallelogram ABCD bisects\n∠ A (see Fig. 8.1 1). Show that\n(i)it bisects ∠ C also,\n(ii)ABCD is a rhombus.\n4.ABCD is a rectangle in which diagonal AC bisects\n∠ A as well as ∠ C. Show that: (i) ABCD is a square\n(ii) diagonal BD bisects ∠ B as well as ∠ D.Fig. 8.1 1\nReprint 2025-26\n\nQUADRILA TERALS 111\n5.In parallelogram ABCD, two points P  and Q are\ntaken on diagonal BD such that DP = BQ\n(see Fig. 8.12). Show that:\n(i)∆ APD ≅ ∆ CQB\n(ii)AP = CQ\n(iii) ∆ AQB ≅ ∆ CPD\n(iv)AQ = CP\n(v)APCQ is a parallelogram\n6.ABCD is a parallelogram and AP and CQ are\nperpendiculars from vertices A and C on diagonal\nBD (see Fig. 8.13). Show that\n(i)∆ APB ≅ ∆ CQD\n(ii)AP = CQ\n7.ABCD is a trapezium in which AB || CD and\nAD = BC (see Fig. 8.14). Show that\n(i)∠ A = ∠ B\n(ii)∠ C = ∠ D\n(iii)∆ ABC ≅ ∆ BAD\n(iv)diagonal AC = diagonal BD\n[Hint :Extend AB and draw a line through C\nparallel to DA  intersecting AB produced at E.]\n8.2 The Mid-point Theorem\nYou have studied many properties of a triangle as well as a quadrilateral. Now let us\nstudy yet another result which is related to the mid-point of sides of a triangle. Perform\nthe following activity .\nDraw a triangle and mark the mid-points E and F of two sides of the triangle. Join\nthe points E and F (see Fig. 8.15).\nMeasure EF and BC. Measure ∠ AEF and ∠ ABC.\nWhat do you observe? You will find that :\nEF = 1\n2 BC and ∠ AEF = ∠ ABC\nso, EF || BC\nRepeat this activity with some more triangles.\nSo,you arrive at the following theorem:Fig. 8.12\nFig. 8.13\nFig. 8.14\nFig. 8.15\nReprint 2025-26\n\n112 MATHEMA TICS\nTheorem 8.8 :  The line segment joining the mid-points of two sides of a triangle\nis parallel to the thir d side .\nYou can prove this theorem using the following\nclue:\nObserve Fig 8.16 in which E and F are mid-points\nof AB and AC respectively and CD || BA.\n∆ AEF ≅∆ CDF (ASA Rule)\nSo, EF = DF and BE = AE = DC (Why?)\nTherefore, BCDE is a parallelogram. (Why?)\nThis gives EF || BC.\nIn this case, also note that EF = 1\n2 ED = 1\n2BC.\nCan you state the converse of Theorem 8.8? Is the converse true?\nYou will see that converse of the above theorem is also true which is stated as\nbelow:\nTheor em 8.9 :  The line drawn thr ough the mid-point of one side of a triangle,\nparallel to another side bisects the thir d side .\nIn Fig 8.17, observe that E is the mid-point of\nAB, line l is passsing through E and is parallel to BC\nand CM || BA.\nProve that AF = CF by using the congruence of\n∆ AEF and ∆ CDF .\nExample 6 :  In ∆ ABC, D, E and F are respectively\nthe mid-points of sides AB, BC and CA\n(see Fig. 8.18). Show that ∆ ABC is divided into four\ncongruent triangles by joining D, E and F .\nSolution :  As D and E are mid-points of sides AB\nand BC of the triangle ABC, by Theorem 8.8,\nDE || AC\nSimilarly , DF || BC and EF || ABFig. 8.16\nFig. 8.17\nFig. 8.18\nReprint 2025-26\n\nQUADRILA TERALS 113\nTherefore ADEF , BDFE and DFCE are all parallelograms.\nNow DE is a diagonal of the parallelogram BDFE,\ntherefore, ∆ BDE ≅∆ FED\nSimilarly ∆ DAF ≅∆ FED\nand ∆ EFC ≅∆ FED\nSo, all the four triangles are congruent.\nExample 7 :  l, m and n are three parallel lines\nintersected by transversals p and q such that l, m\nand n cut of f equal intercepts AB and BC on p\n(see Fig. 8.19).  Show that l, m and n cut off equal\nintercepts DE and EF on q also.\nSolution :  We are given that AB = BC and have\nto prove that DE = EF .\nLet us join A to F intersecting m at G..\nThe trapezium ACFD is divided into two triangles;\nnamely ∆ ACF and ∆ AFD.\nIn ∆ ACF, it is given that B is the mid-point of AC (AB = BC)\nand BG || CF (since m || n).\nSo, G is the mid-point of AF (by using Theorem 8.9)\nNow , in ∆ AFD, we can apply the same ar gument as G is the mid-point of AF,\nGE || AD and so by Theorem 8.9, E is the mid-point of DF ,\ni.e., DE = EF .\nIn other words, l, m and n cut off equal intercepts on q also.\nEXERCISE 8.2\n1.ABCD is a quadrilateral in which P , Q, R and S are\nmid-points of the sides AB, BC, CD and DA\n(see Fig 8.20).
