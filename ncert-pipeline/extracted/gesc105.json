      "content": "Chapter 4, magnesium hydroxide is a base.\nSo, magnesium oxide is a new substance\nformed on burning of magnesium.Magnesium hydroxide is another newThe equations here are different from\nthose in mathematics. In equations\nof this kind, the arrow implies‘becomes’. No attempt should be made\nto balance chemical equations at this\nstage.\nReprint 2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 50\nsubstance formed by mixing magnesium\noxide with water.\nActivity 5.7\n(To be demonstrated by the teacher)Dissolve about a teaspoonful of copper\nsulphate (blue vitriol or neela thotha ) in\nabout half a cup of water in a glass\ntumbler or a beaker. Add a few drops of\ndilute sulphuric acid to the solution.\nYou should get a blue coloured solution.Save a small sample of the solution in a\ntest tube or a small glass bottle. Drop a\nnail or a used shaving blade into theremaining solution. Wait for half an\nhour or so. Observe the colour of the\nsolution. Compare it with the colour ofthe sample solution saved separately\n(Fig. 5.4).colour of the solution from blue to\ngreen is due to the formation of ironsulphate, a new substance. The brown\ndeposit on the iron nail is copper,\nanother new substance. We can writethe reaction as:\nCopper sulphate solution (blue) + Iron\n Iron sulphate solution (green)\n+ Copper (brown deposit)\nActivity 5.8\nTake about a teaspoonful of vinegar in\na test tube. Add a pinch of baking soda\nto it. You would hear a hissing soundand see bubbles of a gas coming out.\nPass this gas through freshly prepared\nlime water as shown in Fig. 5.5.\nWhat happens to the lime water?\nDo you see any change in the colour\nof the solution?\nTake out the nail or the blade.Has it changed in any way?\nThe changes that you notice are\ndue to a reaction between copper\nsulphate and iron. The change ofThe change in the test tube is as\nfollows:\nVinegar (Acetic acid) + Baking soda\n(Sodium hydrogencarbonate) \nCarbon dioxide + other substances\nThe reaction between carbon dioxide\nand lime water is as follows:Fig. 5.4   Change in colour of the copper sulphate\nsolution due to reaction with ironCopper sulphate\n(blue)Iron sulphate (greenish)\nReprint 2024-25\n\nPHYSICAL  AND CHEMICAL  CHANGES 51Carbon dioxide (CO2) + Lime water\n[Ca(OH)2] Calcium Carbonate\n(CaCO3) + Water (H2O)\nWhen carbon dioxide is passed\nthrough lime water, calcium carbonate\nis formed, which makes lime water milky.\nThe turning of lime water  into milky is a\nstandard test of carbon dioxide. You will\nuse it in Chapter 6 to show that the air\nwe breathe out is rich in carbon dioxide.\nIn Activities 5.6–5.8, you saw that\nin each change one or more newsubstances were formed. In Activity 5.6,the ash was the new substance formed\nwhen magnesium was burnt in air. In\nActivity 5.7, the reaction of copper\nsulphate with iron produced iron\nsulphate and copper.  Both of these are\nnew substances. Copper was depositedon the shaving blade of iron. In Activity\n5.8, vinegar and baking soda together\nproduced carbon dioxide, which turnedlime water milky. Can you name the new\nsubstance formed in this reaction?A change in which one or more\nnew substances are formed is called a\nchemical change . A chemical change\nis also called a chemical reaction .\nChemical changes are very important\nin our lives.  All new substances are\nformed as a result of chemical changes.\nFor example, digestion of food in ourbody, ripening of fruits, fermentation of\ngrapes, etc., happen due to series of\nchemical changes. A medicine is the endproduct of a chain of chemical reactions.\nUseful new materials, such as plastics\nand detergents, are produced bychemical reactions. Indeed, every new\nmaterial is discovered by studying\nchemical changes.\nWe have seen that one or more new\nsubstances are produced in a chemicalchange.  In addition to new products,the following may accompany a chemical\nchange:\nHeat, light or any other radiation\n(ultraviolet, for example) may be given\noff or absorbed.\nSound may be produced.\nA change in smell may take place or\na new smell may be given off.\nA colour change may take place .\nA gas may be formed.\nLet us look at some examples.You saw that burning of magnesium\nribbon is a chemical change.  Burningof coal, wood or leaves is also a chemicalchange. In fact, burning of any\nsubstance is a chemical change.\nBurning is always accompanied byproduction of heat.Fig. 5.5  Set up to pass gas through lime water\nVinegar +\nBaking sodaCarbondioxide\nLimewater\nReprint 2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 52Explosion of a firework is a chemical\nchange. You know that such an\nexplosion produces heat, light, sound\nand unpleasant gases that pollute the\natmosphere. That is why you are advisednot to play with fireworks.\nWhen food gets spoiled, it produces\na foul smell. Shall we call this change achemical change?\nYou must have noticed that a slice of\nan apple acquires a brown colour if it isnot consumed immediately. If you have\nnot seen this change in colour, cut a\nfresh slice of apple and keep it away forsome time. Repeat the same activity with\na slice of potato or brinjal. The change\nof colour in these cases is due to theformation of new substances. Are not\nthese changes chemical changes?\nIn Chapter 4, you neutralised an acid\nwith a base.  Is neutralisation a chemicalchange?5.3 R USTING  OF IRON\nLet us get back to rusting. This is onechange that affects iron articles and\nslowly destroys them. Since iron is usedin making bridges, ships, cars, truck\nbodies and many other articles, the\nmonetary loss due to rusting is huge.\nThe process of rusting can be\nrepresented by the following equation:\nIron (Fe) + Oxygen (O\n2, from the air)\n+ water (H2O)  rust (iron oxide Fe2O3)\nFor rusting, the presence of both\noxygen and water (or water vapour)is essential.\nIn fact, if the content of moisture in\nair is high, which means if it is morehumid, rusting becomes faster.\nSo, how do we prevent rusting?\nPrevent iron articles from coming incontact with oxygen, or water, or both.\nOne simple way is to apply a coat of\npaint or grease. In fact, these coatsshould be applied regularly to prevent\nrusting. Another way is to deposit a layer\nof a metal like chromium or zinc on iron.A protective shield\nYou must have heard of the ozone layerin our atmosphere. It protects us fromthe harmful ultraviolet radiation which\ncome from the sun. Ozone absorbs this\nradiation and breaks down to oxygen.Oxygen is different from ozone. Can\nwe call the breaking down of ozone a\nchemical change?\nIf ultraviolet radiation were not\nabsorbed by ozone, it would reach theearth’s surface and cause harm to usand other life forms. Ozone acts as a\nnatural shield against this radiation.\nWe learnt in Chapter 1 that\nplants produce their food by\na process called photosynthesis.\nCan we call photosynthesis\na chemical change?\nPaheli said that even digestion\nis a chemical change.\nReprint 2024-25\n\nPHYSICAL  AND CHEMICAL  CHANGES 53\nCopper sulphate\nCrystalsThis process of depositing a layer of zinc\non iron is called galvanisation . The iron\npipes we use in our homes to carry waterare galvanised to prevent rusting.\nYou know that ships are made of iron\nand a part of them remains under water.On the part above water also, waterdrops keep clinging to the ship’s outer\nsurface.
