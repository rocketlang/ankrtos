      "content": "CHAPTER 3 : MONEY AND CREDIT\nMoney is a fascinating subject and full of\ncuriosities. It is important to capture this\nelement for the students. The history of\nmoney and how various forms were used at\ndifferent times is an interesting story. At this\nstage the purpose is to allow students to\nrealise the social situation in which these\nforms were used. Modern forms of money are\nlinked to the banking system. This is the\ncentral idea of the first part of the chapter .\nThe present situation in India, where\nnewer forms of money are slowly spreading\nwith computerisation of the banking system,\noffers many opportunities to students to\nexplore on their own. W e need not get into a\nformal discussion of the ‘functions of money’\nbut let it come up as questions. There are\ncertain areas that are not covered, such as\n‘creation of money’ (money multiplier) or the\nbacking of the modern system that may be\ndiscussed if you desire.\nAs you would se e in the chapter , the stock\nof money consists of currency held by the\npublic and the demand deposits that they hold\nwith the banks. This is the money that people\ncan use as they wish and the government has\nto ensure that the system works smoothy.\nWhat would happen when the government\ndeclares that some of the currency notes used\nby people would be made invalid and would be\nreplaced by new currency? In India, during\nNovember 2016, currency notes in the\ndenomination of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 were\ndeclared invalid. People were asked to\nsurrender these notes to the bank by a specific\nperiod and receive new Rs. 500, Rs. 2,000 or\nother currency notes. This is known as\n‘demonetisation’. Since then, people were also\nencouraged to use their bank deposits rather\nthan cash for transactions. Hence, digital\ntransactions started by using bank-to-bank\ntransfer through the internet or mobile\nphones, cheques, ATM cards, credit cards,\nand Point of Sale (POS) swipe machines at\nshops. This is promoted to reduce the\nrequirement of cash for transactions and also\ncontrol corruption. Students could be asked\nto debate on the process and the impact of\ndemonetisation. They can be guided to makea collage of the major areas where people use\ndigital and cash transactions which are\nlegitimate and legal. They can also discuss the\ntransactions which are legal and why. It is also\nimportant to intimate students that different\ntypes of plastic cards are used in place of cash\ntransactions but not all of them money per se .\nCredit is a crucial element in economic\nlife and it is, therefore, important to first\nunderstand this in a conceptual manner.\nWhat are the aspects that one looks at in\nany credit arrangement and how this affects\npeople is the main focus of the second part\nof the chapter. The world around us offers a\ntremendous variety of such arrangements\nand it would be ideal to explain these\naspects of credit from situations that are\nfamiliar to your students. The other crucial\nissue of credit is its availability to all,\nespecially the poor, and on reasonable\nterms. We need to emphasise that this is a\nright of the people and without which a large\nsection of them would be kept out of the\ndevelopment process. There are many\ninnovative interventions, such as that of\nGrameen Bank, of which students may be\nmade familiar with but it is important to\nrealise that we don’t have answers to all\nquestions. We need to find new ways and\nthis is one of the social challenges that\ndeveloping countries face.\nSources for Information\nThe data on formal and informal sector credit\nused in this chapter is drawn from the\nsurvey on rural debt by the National Sample\nSurvey Organisation (All India Debt and\nInvestment Survey, 77th Round 2019,\nconducted by NSSO) now known as National\nStatistical Office (NSO) . The information and\ndata on Grameen Bank is taken from\nnewspaper reports and websites. In order\nto get the details of bank-related statistics\nor a particular detail of a bank, you can log\non to the websites of the Reserve Bank of\nIndia (www.rbi.org)  and the concerned\nbanks.

Look around\nyou and you would easily be able to\nidentify several transactions involving\nmoney in any single day. Can you\nmake a list of these? In many of these\ntransactions, goods are being bought\nand sold with the use of money. In\nsome of these transactions, services\nare being exchanged with money.  For\nsome, there might not be any actual\ntransfer of money taking place now\nbut a pr omise to pay money later .\nHave you ever wondered why\ntransactions are made in\nmoney? The reason is simple.\nA person holding money can easily\nexchange it for any commodity or\nservice that he or she might want.\nThus everyone  prefers to receive\npayments in money and then\nexchange the money for things that\nthey want.  Take the case of a shoe\nmanufactur er. He wants to sell shoes\nin the market and buy wheat.  The\nshoe manufacturer will first exchange\nshoes that he has produced for\nmoney, and then exchange the money\nfor wheat. Imagine how much moredifficult it would be if the shoe\nmanufacturer had to directly\nexchange shoes for wheat without the\nuse of money. He would have to look\nfor a wheat growing farmer who not\nonly wants to sell wheat\nbut also wants to buy the\nshoes in exchange.\nThat is, both parties\nhave to agree to\nsell and buy each\nothers commodities.\nThis is known as\ndouble coincidence\nof wants.  What a person\ndesires to sell is exactly what the\nother wishes to buy. In a barter\nsystem where goods are directly\nexchanged without the use of money,\ndouble coincidence of wants is an\nessential feature.\nIn contrast, in an economy where\nmoney is in use, money by providing\nthe crucial intermediate step\neliminates the need for double\ncoincidence of wants. It is no longer\nnecessary for the shoe manufacturer\nto look for a farmer who will buy his\nshoes and at the same time sell himMONEY MONEYMONEYMONEYMONEY\nANDANDANDANDAND\nCREDIT\nCREDITCREDIT CREDITCREDITCHAPTER 3\nMONEY AS A MEDIUM OF EX CHANGE\nI’LL GIVE\nYOU SHOES\nFOR YOUR\nWHEA T.I DON’T NEED\nSHOES.

Before\nthe introduction of coins, a variety of\nobjects was used as money. For\nexample, since the very early ages,\nIndians used  grains and cattle as\nmoney. Thereafter came the use of\nmetallic coins — gold, silver , copper\ncoins — a phase which continued well\ninto the last century.\nCurrency\nModern forms of money include\ncurrency — paper notes and coins.\nUnlike the things that were used as\nmoney earlier , moder n curr ency is not\nmade of precious metal such as gold,\nsilver and copper .  And unlike grain\nand cattle, they are neither of\neveryday use. The modern currency\nis without any use of its own.\nThen, why is it accepted as a\nmedium of exchange?  It is accepted\nas a medium of exchange because the\ncurrency is authorised by the\ngovernment of the country.\nIn India, the Reserve Bank of India\nissues currency notes on behalf of the\ncentral government. As per Indian\nlaw, no other individual ororganisation is allowed to issue\ncurrency. Mor eover , the law legalises\nthe use of rupee as a medium of\npayment that cannot be refused in\nsettling transactions in India. No\nindividual in India can legally refuse\na payment made in rupees. Hence,\nthe rupee is widely accepted as a\nmedium of exchange.\nDeposits with Banks\nThe other form in which people hold\nmoney is as deposits with banks. At\na point of time, people need only some\ncurrency  for their day-to-day needs.\nFor instance, workers who receive\ntheir salaries at the end of each month\nhave extra cash at the beginning of\nthe month. What do people do with\nthis extra cash? They deposit it with\nthe banks by opening a bank\naccount in their name. Banks accept\nthe deposits and also pay an amount\nas interest on the deposits. In this way\npeople’s money is safe with the\nbanks and it earns an amount as\ninterest.  People also have the\nprovision to withdraw the money as\nand when they require. Since the\ndeposits in the bank accounts can be\nwithdrawn on demand, these\ndeposits are called demand deposits.\n1. How does the use of money make it easier to exchange things?\n2.

Salim has to make a payment to the leather supplier and writes\na cheque for a specific amount. This means that the shoe manufacturer instructs his\nbank to pay this amount to the leather supplier . The leather supplier takes this cheque,\nand  deposits it in his own account in the bank. The money is transferred from one bank\naccount to another bank account in a couple of days. The transaction is complete without\nany payment of cash.\nThus we see that demand deposits\nshare the essential features of money.\nThe facility of cheques against demand\ndeposits makes it possible to directly\nsettle payments without the use of cash.\nSince demand deposits are accepted\nwidely as a means of payment, along\nwith currency , they constitute money\nin the modern economy.You must remember the r ole that\nthe banks play here. But for the\nbanks, there would be no demand\ndeposits and no payments by\ncheques against these deposits.  The\nmodern forms of money — currency\nand deposits — are closely linked to\nthe working of the modern banking\nsystem.Account number\nCoding used by banks Cheque numberDemand deposits offer another\ninteresting facility. It is this facility\nwhich lends it the essential\ncharacteristics of money (that of a\nmedium of exchange). Y ou would\nhave heard of payments beingmade by cheques instead of cash.\nFor payment through cheque, the\npayer who has an account with the\nbank, makes out a cheque for a\nspecific amount.

What do the banks do with\nthe deposits which they accept from\nthe public? There is an interesting\nmechanism at work here. Banks keep\nonly a small proportion of their\ndeposits as cash with themselves.  For\nexample, banks in India these days\nhold about 5 per cent of their\ndeposits as cash. This is kept as\nprovision to pay the depositors who\nmight come to withdraw money from\nthe bank on any given day. Since, on\nany particular day, only some of its\nmany depositors come to withdraw\ncash, the bank is able to manage with\nthis cash.\nBanks use the major portion of the\ndeposits to extend loans.  There is ahuge demand for loans for various\neconomic activities. W e shall read more\nabout this in the following sections.\nBanks make use of the deposits to\nmeet the loan requirements of the\npeople.  In this way, banks mediate\nbetween those who have surplus\nfunds (the depositors) and those who\nare in need of these funds (the\nborrowers). Banks charge a higher\ninterest rate on loans than what they\noffer on deposits. The difference\nbetween what is charged from\nborrowers and what is paid to\ndepositors is their main source of\nincome.LOAN ACTIVITIES OF BANKS\nPeople make\ndeposits\nPeople make\nwithdrawals and\nget interestPeople take\nloans\nPeople repay\nloans with\ninterestDEPOSITORS BORROWERS1.

To complete\nproduction on time, Salim has to hire a few\nmore workers for stitching and pasting\nwork. He has to purchase the raw\nmaterials. To meet these expenses, Salim\nobtains loans from two sources. First, he\nasks the leather supplier to supply leathernow and pr omises to pay him later .\nSecond, he obtains loan in cash from the\nlarge trader as advance payment for\n1000 pairs of shoes with a promise to\ndeliver the whole order by the end of the\nmonth.\nAt the end of the month, Salim is able to\ndeliver the or der, make a good pr ofit, and\nrepay the money that he had borrowed.\n(2) Swapna’s Problem(2) Swapna’s Problem(2) Swapna’s Problem(2) Swapna’s Problem(2) Swapna’s ProblemTWO DIFFERENT CREDIT SITU ATIONS\nIn this case, Salim obtains credit to meet the working\ncapital needs of production. The credit helps him to meet the\nongoing expenses of production, complete production on time,\nand thereby increase his earnings. Credit therefore plays a\nvital and positive role in this situation.\nSwapna, a small far mer, grows gr oundnut on her thr ee\nacres of land. She takes a loan from the moneylender\nto meet the expenses of cultivation, hoping that her\nharvest would help repay the loan. Midway through\nthe season the crop is hit by pests and the crop\nfails. Though Swapna sprays  her crops with\nexpensive pesticides, it makes little difference.

At the beginning of the cropping\nseason, the trader supplies the farm inputs on\ncredit, which is  to be repaid when the crops\nare ready for harvest.\nBesides the inter est char ge on the loan, the\ntrader also makes the farmers promise to\nsell the crop to him. This way the trader\ncan ensure that the money is repaid\npromptly .

Thus,\nthe cost to the borrower of informal\nloans is much higher .\nHigher cost of borrowing means a\nlarger part of the earnings of the\nborrowers is used to repay the loan.\nHence, borrowers have less income\nleft for themselves (as we saw for\nShyamal in Sonpur). In certain\ncases, the high interest rate f or\nborrowing can mean that the amount\nto be repaid is greater than the\nincome of the borrower . This could\nlead to increasing debt (as we saw for\nRama in Sonpur) and debt trap. Also,\npeople who might wish to start an\nenterprise by borrowing may not do\nso because of the high cost of\nborrowing.\nFor these reasons, banks and\ncooperative societies need to lend\nmore. This would lead to higher in-\ncomes and many  people could then\nborrow cheaply for a variety\nof needs.  They could grow crops,do business, set up small-scale indus-\ntries etc. They could set up new indus-\ntries or trade in goods. Cheap and\naffordable credit is crucial for the\ncountry’s development.\nFormal and Informal Credit:\nWho gets what?\nGraph 2 shows the importance of\nformal and informal sources of credit\nfor people in urban areas.  The people\nare divided into four groups, from poor\nto rich, as shown in the figure. Y ou can\nsee that 54 per cent of the loans taken\nby poor households in the urban areas\nare from informal sources. Compare\nthis with the rich urban households.\nWhat do you find? Only 17 per cent of\ntheir loans are from informal sources,\nwhile 83 per cent are from formal\nsources. A similar pattern is also found\nin rural areas. The rich households are\navailing cheap credit from formal\nlenders whereas the poor households\nhave to pay a large amount for\nborrowing.\nWhat does all this suggest? First,\nthe formal sector still meets only about\nhalf of the total credit needs of the\nrural people. The remaining credit\nneeds are met from informal sources.\nPoor Households    Well-off       Rich\nHouseholds with a few assets     Households       Households\nBLUE : Per cent of loans from the FORMAL sector\nORANGE: Per cent of loans from the INFORMAL sectorGraph 2 : Of all the loans taken by urban households, what\npercentage was formal and what percentage was informal?\nReprint 2025-26\nReprint 2025-26\n\n50 5050 5050 U UUUUNDERST NDERSTNDERST NDERSTNDERST ANDINGANDINGANDING ANDINGANDING  E  E E  E ECONOMICCONOMICCONOMICCONOMICCONOMIC  D  D D  D DEVEL EVELEVEL EVELEVEL OPMENT OPMENTOPMENT OPMENTOPMENTMost loans from informal lenders\ncarry a very high interest rate and do\nlittle to increase the income of the\nborrowers. Thus,  it is necessary\nthat banks and cooperatives\nincrease their lending particularly\nin the rural areas, so that the\ndependence on informal sources\nof credit reduces.\n1.What are the differences between formal and informal sources of credit?\n2.Why should credit at reasonable rates be available for all?\n3.Should there be a supervisor , such as the Reserve Bank of India, that looks into the\nloan activities of informal lenders? Why would its task be quite difficult?\n4.Why do you think that the share of formal sector credit is higher for the richer households\ncompared to the poorer households?LET’S WORK THESE OUT\nSELF-HELP GROUPS FOR THE POORSecond ly, while formal sector\nloans need to expand, it is also\nnecessary that everyone receives\nthese loans. At present, it is the richer\nhouseholds who receive formal credit\nwhereas the poor have to depend on\nthe informal sources. It is important\nthat the formal credit is distributed\nmore equally so that the poor can\nbenefit from the cheaper loans.\nIn the previous section we have seen\nthat poor households are still\ndependent on informal sources of\ncredit. Why is it so? Banks are not\npresent everywhere in rural India.\nEven when they are present, getting a\nloan from a bank is much more\ndifficult than taking a loan from\ninformal sources. As we saw for\nMegha, bank loans require properdocuments and collateral. Absence of\ncollateral is one of the major reasons\nwhich prevents the poor from getting\nbank loans. Informal lenders such as\nmoneylenders, on the other hand,\nknow the borrowers personally and\nhence are often willing to give a\nloan without collateral. The borrowers\ncan, if necessary, approach the\nmoneylenders even without repaying\nA worker\nstitching a quilt\nDO YOU THINK A BANK\nWILL GIVE ME A\nLOAN?\nReprint 2025-26\nReprint 2025-26\n\nM MM MMONEY ONEYONEYONEYONEY      AND ANDAND ANDAND C  C C  C CREDIT REDITREDIT REDITREDIT 51 5151 5151their earlier loans. However , the\nmoneylenders charge very high rates\nof interest, keep no records of the\ntransactions and harass the poor\nborrowers.\nIn recent years, people have tried\nout some newer ways of providing\nloans to the poor . The idea is to\norganise rural poor , in particular\nwomen, into small Self Help Groups\n(SHGs) and pool (collect) their\nsavings. A typical SHG has 15-20\nmembers, usually belonging to one\nneighbourhood, who meet and save\nregularly. Saving per member varies\nfrom Rs 25 to Rs 100 or more,\ndepending on the ability of the people\nto save. Members can take small loans\nfrom the group itself to meet their\nneeds. The group charges interest on\nthese loans but this is still less than\nwhat the moneylender charges. After\na year or two, if the group is regular\nin savings, it becomes eligible for\navailing loan from the bank.\nLoan is sanctioned in the\nname of the group and is\nmeant to create self-\nemployment opportunities\nfor the members. For\ninstance, small loans are\nprovided to the members for\nreleasing mortgaged land,\nfor meeting working capital\nneeds (e.g. buying seeds,\nfertilisers, raw materials\nlike bamboo and cloth), for\nhousing materials, for\nacquiring assets like sewing\nmachine, handlooms, cattle,\netc.\nMost of the important\ndecisions regarding the\nsavings and loan activities\nare taken by the group\nmembers. The group\ndecides as regards the loansto be granted — the purpose, amount,\ninterest to be charged, repayment\nschedule etc.  Also, it is the group\nwhich is responsible for the repayment\nof the loan. Any case of non-\nrepayment of loan by any one\nmember is followed up seriously by\nother members in the group. Because\nof this feature, banks are willing to\nlend to the poor women when\norganised in SHGs, even though they\nhave no collateral as such.\nThus, the SHGs help borrowers\novercome the problem of lack of\ncollateral. They can get timely loans\nfor a variety of purposes and at a\nreasonable inter est rate. Mor eover ,\nSHGs are the building blocks of\norganisation of the rural poor . Not\nonly does it help women to become\nfinancially self-reliant, the regular\nmeetings of the group provide a\nplatform to discuss and act on a\nvariety of social issues such as health,\nnutrition, domestic violence, etc.\nA women’s self-help group\nmeeting in Gujarat\nReprint 2025-26\nReprint 2025-26\n\nIn this chapter we have looked at the\nmodern forms of money and how they\nare linked with the banking system.\nOn one side are the depositors who\nkeep their money in the banks and on\nthe other side are the borrowers who\ntake loans from these banks. Economic\nactivities require loans or credit. Credit,\nas we saw can have a positive impact,\nor in certain situations make the\nborrower worse off.\nCredit is available from a variety of\nsources. These can be either formal\nsources or informal sources.

At\npresent, it is the richer households\nwho receive credit from formal sources\nwhereas the poor have to depend on\nthe informal sources. It is essential\nthat the total formal sector credit\nincreases so that the dependence on\nthe more expensive informal credit\nbecomes less. Also, the poor should\nget a much greater share of formal\nloans from banks, cooperative\nsocieties etc. Both these steps are\nimportant for development.Grameen Bank of Bangladesh is one of the\nbiggest success stories in reaching the poor to\nmeet their credit needs at reasonable rates.\nStarted in the 1970s as a small project,\nGrameen Bank in 2018  had over 9 million\nmembers in about 81, 600 villages spread\nacross Bangladesh. Almost all of the borrowers\nare women and belong to poorest sections of\nthe society. These borrowers have proved that\nnot only are poor women reliable borrowers, but\nthat they can start and run a variety of small\nincome-generating activities successfully.\nEXERCISES\n1.In situations with high risks, credit might create further problems for the borrower .\nExplain.\n2.How does money solve the problem of double coincidence of wants?
