CharcoalFig. 4.9 : Flames of kerosene lamp, candle and\nBunsen burner\nFig. 4.8: Colours of a candle flame and the\nflame of a kitchen stove\n Record your observations and\nmention whether on burning the\nmaterial forms a flame or not.\n2024-25\n\nCOMBUSTION  AND FLAME 47\n4.5Structure of a Flame\nActivity  4.5\nLight a candle (Caution : Be careful).\nHold a 4 -5 cm long thin glass tube\nwith a pair of tongs and introduce\nits one end in the dark zone of a\nnon-flickering candle flame\n(Fig. 4.10). Bring a lighted\nmatchstick near the other end of the\nglass tube. Do you see a flame\ncaught at this end of the glass tube\nafter a while? If so, what is it that\nproduces a flame? Notice that the wax\nnear the heated wick melts quickly.\nThe substances which vapourise\nduring burning, give flames. For\nexample, kerosene oil and molten wax\nrise through the wick and are vapourised\nduring burning and form flames.\nCharcoal, on the other hand, does not\nvapourise and so does not produce a\nflame. In Activity 4.5, could the vapours\nof wax coming out of the glass tube be\nthe cause of the flame produced?\nFig. 4.10\nFig. 4.12When the candle flame is steady,\nintroduce a clean glass plate/slide into\nthe luminous zone of the flame\n(Fig. 4.11). Hold it there with a pair of\ntongs for about 10 seconds. Then\nremove it. What do you observe?Fig. 4.11\nA circular blackish ring is formed on\nthe glass plate/slide. It indicates the\ndeposition of unburnt carbon particles\npresent in the luminous zone of the\nflame.\nHold a thin long copper wire just\ninside the non-luminous zone of flame\nfor about 30 seconds (Fig. 4.12).\nNotice that the portion of the copper\nwire just outside the flame gets red hot.\nDoes it indicate that the non-luminous\nzone of the flame has a high\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 48\nFig. 4.14 : Goldsmith blowing through a\nmetallic pipe4.6What is a Fuel?\nRecall that the sources of heat energy\nfor domestic and industrial purposes\nare mainly wood, charcoal, petrol,\nkerosene etc. These substances are\ncalled fuels. A good fuel is one which is\nreadily available. It is cheap. It burns\neasily in air at a moderate rate. It\nproduces a large amount of heat. It does\nnot leave behind any undersirable\nsubstances.\nThere is probably no fuel that could\nbe consider ed as an ideal fuel . We\nshould look for a fuel which fulfils most\nof the requirements for a particular use.\nFuels differ in their cost. Some fuels\nare cheaper than others.\nMake a list of fuels familiar to you.\nGroup them as solid, liquid and gaseous\nfuels as in Table 4.3.\n4.7Fuel Efficiency\nSuppose you were asked to boil a given\nquantity of water using cow dung, coal\nand LPG as fuel. Which fuel would you\nprefer? Give your r\neason. Y ou may take\nthe help of your parents. Do these three\nfuels produce the same amount of heat?\nThe amount of heat energy produced on\ncomplete combustion of 1 kg of a fuel is\ncalled its calorific value. The calorific\nvalue of a fuel is expressed in a unitFig. 4.13 : Different zones of candle flame\nTable 4.3 : Types of Fuels\n S. No. Solid Fuels Liquid Fuels Gaseous Fuels\n1.

In fact, this part of the\nflame is the hottest part (Fig. 4.13).\nGoldsmiths blow the outermost zone\nof a flame with a metallic blow-pipe for\nmelting gold and silver (Fig. 4.14). Why\ndo they use the outermost zone of the\nflame?\n2024-25\n\nCOMBUSTION  AND FLAME 49\nparticles. These fine particles are\ndangerous pollutants causing\nrespiratory diseases, such as asthma.\n2.Incomplete combustion of these\nfuels gives carbon monoxide gas. It is a\nvery poisonous gas. It is dangerous to\nburn coal in a closed room. The carbon\nmonoxide gas produced can kill persons\nsleeping in that room.\nFor centuries, wood was used as\ndomestic and industrial fuel. But now\nit has been replaced by coal and other\nfuels like LPG. In many rural parts of\nour country, people still use wood as a\nfuel because of its easy availability and\nlow cost. However , burning of wood gives\na lot of smoke which is very harmful for\nhuman beings. It causes respiratory\nproblem. Also, trees provide us with\nuseful substances which are lost when\nwood is used as fuel. Moreover cutting\nof trees leads to deforestation  which is\nquite harmful to the environment, as\nyou learnt in Class VII.Table 4.4 : Calorific V alues of dif ferent\nFuels\nFuel Calorific V alue\n(kJ/kg)\nCow dung cake 6000-8000\nWood 17000-22000\nCoal 25000-33000\nPetrol 45000\nKerosene 45000\nDiesel 45000\nMethane 50000\nCNG 50000\nLPG 55000\nBiogas 35000-40000\nHydrogen 150000\nOh! So, that is why we are\nadvised never to sleep in a\nroom with burning or\nsmouldering coal fire in it.\nBurning of Fuels Leads to Harmful\nProducts\nThe increasing fuel consumption has\nharmful effects on the environment.\n1.Carbon fuels like wood, coal,\npetroleum release unburnt carbon3.Combustion of most fuels releases\ncarbon dioxide in the environment.\nIncreased concentration of carbon\ndioxide in the air is believed to cause\nglobal warming .\nGlobal warming is the rise in\ntemperature of the atmosphere  of the\nearth. This results , among other things,\nin the melting of polar glaciers , which\nleads to a rise in the sea level, causing\nfloods in the coastal areas . Low lying\ncoastal areas may even be permanently\nsubmer ged under water .\n4.Burning of coal and diesel releases\nsulphur dioxide gas. It is an extremely\nsuffocating and corr osive gas. Mor eover ,\npetrol engines give off  gaseous oxides\nof nitrogen. Oxides of sulphur and\nnitrogen dissolve in rain water and form\nacids. Such rain is called acid rain . It is\nvery harmful for crops, buildings\nand soil.\nThe use of diesel and petrol as fuels\nin automobiles is being replaced by\nCNG (Compressed Natural Gas), because\nCNG produces the harmful  products in\nvery small amounts. CNG is a cleaner fuel.called  kilojoule per kg  (kJ/kg).\nCalorific values of some fuels are given\nin Table 4.4.\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 50\n KEYWORDS KEYWORDS KEYWORDS KEYWORDS KEYWORDS\nACID RAIN\nCALORIFIC V ALUE\nCOMBUSTION\nDEFOREST ATION\nEXPLOSION\nFLAME\nFIRE EXTINGUISHER\nFUEL\nFUEL EFFICIENCY\nGLOBAL WARMING\nIDEAL FUEL\nIGNITION\nTEMPERA TURE\nINFLAMMABLE\nSUBST ANCES WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT\nÜThe substances which burn in air are called\ncombustible.\nÜOxygen (in air) is essential for combustion.\nÜDuring the process of combustion, heat and\nlight are given out.\nÜIgnition temperature is the lowest temperature\nat which a combustible substance catches\nfire.\nÜInflammable substances have very low\nignition temperature.\nÜFire can be controlled by removing one or more\nrequirements essential for producing fire.\nÜWater is commonly used to contr ol fires.\nÜWater cannot be used to contr ol fires involving\nelectrical equipment or oils.\nÜThere are various types of combustions such\nas rapid combustion, spontaneous\ncombustion, explosion, etc.\nÜThere are three different zones of a flame -\ndark zone, luminous zone and non-luminous\nzone.\nÜAn ideal fuel is cheap, readily available, readily\ncombustible and easy to transport.
