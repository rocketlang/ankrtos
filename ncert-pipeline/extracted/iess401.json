We\nmust not accept something just because it is\nfamous, just because everyone accepts it.\nYolanda : Ma’am, can I suggest something? W e don’t\nneed to look for any definition. I read somewhere\nthat the word democracy comes from a Greek\nword ‘Demokratia’. In Greek ‘demos’ means\npeople and ‘kratia’ means rule. So democracy is\nrule by the people. This is the correct meaning.\nWhere is the need to debate?\nLyngdoh Madam : That is also a very helpful way\nof thinking about this matter . I would just say\nthat this does not always work. A word does not\nremain tied to its origin. Just think of computers.\nOriginally they were used for computing, that is to\nsay calculating, very difficult mathematical sums.\nThese were ver y power ful calculators. But nowa-\ndays very few people use computers for comput-\ning sums. They use it for writing, for designing, for\nlistening to music and for watching films. Words\nremain the same but their meaning can change\nwith time. In that case it is not very useful to look\nat the origins of a word.\nMerry : Ma’am, so basically what you are saying\nis that there is no shortcut to our thinking about\nthe matter ourselves. We have to think about its\nmeaning and evolve a definition.\nLyngdoh Madam : You got me right. Let us get on\nwith it now .\nACTIVITY\nLet us take Lyngdoh Madam seriously and try to\nwrite down the exact definition of some of the\nsimple words that we use all the time: pen, rain\nand love. For example, is there a way of defining a\npen that distinguishes it clearly from a pencil, a\nbrush, a chalk or crayon.\n/UIstopWhat have you learnt from this attempt?\n/UIstopWhat does it teach us about understanding the\nmeaning of democracy?\nA simple definitionA simple definitionA simple definitionA simple definitionA simple definition\nLet us get back to our discussion on\nsimilarities and differences among\ngovernments that are calledYou have already read about different\nforms of government.

She does not like this way\nof defining democracy and wants\nto ask some basic questions.\nHer teacher Matilda Lyngdoh\nresponds to her questions, as other\nclassmates join the discussion:\nMerry : Ma’am, I don’t like this idea. First we spend\ntime discussing democracy and then we want\nto find out the meaning of democracy . I mean\nlogically shouldn’t we have approached it the\nother way round? Shouldn’t the meaning have\ncome first and then the example?\nLyngdoh Madam: I can see your point. But that is\nnot how we reason in everyday life. We use\nwords like pen, rain or love. Do we wait to have\na definition of these words before we use them?\nCome to think of it, do we have clear definition\nof these words? It is only by using a word that\nwe understand its meaning.\nMerry : But then why do we need definitions at all?\nLyngdoh Madam : We need a definition only when\nwe come across a difficulty in the use of a word.\nWe need a definition of rain only when we wish to\ndistinguish it from, say , drizzle or cloudburst. The\nsame is tr ue for democracy . We need a clear\ndefinition only because people use it for different\npurposes, because very different kinds of gov-\nernments call themselves democracy .\nRibiang : But why do we need to work on a defini-\ntion? The other day you quoted Abraham\nLincoln to us: “Democracy is government of\nthe people, by the people and for the people”.\nWe in Meghalaya always ruled ourselves. That\nis accepted by everyone. Why do we need to\nchange that?\nLyngdoh Madam : I am not saying we need to\nchange it. I too find this definition very beautiful.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n",

This time she\ndid not mention the names of the people who said or wrote these. She wants you to read these and\ncomment on how good or useful these thoughts are:\n<Democracy gives ever y man the right to be his own oppressor .\n<Democracy consists of choosing your dictators after they’ve told you what you think it is you want\nto hear .\n<Man’s capacity for justice makes democracy possible, but man’s inclination to injustice makes\ndemocracy necessary\n<Democracy is a device that insures we shall be governed no better than we deserve.\n<All the ills of democracy can be cured by more democracy .democracies. One simple factor\ncommon to all democracies is: the\ngovernment is chosen by the people.\nWe could thus start with a simple\ndefinition: democracy is a form of\ngovernment in which the rulers are\nelected by the people.\nThis is a useful starting point. This\ndefinition allows us to separate\ndemocracy from forms of government\nthat are clearly not democratic. The\narmy rulers of Myanmar were not\nelected by the people. Those who\nhappened to be in control of the army\nbecame the rulers of the country.\nPeople had no say in this decision.\nDictators like Pinochet (Chile) are not\nelected by the people. This also\napplies to monarchies. The kings of\nSaudi Arabia rule not because the\npeople have chosen them to do so butbecause they happen to be born into\nthe royal family.\nThis simple definition is not\nadequate. It reminds us that\ndemocracy is people’s rule. But if we\nuse this definition in an unthinking\nmanner, we would end up calling\nalmost every government that holds\nan election a democracy. That would\nbe very misleading. As we shall find\nout in Chapter 3, every government\nin contemporary world wants to be\ncalled a democracy, even if it is not\nso. That is why we need to carefully\ndistinguish between a government\nthat is a democracy and one that\npretends to be one. We can do so by\nunderstanding each word in this\ndefinition carefully and spelling out\nthe features of a democratic\ngovernment.\nThis car toon was\ndrawn when elections\nwere held in Iraq with\nthe presence of US\nand other foreign\npowers.

In August\n2002 he issued a ‘Legal Framework\nOrder’ that amended the\nConstitution of Pakistan. According\nto this Order, the President can\ndismiss the national and provincial\nassemblies. The work of the civilian\ncabinet is supervised by a National\nSecurity Council which is\ndominated by military officers. After\npassing this law, elections were\nheld to the national and provincial\nassemblies. So Pakistan has had\nelections, elected representatives\nhave some powers. But the final\npower rested with military officers\nand General Musharraf himself.\nClearly, there are many reasons\nwhy Pakistan under General\nMusharraf should not be called a\ndemocracy. But let us focus on one\nof these. Can we say that the rulers\nare elected by the people in\nPakistan? Not quite. People may\nhave elected their representatives to\nthe national and provincial\nassemblies but those elected\nrepresentatives were not really therulers. They cannot take the final\ndecisions. The power to take final\ndecision rested with army officials\nand with General Musharraf, and\nnone of them were elected by the\npeople. This happens in many\ndictatorships and monarchies. They\nformally have an elected parliament\nand government but the real power\nis with those who are not elected.\nIn a few countries, the real power\nwas with some external powers and\nnot with locally elected\nrepresentatives. This cannot be\ncalled people’s rule.\nThis gives us the first feature.

Opposition\nparties did contest elections, but\nnever managed to win. The PRI was\nknown to use many dirty tricks to\nwin elections. All those who were\nemployed in government offices\nhad to attend its party meetings.\nTeachers of government schools\nused to force parents to vote for the\nPRI. Media largely ignored the\nactivities of opposition political\nparties except to criticise them.\nSometimes the polling booths were\nshifted from one place to another in\nthe last minute, which made it\ndifficult for people to cast their votes.\nThe PRI spent a large sum of money\nin the campaign for its candidates.\nShould we consider the elections\ndescribed above as examples of\npeople electing their rulers? Reading\nthese examples we get a sense that\nwe cannot. There are many problems\nhere. In China the elections do not\noffer the people any serious choice.\nThey have to choose the ruling party\nand the candidates approved by it.\nCan we call this a choice? In the\nMexican example, people seemed to\nreally have a choice but in practice\nthey had no choice. There was no\nway the ruling party could be\ndefeated, even if people were against\nit. These are not fair elections.\nWe can thus add a second feature\nto our understanding of democracy.\nHolding elections of any kind is not\nsufficient. The elections must offer\na real choice between political\nalternatives. And it should be\npossible for people to use this choice\nto remove the existing rulers, if they\nwish so. So, a democracy must be\nbased on a free and fair election\nwhere those currently in power\nhave a fair chance of losing.

That gives us the third\nfeature of democracy: in a\ndemocracy, each adult citizen must\nhave one vote and each vote must\nhave one value .

Its leader,\nRobert Mugabe, ruled the country\nsince independence. Elections were\nheld regularly and always won by\nZANU-PF. President Mugabe was\npopular but also used unfair practices\nin elections. Over the years his\ngovernment changed the constitution\nseveral times to increase the powers\nof the President and make him less\naccountable. Opposition party\nworkers were harassed and their\nmeeting disrupted. Public protests\nand demonstrations against the\ngovernment were declared illegal.\nThere was a law that limited the right\nto criticise the President. Television\nand radio were controlled by the\ngovernment and gave  only the\nruling party’s version. There were\nindependent newspapers but thegovernment harasse d those\njournalists who went against it. The\ngovernment ignored some court\njudgments that went against it and\npressurised judges.  He was forced\nout of office in 2017.\nThe example of Zimbabwe shows\nthat popular approval of the rulers is\nnecessary in a democracy, but it is\nnot sufficient. Popular governments\ncan be undemocratic. Popular leaders\ncan be autocratic. If we wish to assess\na democracy, it is important to look\nat the elections. But it is equally\nimportant to look before and after the\nelections. There should be sufficient\nroom for normal political activity,\nincluding political opposition, in the\nperiod before elections. This requires\nthat the state should respect some\nbasic rights of the citizen.

The existence of\ndemocracy in India made the\nIndian government respond to food\nscarcity in a way that the Chinese\ngovernment did not. They point out\nthat no large-scale famine has ever\ntaken place in an independent and\ndemocratic country. If China too had\nmultiparty elections, an opposition\nparty and a press free to criticise the\ngovernment, then so many people\nmay not have died in the famine.\nThis example brings out one of the\nreasons why democracy is considered\nthe best form of government.\nDemocracy is better than any other\nform of government in responding to\nthe needs of the people. A non-\ndemocratic government may and can\nrespond to the people’s needs, but it\nall depends on the wishes of the\npeople who rule. If the rulers don’t\nwant to, they don’t have to act\naccording to the wishes of the people.\nA democracy requires that the rulers\nhave to attend to the needs of the\npeople. A democratic government is\na better government because it is a\nmore accountable form of\ngovernment .\nThere is another reason why\ndemocracy should lead to better\ndecisions than any non-democratic\ngovernment. Democracy is based on\nconsultation and discussion. A\ndemocratic decision always involves\nmany persons, discussions and\nmeetings. When a number of people\nput their heads together, they are\nable to point out possible mistakes\nin any decision. This takes time. But\nthere is a big advantage in taking\ntime over important decisions. This\nreduces the chances of rash or\nirresponsible decisions. Thus\ndemocracy improves the quality\nof decision-making.This is related to the third\nargument. Democracy provides a\nmethod to deal with differences\nand conflicts. In any society people\nare bound to have differences of\nopinions and interests. These\ndifferences are particularly sharp in\na country like ours which has an\namazing social diversity. People\nbelong to different regions, speak\ndifferent languages, practise\ndifferent religions and have different\ncastes. They look at the world very\ndifferently and have different\npreferences. The preferences of one\ngroup can clash with those of other\ngroups. How do we resolve such a\nconflict? The conflict can be solved\nby brutal power. Whichever group\nis more powerful will dictate its\nterms and others will have to accept\nthat. But that would lead to\nresentment and unhappiness.\nDifferent groups may not be able to\nlive together for long in such a way.\nDemocracy provides the only\npeaceful solution to this problem. In\ndemocracy, no one is a permanent\nwinner. No one is a permanent loser.\nDifferent groups can live with one\nanother peacefully. In a diverse\ncountry like India, democracy keeps\nour country together.\nThese three arguments were about\nthe effects of democracy on the\nquality of government and social life.\nBut the strongest argument for\ndemocracy is not about what\ndemocracy does to the government.\nIt is about what democracy does to\nthe citizens. Even if democracy does\nnot bring about better decisions and\naccountable government, it is still\nbetter than other forms of\ngovernment. Democracy enhances\nthe dignity of citizens .

People are not subjects of\na ruler, they are the rulers\nthemselves. Even when they make\nmistakes, they are responsible for\ntheir conduct.\nFinally, democracy is better than\nother forms of government because\nit allows us to correct its own\nmistakes . As we saw above, there is\nno guarantee that mistakes cannot\nbe made in democracy. No form of\ngovernment can guarantee that. The\nadvantage in a democracy is that\nsuch mistakes cannot be hidden for\nlong. There is a space for public\ndiscussion on these mistakes. And\nthere is a room for correction. Eitherthe rulers have to change their\ndecisions, or the rulers can be\nchanged. This cannot happen in a\nnon-democratic government.\nLet us sum it up. Democracy\ncannot get us everything and is not\nthe solution to all problems. But it\nis clearly better than any other\nalternative that we know. It offers\nbetter chances of a good decision,\nit is likely to respect people’s own\nwishes and allows different kinds of\npeople to live together. Even when\nit fails to do some of these things, it\nallows a way of correcting its\nmistakes and offers more dignity to\nall citizens. That is why democracy\nis considered the best form of\ngovernment.This car toon was\npublished in Canada\njust before its\nparliamentar y\nelections of 2004.\nEveryone, including\nthe car toonist,\nexpected the Liberal\nparty to win once\nagain.

We\nhave understood democracy as a\nform of government. This way of\ndefining democracy helps us to\nidentify a clear set of minimal\nfeatures that a democracy must\nhave. The most common form that\ndemocracy takes in our times is that\nof a representative democracy. You\nhave already read about this in the\nprevious classes. In the countries we\ncall democracy, all the people do not\nrule. A majority is allowed to take\ndecisions on behalf of all the people.\nEven the majority does not rule\ndirectly. The majority of people rulethrough their elected representatives.\nThis become necessary because:\n/UIstopModern democracies involve such\na large number of people that it is\nphysically impossible for them to\nsit together and take a collective\ndecision.\n/UIstopEven if they could, the citizen does\nnot have the time, the desire or the\nskills to take part in all the\ndecisions.\nThis gives us a clear but minimal\nunderstanding of democracy. This\nclarity helps us to distinguish\ndemocracies from non-democracies.\nBut it does not allow us to\ndistinguish between a democracy\nand a good democracy. It does not\nWHAT IS DEMOCRAC Y?

Laxman, The Times of India\nReprint 2025-26\n\n14 DEMOCRA TIC POLITICS\nallow us to see the operation of\ndemocracy beyond government. For\nthis we need to turn to broader\nmeanings of democracy.\nSometimes we use democracy for\norganisations other than the\ngovernment. Just read these\nstatements:\n/UIstop“We are a very democratic family.\nWhenever a decision has to be taken,\nwe all sit down and arrive at a\nconsensus. My opinion matters as much\nas my father’s .”\n/UIstop“I don’t like teachers who do not allow\nstudents to speak and ask questions in\nthe class. I would like to have teachers\nwith democratic temperament. ”\n/UIstop“One leader and his family members\ndecide everything in this party. How can\nthey talk of democracy? ”\nThese ways of using the word\ndemocracy go back to its basic\nsense of a method of taking\ndecisions. A democratic decision\ninvolves consultation with and\nconsent of all those who are affected\nby that decision. Those who are not\npowerful have the same say in\ntaking the decision as those who are\npowerful. This can apply to a\ngovernment or a family or any other\norganisation. Thus democracy is\nalso a principle that can be applied\nto any sphere of life.\nSometimes we use the word\ndemocracy not to describe any\nexisting government but to set up\nan ideal standard that all\ndemocracies must aim to become:\n/UIstop“True democracy will come to this\ncountry only when no one goes hungry\nto bed. ”\n/UIstop“In a democracy every citizen must be\nable to play equal role in decision\nmaking. For this you don’t need just an\nequal right to vote. Every citizen needs\nto have equal information, basic\neducation, equal resources and a lot of\ncommitment. ”If we take these ideals seriously,\nthen no country in the world is a\ndemocracy. Yet an understanding of\ndemocracy as an ideal reminds us\nof why we value democracy. It\nenables us to judge an existing\ndemocracy and identify its\nweaknesses. It helps us to\ndistinguish between a minimal\ndemocracy and a good democracy.\nIn this book we do not deal much\nwith this expanded notion of\ndemocracy. Our focus here is with\nsome core institutional features of\ndemocracy as a form of government.\nNext year you will read more about\na democratic society and ways of\nevaluating our democracy. At this\nstage we just need to note that\ndemocracy can apply to many\nspheres of life and that democracy\ncan take many forms. There can be\nvarious ways of taking decisions in\na democratic manner, as long as the\nbasic principle of consultation on an\nequal basis is accepted. The most\ncommon form of democracy in\ntoday’s world is rule through\npeople’s elected representatives. We\nshall read more about that in\nChapter 3. But if the community is\nsmall, there can be other ways of\ntaking democratic decisions. All the\npeople can sit together and take\ndecisions directly.

The features\nof democracy that we discussed in\nthis chapter provide only the\nminimum conditions of a\ndemocracy. That does not make it\nan ideal democracy. Every\ndemocracy has to try to realise the\nideals of a democratic decision-\nmaking. This cannot be achieved\nonce and for all. This requires a\nconstant effort to save and\nstrengthen democratic forms of\ndecision-making. What we do as\ncitizens can make a difference to\nmaking our country more or less\ndemocratic. This is the strength andthe weakness of democracy: the fate\nof the country depends not just on\nwhat the rulers do, but mainly on\nwhat we, as citizens, do.\nThis is what distinguished\ndemocracy from other governments.\nOther forms of government like\nmonarchy, dictatorship or one-party\nrule do not require all citizens to\ntake part in politics. In fact most\nnon-democratic governments\nwould like citizens not to take part\nin politics. But democracy depends\non active political participation by\nall the citizens. That is why a study\nof democracy must focus on\ndemocratic politics.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n16 DEMOCRA TIC POLITICS4 Each of these statements contains a democratic and an undemocratic\nelement.
