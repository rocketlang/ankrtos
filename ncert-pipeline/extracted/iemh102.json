You also have studied how to factorise some algebraic\nexpressions. You may recall the algebraic identities :\n(x + y)2 =x2 + 2xy + y2\n(x – y)2 =x2 – 2xy + y2\nand x2 – y2 =(x + y) (x – y)\nand their use in factorisation. In this chapter , we shall start our study with a particular\ntype of algebraic expression, called polynomial,  and the terminology related to it. We\nshall also study the Remainder Theor em and Factor Theor em and their use in the\nfactorisation of polynomials. In addition to the above, we shall study some more algebraic\nidentities and their use in factorisation and in evaluating some given expressions.\n2.2 Polynomials in One Variable\nLet us begin by recalling that a variable is denoted by a symbol that can take any real\nvalue. We use the letters x, y, z, etc. to denote variables. Notice that 2 x, 3x, – x, –1\n2x\nare algebraic expressions. All these expressions are of the form (a constant) × x. Now\nsuppose we want to write an expression which is (a constant) × (a variable) and we do\nnot know what the constant is. In such cases, we write the constant as a, b, c, etc. So\nthe expression will be ax , say.\nHowever , there is a dif ference between a letter denoting a constant and a letter\ndenoting a variable. The values of the constants remain the same throughout a particular\nsituation, that is, the values of the constants do not change in a given problem, but the\nvalue of a variable can keep changing.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n26 MATHEMA TICS\nNow , consider a square of side 3 units (see Fig. 2.1).\nWhat is its perimeter?  You know that the perimeter of a square\nis the sum of the lengths of its four sides. Here, each side is\n3 units. So, its perimeter is 4 × 3, i.e., 12 units. What will be the\nperimeter if each side of the square is 10 units? The perimeter\nis 4 × 10, i.e., 40 units. In case the length of each side is x\nunits (see Fig. 2.2), the perimeter is given by 4 x units. So, as\nthe length of the side varies, the perimeter varies.\nCan you find the area of the square PQRS? It is\nx × x = x2 square units. x2 is an algebraic expression. You are\nalso familiar with other algebraic expressions like\n2x, x2 + 2x,x3 – x2 + 4x + 7. Note that, all the algebraic\nexpressions we have considered so far have only whole\nnumbers as the exponents of the variable. Expressions of this\nform are called polynomials in one variable . In the examples\nabove, the variable is x. For instance, x3 – x2 + 4x + 7 is a\npolynomial in x. Similarly , 3y2 + 5y is a polynomial in the\nvariable y and t2 + 4 is a polynomial in the variable t.\nIn the polynomial x2 + 2x, the expressions x2 and 2 x are called the terms  of the\npolynomial. Similarly , the polynomial 3 y2 + 5y + 7 has three terms, namely , 3y2, 5y and\n",

      "title": "Can you write the terms of the polynomial – x3 + 4x2",
      "content": "7. Can you write the terms of the polynomial – x3 + 4x2 + 7x – 2 ? This polynomial has\n4 terms, namely , –x3, 4x2, 7x and –2.\nEach term of a polynomial has a coefficient . So, in – x3 + 4x2 + 7x – 2, the\ncoefficient of x3 is –1, the coefficient of x2 is 4, the coefficient of x is 7 and –2 is the\ncoefficient of x0 (Remember , x0 = 1). Do you know the coef ficient of x in x2 – x + 7?\nIt is –1.\n2 is also a polynomial. In fact, 2, –5, 7, etc. are examples of constant polynomials .\nThe constant polynomial 0 is called the zero polynomial\n. This plays a very important\nrole in the collection of all polynomials, as you will see in the higher classes.\nNow , consider algebraic expressions such as x + 2 31, 3 and .+ +x y yx Do you\nknow that you can write x + 1\nx = x + x–1? Here, the exponent of the second term, i.e.,\nx–1 is –1, which is not a whole number . So, this algebraic expression is not a polynomial.\nAgain, 3x+ can be written as 1\n23 x+. Here the exponent of x is 1\n2, which is\nnot a whole number . So, is 3x+ a polynomial? No, it is not. What about\n3y + y2? It is also not a polynomial (Why?).Fig. 2.1\nFig. 2.233 33\nxx xxS R\nP Q\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPOLYNOMIALS 27\nIf the variable in a polynomial is x, we may denote the polynomial by p(x), or q(x),\nor r(x), etc. So, for example, we may write :\np(x) =2x2 + 5x – 3\nq(x) =x3 –1\nr(y) =y3 + y + 1\ns(u) =2 – u – u2 + 6u5\nA polynomial can have any (finite) number of terms. For instance, x150 + x149 + ...\n+ x2 + x + 1 is a polynomial with 151 terms.\nConsider the polynomials 2 x, 2, 5 x3, –5x2, y and u4. Do you see that each of these\npolynomials has only one term? Polynomials having only one term are called monomials\n(‘mono’ means ‘one’).\nNow observe each of the following polynomials:\np(x) = x + 1, q(x) = x2 – x, r(y) = y9 + 1, t(u) = u15 – u2\nHow many terms are there in each of these? Each of these polynomials has only\ntwo terms. Polynomials having only two terms are called binomials  (‘bi’ means ‘two’).\nSimilarly , polynomials having only three terms are called trinomials\n(‘tri’ means ‘three’). Some examples of trinomials are\np(x) = x + x2 + π, q(x) = 2 + x – x2,\nr(u) = u + u2 – 2, t(y) = y4 + y + 5.\nNow , look at the polynomial p(x) = 3 x7 – 4x6 + x + 9. What is the term with the\nhighest power of x ? It is 3 x7. The exponent of x in this term is 7. Similarly , in the\npolynomial q(y) = 5 y6 – 4y2 – 6, the term with the highest power of y is 5y6 and the\nexponent of y in this term is 6. We call the highest power of the variable in a polynomial\nas the degree of the polynomial . So, the degree of the polynomial 3 x7 – 4x6 + x + 9\nis 7 and the degree of the polynomial 5 y6 – 4y2 – 6 is 6. The degree of a non-zero\nconstant polynomial is zero .\nExample 1 :  Find the degree of each of the polynomials given below:\n(i)x5 – x4 + 3 (ii) 2 – y2 – y3 + 2y8(iii) 2\nSolution :  (i) The highest power of the variable is 5. So, the degree of the polynomial\nis 5.\n(ii)The highest power of the variable is 8. So, the degree of the polynomial is 8.\n(iii)The only term here is 2 which can be written as 2 x0. So the exponent of x is 0.\nTherefore, the degree of the polynomial is 0.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n28 MATHEMA TICS\nNow observe the polynomials p (x) = 4 x + 5, q(y) = 2 y, r(t) = t + 2and\ns(u) = 3 – u. Do you see anything common among all of them? The degree of each of\nthese polynomials is one. A polynomial of degree one is called a linear polynomial .\nSome more linear polynomials in one variable are 2 x – 1, 2y + 1, 2 – u . Now , try and\nfind a linear polynomial in x with 3 terms? You would not be able to find it because a\nlinear polynomial in x can have at most two terms. So, any linear polynomial in x will\nbe of the form ax + b, where a and b are constants and a ≠ 0 (why?). Similarly ,\nay + b is a linear polynomial in y.\nNow consider the polynomials :\n2x2 + 5, 5x2 + 3x + π,x2 and x2 + 2\n5x\nDo you agree that they are all of degree two? A polynomial of degree two is called\na quadratic polynomial. Some examples of a quadratic polynomial are 5 – y2,\n4y + 5y2 and 6 – y – y2. Can you write a quadratic polynomial in one variable with four\ndifferent terms? You will find that a quadratic polynomial in one variable will have at\nmost 3 terms. If you list a few more quadratic polynomials, you will find that any\nquadratic polynomial in x is of the form ax2 + bx + c, where a ≠ 0 and a, b, c are\nconstants. Similarly , quadratic polynomial in y will be of the form ay2 + by + c, provided\na ≠ 0 and a, b, \nc are constants.\nWe call a polynomial of degree three a cubic polynomial . Some examples of a\ncubic polynomial in x are 4 x3, 2x3 + 1, 5 x3 + x2, 6x3 – x, 6 – x3, 2x3 + 4x2 + 6x + 7. How\nmany terms do you think a cubic polynomial in one variable can have? It can have at\nmost 4 terms. These may be written in the form ax3 + bx2 + cx + d, where a ≠ 0 and\na, b, c and d are constants.\nNow , that you have seen what a polynomial of degree 1, degree 2, or degree 3\nlooks like, can you write down a polynomial in one variable of degree n for any natural\nnumber n? A polynomial in one variable x of degree n is an expression of the form\n anxn + an–1xn–1 + . . . + a1x + a0\nwhere a0, a1, a2, . . ., an are constants and an ≠ 0.\nIn particular , if a0 = a1 = a2 = a3 = . . . = an = 0 (all the constants are zero), we get\nthe zero polynomial , which is denoted by 0. What is the degree of the zero polynomial?\nThe degree of the zero polynomial is not defined .\nSo far we have dealt with polynomials in one variable only . We can also have\npolynomials in more than one variable. For example, x2 + y2 + xyz (where variables\nare x, y and z) is a polynomial in three variables. Similarly p2 + q10 + r (where the\nvariables are p, q and r), u3 + v2 (where the variables are u and v) are polynomials in\nthree and two variables, respectively . You will be studying such polynomials in detail\nlater.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPOLYNOMIALS 29\nEXERCISE 2.1\n1.Which of the following expressions are polynomials in one variable and which are\nnot? State reasons for your answer .\n(i)4x2 – 3x + 7 (ii)y2 + 2 (iii)3 2t t+ (iv)y + 2\ny\n(v)x10 + y3 + t50\n2.Write the coef ficients of x2 in each of the following:\n(i)2 + x2 + x (ii)2 – x2 + x3(iii)2\n2x xπ+ (iv) 2 1x−\n3.Give one example each of a binomial of degree 35, and of a monomial of degree 100.\n4.Write the degree of each of the following polynomials:\n(i)5x3 + 4x2 + 7x (ii)4 – y2\n(iii)5t – 7 (iv)3\n5.Classify the following as linear , quadratic and cubic polynomials:\n(i)x2 + x (ii)x – x3(iii)y + y2 + 4 (iv)1 + x\n(v)3t (vi)r2(vii) 7x3\n2.3 Zeroes of a Polynomial\nConsider the polynomial p(x) =5x3 – 2x2 + 3x – 2.\nIf we replace x by 1 everywhere in p(x), we get\np(1) = 5 × (1)3 – 2 × (1)2 + 3 × (1) – 2\n=5 – 2 + 3 –2\n=4\nSo, we say that the value of p(x) at x = 1 is 4.\nSimilarly , p(0) = 5(0)3 – 2(0)2 + 3(0) –2\n=–2\nCan you find p(–1)?\nExample 2 :  Find the value of each of the following polynomials at the indicated value\nof variables:\n(i)p(x) = 5 x2 – 3x + 7 at x = 1.\n(ii)q(y) = 3y3 – 4y + 11 at y = 2.\n(iii)p(t) = 4 t4 + 5t3 – t2 + 6 at t = a.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n30 MATHEMA TICS\nSolution :  (i) p(x) = 5 x2 – 3x + 7\nThe value of the polynomial p(x) at x = 1 is given by\np(1) = 5(1)2 – 3(1) + 7\n=5 – 3 + 7 = 9\n(ii)q(y) = 3 y3 – 4y + 11\nThe value of the polynomial q(y) at y = 2 is given by\nq(2) = 3(2)3 – 4(2) + 11 = 24 – 8 + 11 = 16 + 11\n(iii) p(t) = 4 t4 + 5t3 – t2 + 6\nThe value of the polynomial p(t) at t = a is given by\n p(a) =4a4 + 5a3 – a2 + 6\nNow , consider the polynomial p(x) = x – 1.\nWhat is p(1)? Note that :  p(1) = 1 – 1 = 0.\nAs p(1) = 0, we say that 1 is a zero of the polynomial p(x).\nSimilarly , you can check that 2 is a zero of q(x), where q(x) = x – 2.\nIn general, we say that a zero of a polynomial p(x) is a number c such that p(c) = 0.\nYou must have observed that the zero of the polynomial x – 1 is obtained by\nequating it to 0, i.e., x – 1 = 0, which gives x = 1. We say p(x) = 0 is a polynomial\nequation and 1 is the root of the polynomial equation p(x) = 0. So we say 1 is the zero\nof the polynomial x – 1, or a root of the polynomial equation x – 1 = 0.\nNow , consider the constant polynomial 5. Can you tell what its zero is? It has no\nzero because replacing x by any number in 5 x0 still gives us 5. In fact, a non-zer o\nconstant polynomial has no zer o. What about the zeroes of the zero polynomial? By\nconvention,  ever y real number is a zer o of the zer o polynomial .\nExample 3 :  Check whether –2 and 2 are zeroes of the polynomial x + 2.\nSolution :  Letp(x) = x + 2.\nThen p(2) = 2 + 2 = 4, p(–2) = –2 + 2 = 0\nTherefore, –2 is a zero of the polynomial x + 2, but 2 is not.\nExample 4 :  Find a zero of the polynomial p(x) = 2 x + 1.\nSolution :  Finding a zero of p(x), is the same as solving the equation\np(x) =0\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPOLYNOMIALS 31\nNow, 2x + 1 = 0 gives us x = 1–2\nSo, 1–2 is a zero of the polynomial 2 x + 1.\nNow , if p(x) = ax  + b, a ≠ 0, is a linear polynomial, how can we find a zero of\np(x)? Example 4 may have given you some idea. Finding a zero of the polynomial p(x),\namounts to solving the polynomial equation p(x) = 0.\nNow , p(x) = 0 means ax + b =0, a ≠ 0\nSo, ax =–b\ni.e., x =–b\na.\nSo, x = b\na− is the only zero of p(x), i.e., a linear polynomial has one and only one zer o.\nNow we can say that 1 is the zero of x – 1, and –2 is the zero of x + 2.\nExample 5 :  Verify whether 2 and 0 are zeroes of the polynomial x2 – 2x.\nSolution :  Let p(x) =x2 – 2x\nThen p(2) = 22 – 4 = 4 – 4 = 0\nand p(0) = 0 – 0 = 0\nHence, 2 and 0 are both zeroes of the polynomial x2 – 2x.\nLet us now list our observations:\n(i)A zero of a polynomial need not be 0.\n(ii)0 may be a zero of a polynomial.\n(iii) Every linear polynomial has one and only one zero.\n(iv) A polynomial can have more than one zero.\nEXERCISE 2.2\n1.Find the value of the polynomial 5 x – 4x2 + 3 at\n(i)x = 0 (ii)x = –1 (iii)x = 2\n2.Find p(0), p(1) and p(2) for each of the following polynomials:\n(i)p(y) = y2 – y + 1 (ii)p(t) = 2 + t + 2t2 – t3\n(iii)p(x) = x3(iv)p(x) = (x – 1) ( x + 1)\nReprint 2025-26\n\n32 MATHEMA TICS\n3.Verify whether the following are zeroes of the polynomial, indicated against them.\n(i)p(x) = 3x + 1, x = 1–3(ii)p(x) = 5x – π,x = 4\n5\n(iii)p(x) = x2 – 1, x = 1, –1 (iv)p(x) = (x  + 1) ( x – 2), x = – 1, 2\n(v)p(x) = x2,x = 0 (vi)p(x) = lx + m,x = –m\nl\n(vii)p(x) = 3x2 – 1, x = 1 2,\n3 3− (viii) p(x) = 2x + 1, x = 1\n2\n4.Find the zero of the polynomial in each of the following cases:\n(i)p(x) = x + 5 (ii)p(x) = x – 5 (iii)p(x) = 2x + 5\n(iv)p(x) = 3x – 2 (v)p(x) = 3x (vi)p(x) = ax, a ≠ 0\n(vii)p(x) = cx + d, c ≠ 0, c, d are real numbers.\n2.4 Factorisation of Polynomials\nLet us now look at the situation of Example 10 above more closely . It tells us that since\nthe remainder , 1\n2q −   = 0, (2 t + 1) is a factor of q(t), i.e., q(t) = (2 t + 1) g(t)\nfor some polynomial g(t). This is a particular case of the following theorem.\nFactor  Theor em :  If p(x) is a polynomial of degree n > 1 and a is any real number ,\nthen (i) x – a is a factor of p(x), if p(a) = 0, and (ii) p(a) = 0, if x – a is a factor of p(x).\nProof:  By the Remainder Theorem, p(x)=(x – a) q(x) + p(a).\n(i)If p(a) = 0, then p(x) = (x – a) q(x), which shows that x – a is a factor of p(x).\n(ii)Since x – a  is a factor of p(x), p(x) = (x – a) g(x) for same polynomial g(x).\nIn this case, p(a) = (a – a) g(a) = 0.\nExample 6 :  Examine whether x + 2 is a factor of x3 + 3x2 + 5x + 6 and of 2 x + 4.\nSolution :  The zero of x + 2 is –2. Let p(x) = x3 + 3x2 + 5x + 6 and s(x) = 2 x + 4\nThen, p(–2) = (–2)3 + 3(–2)2 + 5(–2) + 6\n=–8 + 12 – 10 + 6\n=0\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPOLYNOMIALS 33\nSo, by the Factor Theorem, x + 2 is a factor of x3 + 3x2 + 5x + 6.\nAgain, s(–2) = 2(–2) + 4 = 0\nSo, x + 2 is a factor of 2 x + 4. In fact, you can check this without applying the Factor\nTheorem, since 2 x + 4 = 2( x + 2).\nExample 7 :  Find the value of k, if x – 1 is a factor of 4 x3 + 3x2 – 4x + k.\nSolution :  As x – 1 is a factor of p(x) = 4 x3 + 3x2 – 4x + k, p(1) = 0\nNow, p(1) = 4(1)3 + 3(1)2 – 4(1) + k\nSo, 4 + 3 – 4 + k =0\ni.e., k =–3\nWe will now use the Factor Theorem to factorise some polynomials of degree 2 and 3.\nYou are already familiar with the factorisation of a quadratic polynomial like\nx2 + lx + m. You had factorised it by splitting the middle term lx as ax + bx so that\nab = m. Then x2 + lx + m = (x + a) (x + b). We shall now try to factorise quadratic\npolynomials of the type ax2 + bx + c, where a ≠ 0 and a, b, c are constants.\nFactorisation of the polynomial ax2 + bx + c by splitting the middle term  is as\nfollows:\nLet its factors be ( px + q) and ( rx + s). Then\nax2 + bx + c = (px + q) (rx + s) = pr x2 + (ps + qr) x + qs\nComparing the coef ficients of x2, we get a = pr.\nSimilarly , comparing the coef ficients of x, we get b = ps + qr.\nAnd, on comparing the constant terms, we get c = \nqs.\nThis shows us that b is the sum of two numbers ps and qr, whose product is\n(ps)(qr) = ( pr)(qs) = ac.\nTherefore, to factorise ax2 + bx + c, we have to write b as the sum of two\nnumbers whose product is ac. This will be clear from Example 13.\nExample 8 :  Factorise 6 x2 + 17 x + 5 by splitting the middle term, and by using the\nFactor Theorem.\nSolution 1 : (By splitting method)  : If we can find two numbers p and q such that\np + q = 17 and pq = 6 × 5 = 30, then we can get the factors.\nSo, let us look for the pairs of factors of 30. Some are 1 and 30, 2 and 15, 3 and 10, 5\nand 6. Of these pairs, 2 and 15 will give us p + q = 17.23x\nx= 3x = first term of quotient\nReprint 2025-26\n\n34 MATHEMA TICS\nSo, 6 x2 + 17 x + 5 =6x2 + (2 + 15) x + 5\n=6x2 + 2x + 15 x + 5\n=2x(3x + 1) + 5(3 x + 1)\n=(3x + 1) (2 x + 5)\nSolution 2 :  (Using the Factor Theorem)\n6x2 + 17 x + 5 = 217 566 6x x + +   = 6 p(x), say . If a and b are the zeroes of p(x), then\n6x2 + 17 x + 5 = 6( x – a) (x – b). So, ab = 5.\n6 Let us look at some possibilities for a and\nb. They could be 1 1 5 5,, , , 12 3 3 2± ± ± ± ± . Now , 1 1 17 1 5\n2 4 6 2 6p   = + +       ≠ 0. But\n1\n3p− \n   = 0. So, 1\n3x +   is a factor of p(x). Similarly , by trial, you can find that\n5\n2x +   is a factor of p(x).\nTherefore, 6x2 + 17 x + 5 = 61 5\n3 2x x  + +    \n=3 1 2 563 2x x+ +  \n    \n=(3x + 1) (2 x + 5)\nFor the example above, the use of the splitting method appears more ef ficient. However ,\nlet us consider another example.\nExample 9 :  Factorise y2 – 5y + 6 by using the Factor Theorem.\nSolution :  Let p(y) = y2 – 5y + 6. Now , if p(y) = (y – a) (y – b), you know that the\nconstant term will be ab. So, ab = 6. So, to look for the factors of p(y), we look at the\nfactors of 6.\nThe factors of 6 are 1, 2 and 3.\nNow ,p(2) = 22 – (5 × 2) + 6 = 0\nSo, y – 2 is a factor of p(y).\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPOLYNOMIALS 35\nAlso, p(3) = 32 – (5 × 3) + 6 = 0\nSo, y – 3 is also a factor of y2 – 5y + 6.\nTherefore, y2 – 5y + 6 = ( y – 2)( y – 3)\nNote that y2 – 5y + 6 can also be factorised by splitting the middle term –5 y.\nNow , let us consider factorising cubic polynomials. Here, the splitting method will not\nbe appropriate to start with. We need to find at least one factor first, as you will see in\nthe following example.\nExample 10 :  Factorise x3 – 23 x2 + 142 x – 120.\nSolution :  Let p(x) =x3 – 23 x2 + 142 x – 120\nWe shall now look for all the factors of –120. Some of these are ±1, ±2, ±3,\n±4, ±5, ±6, ±8, ±10, ±12, ±15, ±20, ±24, ±30, ±60.\nBy trial, we find that p(1) = 0. So x – 1 is a factor of p(x).\nNow we see that x3 – 23 x2 + 142 x – 120 = x3 – x2 – 22\nx2 + 22 x + 120 x – 120\n                                            = x2(x –1) – 22 x(x – 1) + 120( x – 1) (Why?)\n                                            = (x – 1) ( x2 – 22 x + 120) [Taking ( x – 1) common]\nWe could have also got this by dividing p(x) by x – 1.\nNow x2 – 22 x + 120 can be factorised either by splitting the middle term or by using\nthe Factor theorem. By splitting the middle term, we have:\nx2 – 22 x + 120 = x2 – 12 x – 10 x + 120\n=x(x – 12) – 10( x – 12)\n=(x – 12) ( x – 10)\nSo, x3 – 23 x2 – 142 x – 120 = (x – 1)( x – 10)( x – 12)\nEXERCISE 2.3\n1.Determine which of the following polynomials has ( x + 1) a factor :\n(i)x3 + x2 + x + 1 (ii)x4 + x3 + x2 + x + 1\n(iii)x4 + 3x3 + 3x2 + x + 1 (iv)x3 – x2 – () 2 2 2 x+ +\n2.Use the Factor Theorem to determine whether g(x) is a factor of p(x) in each of the\nfollowing cases:\n(i)p(x) = 2x3 + x2 – 2x – 1, g(x) = x + 1\nReprint 2025-26\n\n36 MATHEMA TICS\n(ii)p(x) = x3 + 3x2 + 3x + 1, g(x) = x + 2\n(iii)p(x) = x3 – 4x2 + x + 6, g(x) = x – 3\n3.Find the value of k, if x – 1 is a factor of p(x) in each of the following cases:\n(i)p(x) = x2 + x + k (ii)p(x) = 2x2 + kx + 2\n(iii)p(x) = kx2 – 2x + 1 (iv)p(x) = kx2 – 3x + k\n4.Factorise :\n(i)12x2 – 7x + 1 (ii)2x2 + 7x + 3\n(iii)6x2 + 5x – 6 (iv)3x2 – x – 4\n5.Factorise :\n(i)x3 – 2x2 – x + 2 (ii)x3 – 3x2 – 9x – 5\n(iii)x3 + 13 x2 + 32x + 20 (iv)2y3 + y2 – 2y – 1\n2.5 Algebraic Identities\nFrom your earlier classes, you may recall that an algebraic identity is an algebraic\nequation that is true for all values of the variables occurring in it. You have studied the\nfollowing algebraic identities in earlier classes:\nIdentity I : (x + y)2 = x2 + 2xy + y2\nIdentity II : (x – y)2 = x2 – 2xy + y2\nIdentity III : x2 – y2 = (x + y) (x – y)\nIdentity IV : (x + a) (x + b) = x2 + (a  + b)x + ab\nYou must have also used some of these algebraic identities to factorise the algebraic\nexpressions. You can also see their utility in computations.\nExample 1 1 : Find the following products using appropriate identities:\n(i) (x + 3) (x + 3) (ii)(x – 3) ( x + 5)\nSolution :  (i) Here we can use Identity I : ( x + y)2 = x2 + 2xy + y2. Putting y = 3 in it,\nwe get\n(x + 3) ( x + 3) = (x + 3)2 = x2 + 2( x)(3) + (3)2\n=x2 + 6x + 9\n(ii) Using Identity IV above, i.e., ( x + a) (\nx + b) = x2 + (a + b)x + ab, we have\n(x – 3) ( x + 5) = x2 + (–3 + 5) x + (–3)(5)\n=x2 + 2x – 15\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPOLYNOMIALS 37\nExample 12 :  Evaluate 105 × 106 without multiplying directly .\nSolution : 105 × 106 = (100 + 5) × (100 + 6)\n=(100)2 + (5 + 6) (100) + (5 × 6), using Identity IV\n=10000 + 1 100 + 30\n=11130\nYou have seen some uses of the identities listed above in finding the product of some\ngiven expressions. These identities are useful in factorisation of algebraic expressions\nalso, as you can see in the following examples.\nExample 13 :  Factorise:\n(i) 49 a2 + 70 ab + 25 b2 (ii) 2\n225\n4 9yx−\nSolution :  (i) Here you can see that\n49a2 =(7a)2, 25b2 = (5 b)2, 70ab = 2(7 a) (5b)\nComparing the given expression with x2 + 2xy + y2, we observe that x = 7a and y = 5b.\nUsing Identity I, we get\n49a2 + 70 ab + 25 b2 =(7a + 5b)2 = (7 a + 5b) (7a + 5b)\n(ii) We have 2 2 2\n225 5– –4 9 2 3y yx x   =      \nNow comparing it with Identity III, we get\n2\n225–4 9yx  =2 25–2 3yx   \n      \n=5 5\n2 3 2 3y yx x  + −    \nSo far , all our identities involved products of binomials.

Note that the expansion of ( x + y + z)2 consists of three square terms\nand three product terms.\nExample 14 :  Write (3 a + 4b + 5c)2 in expanded form.\nSolution : Comparing the given expression with ( x + y + z)2, we find that\nx = 3a, y = 4b and z = 5c.\nTherefore, using Identity V, we have\n(3a + 4b + 5c)2 =(3a)2 + (4 b)2 + (5 c)2 + 2(3 a)(4b) + 2(4 b)(5c) + 2(5 c)(3a)\n=9a2 + 16 b2 + 25 c2 + 24 ab + 40 bc + 30 ac\nExample 15 :  Expand (4 a – 2b – 3c)2.\nSolution :  Using Identity V, we have\n(4a – 2b – 3c)2 =[4a + (–2 b) + (–3 c)]2\n=(4a)2 + (–2 b)2 + (–3 c)2 + 2(4 a)(–2b) + 2(–2 b)(–3c) + 2(–3 c)(4a)\n=16a2 + 4b2 + 9c2 – 16 ab + 12 bc – 24 ac\nExample 16 :  Factorise 4 x2 + \ny2 + z2 – 4xy – 2yz + 4xz.\nSolution :  We have 4 x2 + y2 + z2 – 4xy – 2yz + 4xz = (2 x)2 + (– y)2 + (z)2 + 2(2 x)(–y)\n+ 2(–y )(z) + 2(2 x)(z)\n=[2x + (– y) + z]2(Using Identity V)\n=(2x – y + z)2 = (2 x – y + z)(2x – y + z)\nSo far , we have dealt with identities involving second degree terms.
