The arrangement of these coefficients was in\nthe form of a diagram called Meru-Prastara , provided by Pingla in his book\nChhanda shastra (200B.C.). This triangular arrangement is also found in the\nwork of Chinese mathematician Chu-shi-kie in 1303. The term binomial coefficients\nwas first introduced by the German mathematician, Michael Stipel (1486-156 7) in\napproximately 1544. Bombelli (1572) also gave the coefficients in the expansion of\n(a + b)n, for n = 1,2 ...,7 and Oughtred (1631)  gave them for n = 1, 2,..., 10. The\narithmetic triangle, popularly known as Pascal’ s triangle  and similar to the Mer\nu-\nPrastara of Pingla was constructed by the French mathematician Blaise Pascal\n(1623-1662) in 1665.\nThe present form of the binomial theorem  for integral values of n appeared in\nTrate du triange arithmetic , written by Pascal and published posthumously in\n1665.\n—v vv vv—\nReprint 2025-26\n\n",
