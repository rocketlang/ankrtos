In order to have a unique set of direction cosines for\na given line in space, we must take the given line as a directed line. These unique\ndirection cosines are denoted by l, m and n.\nRemark  If the given line in space does not pass through the origin, then, in order to find\nits direction cosines, we draw a line through the origin and parallel to the given line.\nNow take one of the directed lines from the origin and find its direction cosines as two\nparallel line have same set of direction cosines.\nAny three numbers which are proportional to the direction cosines of a line are\ncalled the direction ratios  of the line. If l, m, n are direction cosines and a, b, c are\ndirection ratios of a line, then a = λl, b=λm and c = λn, for any nonzero λ ∈ R.\n/handptrtsld1Note    Some authors also call direction ratios as direction numbers.\nLet a, b, c be direction ratios of a line and let l, m and n be the direction cosines\n(d.c’s) of the line.

So, any two sets of direction ratios of a line are also proportional.\nAlso, for any line there are infinitely many sets of direction ratios.\n11.2.1   Direction cosines of a line passing through two point s\nSince one and only one line passes through two given points, we can determine the\ndirection cosines of a line passing through the given points P( x1, y1, z1) and Q( x2, y2, z2)\nas follows (Fig 1 1.2 (a)).\nFig 1 1.2\nLet l, m, n be the direction cosines of the line PQ and let it makes angles α, β and  γ\nwith the x, y and z-axis, respectively .\nDraw perpendiculars from P  and Q to XY -plane to meet at R and S.

Also, if two lines in space are parallel,\nthen the shortest distance between them\nwill be the perpendicular distance, i.e. the\nlength of the perpendicular drawn from a\npoint on one line onto the other line.\nFurther , in a space, there are lines which\nare neither intersecting nor parallel. In fact,\nsuch pair of lines are non coplanar  and\nare called skew lines .

These\nlines are skew because they are not parallel and also never meet.\nBy the shortest distance between two lines we mean the join of a point in one line\nwith one point on the other line so that the length of the segment so obtained is the\nsmallest.\nFor skew lines, the line of the shortest distance will be perpendicular to both\nthe lines.\n11.5.1   Dist ance between two skew lines\nWe now determine the shortest distance between two skew lines in the following way:\nLet l1 and l2  be two skew lines with equations (Fig. 1 1.6)\n =1 1+ λ/arrowrightnosp/arrowrightnospab     ...
