Let us now extend this\nstudy to three-dimensional system.\nLet P( x1, y1, z1) and Q ( x2, y2, z2)\nbe two points referred to a system of\nrectangular axes OX, OY and OZ.\nThrough the points P and Q draw planes\nparallel to the coordinate planes so as to\nform a rectangular parallelopiped with one\ndiagonal PQ (Fig 1 1.4).\nNow , since ∠PAQ is a right\nangle, it follows that, in triangle P AQ,\n     PQ2 = PA2 + AQ2... (1)\nAlso,  triangle ANQ is right angle triangle with ∠ANQ a right angle.Fig 1 1.4\nReprint 2025-26\n\n212  MATHEMA TICS\nTherefore AQ2 = AN2 + NQ2... (2)\nFrom (1) and (2), we have\nPQ2 = PA2 + AN2 + NQ2\nNow PA = y2 – y1, AN = x2 – x1 and NQ = z2 – z1\nHence PQ2 = (x2 – x1)2 + (y2 – y1)2 + (z2 – z1)2\nTherefore PQ = 2\n1 22\n1 22\n1 2 ) ( ) ( ) (z z y y x x− + − + −\nThis gives us the distance between two points ( x1, y1, z1) and ( x2, y2, z2).\nIn particular , if x1 = y1 = z1 = 0, i.e., point P  is origin O, then OQ = 2\n22\n22\n2 z y x+ + ,\nwhich gives the distance between the origin O and any point Q ( x2, y2, z2).\nExample 3  Find the distance between the points P(1, –3, 4) and Q (– 4, 1, 2).\nSolution  The distance PQ between the points P (1,–3, 4) and Q (– 4, 1, 2) is\nPQ= 2 2 2) 4 2 ( ) 3 1 ( ) 1 4 (− + + + − −\n= 4 16 25+ +\n= 45 = 3 5units\nExample 4  Show that the points P  (–2, 3, 5), Q (1, 2, 3) and R (7, 0, –1) are collinear .\nSolution  \nWe know that points are said to be collinear if they lie on a line.\nNow, PQ = 14 4 1 9 ) 5 3 ( ) 3 2 ( ) 2 1 (2 2 2= + + = − + − + +\nQR = 14 2 56 16 4 36 ) 3 1 ( ) 2 0 ( ) 1 7 (2 2 2= = + + = − − + − + −\nand PR = 14 3 126 36 9 81 ) 5 1 ( ) 3 0 ( ) 2 7 (2 2 2= = + + = − − + − + +\nThus, PQ + QR = PR.

The axes are called the x,\ny and z-axes.\n®The three planes determined by the pair of axes are the coordinate planes,\ncalled XY, YZ and ZX-planes .\n®The three coordinate planes divide the space into eight parts known as octants .\n®The coordinates of a point P in three dimensional geometry is always written\nin the form of triplet like ( x, y, z). Here x, y  and z are the distances from the\nYZ, ZX and XY-planes.\n® (i) Any point on x-axis is of the form ( x, 0, 0)\n (ii) Any point on y-axis is of the form (0, y, 0)\n(iii) Any point on z-axis is of the form (0, 0, z).\n®Distance between two points P (x1, y1, z1) and Q (x2, y2, z2) is given by\n2 2 2\n2 1 2 1 2 1 PQ ( x x ) ( y y ) ( z z )= − + − + −\nReprint 2025-26\n\n216  MATHEMA TICS\n—vvvvv—Historical Note\nRene’  Descartes (1596–1650), the father of analytical geometry , essentially dealt\nwith plane geometry only in 1637. The same is true of his co-inventor Pierre\nFermat (1601-1665) and La Hire (1640-1718). Although suggestions for the three\ndimensional coordinate geometry can be found in their works but no details.\nDescartes had the idea of coordinates in three dimensions but did not develop it.\nJ.Bernoulli (1667-1748) in a letter of 1715  to Leibnitz introduced the three coor-\ndinate planes which we use today . It was Antoinne Parent\n(1666-1716), who gave a systematic development of analytical solid geometry\nfor the first time in a paper presented to the French Academy in 1700.\nL.Euler (1707-1783) took up systematically the three dimensional coordinate ge-\nometry , in ",
