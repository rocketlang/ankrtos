      "content": "1. Which separation techniques will you apply for the separation\nof the following?\n(a) Sodium chloride from its solution in water\n(b) Ammonium chloride from a mixture containing sodium\nchloride and ammonium chloride\n(c) Small pieces of metal in the engine oil of a car\n(d) Different pigments from an extract of flower petals\n(e) Butter from curd\n(f)Oil from water\n(g) Tea leaves from tea\n(h) Iron pins from sand\n(i)Wheat grains from husk\n(j)Fine mud particles suspended in water• Mixtures can be separated into pure substances using\nappropriate separation techniques.\n• A solution is a homogeneous mixture of two or more\nsubstances. The major component of a solution is called the\nsolvent, and the minor , the solute.\n• The concentration of a solution is the amount of solute present\nper unit volume or per unit mass of the solution.\n• Materials that are insoluble in a solvent and have particles\nthat are visible to naked eyes, form a suspension.\nA suspension is a heterogeneous mixture.\n• Colloids are heterogeneous mixtures in which the particle\nsize is too small to be seen with the naked eye, but is big\nenough to scatter light. Colloids are useful in industry and\ndaily life. The particles are called the dispersed phase and\nthe medium in which they are distributed is called the\ndispersion medium.\n• Pure substances can be elements or compounds. An element\nis a form of matter that cannot be broken down by chemical\nreactions into simpler substances. A compound is a substance\ncomposed of two or more different types of elements,\nchemically combined in a fixed proportion.\n• Properties of a compound are different from its constituent\nelements, whereas a mixture shows the properties of its\nconstituting elements or compounds.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nIS MATTER AROUND  US PURE? 23(a) What mass of potassium nitrate would be needed to\nproduce a saturated solution of potassium nitrate in\n50 grams of water at 313 K?\n(b) Pragya makes a saturated solution of potassium chloride\nin water at 353 K and leaves the solution to cool at\nroom temperature. What would she observe as the\nsolution cools? Explain.\n(c) Find the solubility of each salt at 293 K. Which salt has\nthe highest solubility at this temperature?\n(d) What is the effect of change of temperature on the\nsolubility of a salt?\n4. Explain the following giving examples.\n(a) Saturated solution\n(b) Pure substance\n(c) Colloid\n(d) Suspension\n5. Classify each of the following as a homogeneous or\nheterogeneous mixture.\nsoda water , wood, air , soil, vinegar ,  filtered tea.\n6. How would you confirm that a colourless liquid given to you\nis pure water?2. Write the steps you would use for making tea.
