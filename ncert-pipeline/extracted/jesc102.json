What leads to this similarity in pr operties? W e saw in Activity\n2.3 that all acids generate hydrogen gas on reacting with metals, so\nhydrogen seems to be common to all acids. Let us perform an Activity to\ninvestigate whether all compounds containing hydrogen are acidic.\nActivity 2.8Activity 2.8Activity 2.8Activity 2.8Activity 2.8\n/square6Take solutions of glucose, alcohol,\nhydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid, etc.\n/square6Fix two nails on a cork, and place the cork in\na 100 mL beaker .\n/square6Connect the nails to the two terminals of a\n6 volt battery through a bulb and a switch, as\nshown in Fig. 2.3.\n/square6Now pour some dilute HCl in the beaker and\nswitch on the current.\n/square6Repeat with dilute sulphuric acid.\n/square6What do you observe?\n/square6Repeat the experiment separately with\nglucose and alcohol solutions.

Glowing of the bulb indicates that there is a flow of electric\ncurrent through the solution. The electric current is carried through the\nacidic solution by ions.\nAcids contain H+ ion as cation and anion such as Cl– in HCl, N O3– in\nHNO3, SO2–\n4 in H2SO4, CH3COO– in CH3COO\nH. Since the cation present in\nacids is H+, this suggests that acids produce hydrogen ions, H+(aq), in\nsolution, which are responsible for their acidic properties.\nRepeat the same Activity using alkalis such as sodium hydroxide, calcium\nhydroxide, etc. What can you conclude from the results of this Activity?\n2.2.1 What Happens to an Acid or a Base in a W ater Solution?\nDo acids produce ions only in aqueous solution?

The separation of H+ ion fr om HCl molecules\ncannot occur in the absence of water .\nHCl + H2O → H3O+ + Cl–\nHydrogen ions cannot exist alone, but they exist after combining\nwith water molecules. Thus hydrogen ions must always be shown as\nH+(aq) or hydronium ion (H3O+).\nH+ + H2O → H3O+\nWe have seen that acids give H3O+ or H+(aq) ion in water . Let us see\nwhat happens when a base is dissolved in water .\nNaOH(s)H O2 →   Na+ (aq) + OH– (aq)Note to teachers: If the climate is very humid, you will have to pass the gas produced\nthrough a guard tube (drying tube) containing calcium chloride to dry the gas.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nScience 24KOH(s) K (aq)+OH (aq)H O2 + → –\nMg(OH)2(s)H O2 →   Mg2+(aq)+2OH–(aq)\nBases generate hydr oxide (OH–) ions in water . Bases which are soluble\nin water are called alkalis.Do Y ou\nKnow?All bases do not dissolve in water . An alkali is a base that dissolves in water . They\nare soapy to touch, bitter and corrosive. Never taste or touch them as they may\ncause harm. Which of the bases in the Table 2.1 are alkalis?\nNow as we have identified that all acids generate H+(aq) and all\nbases generate OH–(aq), we can view the neutralisation reaction as\nfollows  –\nAcid + Base → Salt + W ater\nH  X + M  OH →  MX + HOH\nH+(aq) + OH– (aq) → H2O(l)\nLet us see what is involved when water is mixed with an acid or a base.\nActivity 2.10Activity 2.10Activity 2.10Activity 2.10Activity 2.10\n/square6Take 10 mL water in a beaker .\n/square6Add a few drops of concentrated H2SO4 to it and swirl the\nbeaker slowly.\n/square6Touch the base of the beaker .\n/square6Is there a change in temperature?\n/square6Is this an exothermic or endothermic process?\n/square6Repeat the above Activity with sodium hydroxide pellets\nand record your observations.Figure 2.5Figure 2.5Figure 2.5Figure 2.5Figure 2.5\nWarning sign displayed\non containers containing\nconcentrated acids and\nbasesThe process of dissolving an acid or a base in water is a highly\nexothermic one. Care must be taken while mixing concentrated nitric\nacid or sulphuric acid with water . The acid must always be added slowly\nto water with constant stirring. If water is added to a concentrated acid,\nthe heat generated may cause the mixture to splash out and cause burns.\nThe glass container may also break due to excessive local heating. Look\nout for the warning sign (shown in Fig. 2.5) on the can of concentrated\nsulphuric acid and on the bottle of sodium hydroxide pellets.\nMixing an acid or base with water results in decrease in the\nconcentration of ions (H3O+/OH–) per unit volume. Such a process is\ncalled dilution and the acid or the base is said to be diluted.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nAcids, Bases and Salts 252.3 HOW STRONG ARE ACID OR BASE SOLUTIONS?2.3 HOW STRONG ARE ACID OR BASE SOLUTIONS?2.3 HOW STRONG ARE ACID OR BASE SOLUTIONS?2.3 HOW STRONG ARE ACID OR BASE SOLUTIONS?2.3 HOW STRONG ARE ACID OR BASE SOLUTIONS?\nWe know how acid-base indicators can be used to distinguish between\nan acid and a base. W e have also lear nt in the previous section about\ndilution and decrease in concentration of H+ or OH– ions in solutions.\nCan we quantitatively find the amount of these ions present in a solution?\nCan we judge how strong a given acid or base is?\nWe can do this by making use of a universal indicator , which is a\nmixture of several indicators. The universal indicator shows different\ncolours at different concentrations of hydrogen ions in a solution.\nA scale for measuring hydrogen ion concentration in a solution, called\npH scale has been developed. The p in pH stands for ‘ potenz ’ in German,\nmeaning power . On the pH scale we can measur e pH generally fr om\n0 (very acidic) to 14 (very alkaline). pH should be thought of simply as a\nnumber which indicates the acidic or basic nature of a solution. Higher\nthe hydronium ion concentration, lower is the pH value.\nThe pH of a neutral solution is 7. V alues less than 7 on the pH scale\nrepresent an acidic solution. As the pH value increases from 7 to 14, it\nrepresents an increase in OH– ion concentration in the solution, that is,\nincrease in the strength of alkali (Fig. 2.6). Generally paper impregnated\nwith the universal indicator is used for measuring pH.QUESTIONS\n?1. Why do HCl, HNO3, etc., show acidic characters in aqueous solutions\nwhile solutions of compounds like alcohol and glucose do not show acidic\ncharacter?\n2. Why does an aqueous solution of an acid conduct electricity?\n3. Why does dry HCl gas not change the colour of the dry litmus paper?\n",

If we take hydrochloric acid and\nacetic acid of the same concentration, say one molar , then these pr oduce\ndifferent amounts of hydrogen ions. Acids that give rise to more H+ ions\nare said to be strong acids, and acids that give less H+ ions are said to be\nweak acids.

Living organisms can\nsurvive only in a narrow range of pH change. When pH of rain water is\nless than 5.6, it is called acid rain. When acid rain flows into the rivers, it\nlowers the pH of the river water . The survival of aquatic life in such rivers\nbecomes difficult.Table 2.2\n S.

To find out\nthe pH required for the healthy growth of a plant, you can collect the soil\nfrom various places and check the pH in the manner described below in\nActivity 2.12. Also, you can note down which plants are growing in the\nregion from which you have collected the soil.Acids in other planets\nThe atmosphere of venus is made up of thick white and yellowish clouds of\nsulphuric acid.

It helps in the digestion of food without harming the stomach.\nDuring indigestion the stomach produces too much acid and this causes\npain and irritation. To get rid of this pain, people use bases called\nantacids. One such remedy must have been suggested by you at the\nbeginning of this Chapter . These antacids neutralise the excess acid.\nMagnesium hydroxide (Milk of magnesia), a mild base, is often used for\nthis purpose.\npH change as the cause of tooth decay\nTooth decay starts when the pH of the mouth is lower than 5.5. Tooth\nenamel, made up of calcium hydroxyapatite (a crystalline form of calcium\nphosphate) is the hardest substance in the body. It does not dissolve in\nwater , but is corr oded when the pH in the mouth is below 5.5. Bacteria\npresent in the mouth produce acids by degradation of sugar and food\nparticles remaining in the mouth after eating. The best way to prevent\nthis is to clean the mouth after eating food. Using toothpastes, which are\ngenerally basic, for cleaning the teeth can neutralise the excess acid and\nprevent tooth decay.\nSelf defence by animals and plants through chemical warfare\nHave you ever been stung by a honey-bee? Bee-sting leaves an acid\nwhich  causes pain and irritation. Use of a mild base like baking soda\non the stung area gives relief. Stinging hair of nettle leaves inject\nmethanoic acid causing burning pain.Do Y ou\nKnow?\nReprint 2025-26\n\nScience 282.4 MORE ABOUT SAL2.4 MORE ABOUT SAL2.4 MORE ABOUT SAL2.4 MORE ABOUT SAL2.4 MORE ABOUT SAL TS TSTS TSTS\nIn the previous sections we have seen the formation of salts during\nvarious reactions.

For example, NaCl and Na2SO4 belong to the\nfamily of sodium salts.  Similarly, NaCl and KCl belong to the family\nof chloride salts.

On the other\nhand, salts of a strong acid and weak base\nare acidic with pH value less than 7 and those\nof a strong base and weak acid are basic in\nnature, with pH value more than 7.\n2.4.3 Chemicals from Common Salt\nBy now you have learnt that the salt formed\nby the combination of hydrochloric acid and\nsodium hydroxide solution is called sodium\nchloride. This is the salt that you use in food.\nYou must have observed in the above Activity\nthat it is a neutral salt.\nSeawater contains many salts dissolved\nin it. Sodium chloride is separated from these\nsalts. Deposits of solid salt are also found in\nseveral parts of the world. These large crystals\nare often brown due to impurities. This is\ncalled rock salt. Beds of rock salt were formed\nwhen seas of bygone ages dried up. Rock salt\nis mined like coal.\nYou must have hear d about Mahatma Gandhi’s Dandi  March. Did\nyou know that sodium chloride was such an important symbol in our\nstruggle for freedom?Table 2.4\nSalt pH Acid used Base used\nReprint 2025-26\n\nScience 30Common salt — A raw material for chemicals\nThe common salt thus obtained is an important raw material for various\nmaterials of daily use, such as sodium hydroxide, baking soda, washing\nsoda, bleaching powder and many more. Let us see how one substance\nis used for making all these different substances.\nSodium hydroxide\nWhen electricity is passed through an aqueous solution of sodium\nchloride (called brine), it decomposes to form sodium hydroxide. The\nprocess is called the chlor -alkali pr ocess because of the pr oducts for med–\nchlor for chlorine and alkali for sodium hydroxide.\n2NaCl(aq) + 2H2O(l) ® 2NaOH(aq) + Cl2(g) + H2(g)\nChlorine gas is given off at the anode, and hydrogen gas at the cathode.\nSodium hydroxide solution is formed near the cathode. The three\nproducts produced in this process are all useful. Figure 2.8 shows the\ndifferent uses of these products.\nBleaching powder\nYou have alr eady come to know that chlorine is pr oduced during the\nelectrolysis of aqueous sodium chloride (brine). This chlorine gas is used\nfor the manufactur e of bleaching powder . Bleaching powder is pr oduced\nby the action of chlorine on dry slaked lime [Ca(OH)2]. Bleaching powder\nis represented as Ca(ClO)2, though the actual composition is quite\ncomplex.\n2Ca(OH)2 + 2Cl2 ® Ca(ClO)2 + CaCl2 + 2H2OFigure 2.8  Important products from the chlor-alkali process\nReprint 2025-26\n\nAcids, Bases and Salts 31Bleaching powder is used –\n(i)for bleaching cotton and linen in the textile industry, for bleaching\nwood pulp in paper factories and for bleaching washed clothes\nin laundry;\n(ii)as an oxidising agent in many chemical industries; and\n(iii)to make drinking water free from germs.\nBaking soda\nThe baking soda is commonly used in the kitchen for making tasty crispy\npakoras, etc. Sometimes it is added for faster cooking. The chemical\nname of the compound is sodium hydrogencarbonate (NaHCO3). It is\nproduced using sodium chloride as one of the raw materials.\nNaCl + H O + CO + NH NH Cl + NaHCO2 2 3 4 3 →\n(Ammonium (Sodium\nchloride) hydrogencarbonate)\nDid you check the pH of sodium hydrogencarbonate in Activity 2.14?\nCan you correlate why it can be used to neutralise an acid? It is a mild\nnon-corrosive basic salt. The following reaction takes place when it is\nheated during cooking –\n2NaHCO Na CO + H O+CO3 2 3 2 2Heat → \n(Sodium (Sodium\nhydrogencarbonate) carbonate)\nSodium hydrogencarbonate has got various uses in the household.\nUses of Baking soda\n(i)For making baking powder , which is a mixture of baking soda\n(sodium hydrogencarbonate) and a mild edible acid such as\ntartaric acid. When baking powder is heated or mixed in water ,\nthe following reaction takes place –\nNaHCO3 + H+      →     CO2 + H2O + Sodium salt of acid\n         (From any acid)\nCarbon dioxide produced during the reaction can cause bread or\ncake to rise making them soft and spongy.\n(ii)Sodium hydrogencarbonate is also an ingredient in antacids.\nBeing alkaline, it neutralises excess acid in the stomach and\nprovides relief.\n(iii)It is also used in soda-acid fire extinguishers.\nWashing soda\nAnother chemical that can be obtained from sodium chloride is\nNa2CO3.10H2O (washing soda). Y ou have seen above that sodium\ncarbonate can be obtained by heating baking soda; recrystallisation of\nsodium carbonate gives washing soda. It is also a basic salt.\nNa CO H O Na CO H O\nSodium\ncarb\nonate2 3 2 2 3 21 0 10 + → .\n(\n)\nReprint 2025-26\n\nScience 32\nWhat does 10H2O signify? Does it make Na2CO3 wet? W e will addr ess\nthis question in the next section.\nSodium carbonate and sodium hydrogencarbonate are useful\nchemicals for many industrial processes as well.\nUses of washing soda\n(i)Sodium carbonate (washing soda) is used in glass, soap and\npaper industries.\n(ii)It is used in the manufacture of sodium compounds such as borax.\n(iii)Sodium carbonate can be used as a cleaning agent for domestic\npurposes.\n(iv)It is used for r emoving per manent har dness of water .\n2.4.4 Are the Cr ystals of Salts really Dr y?\nActivity 2.15Activity 2.15Activity 2.15Activity 2.15Activity 2.15\n/square6Heat a few crystals of copper sulphate\nin a dry boiling tube.\n/square6What is the colour of the copper\nsulphate after heating?\n/square6Do you notice water droplets in the\nboiling tube?

When we heat the crystals, this water is removed and the\nsalt turns white.\nIf you moisten the crystals again with water , you will find that blue\ncolour of the crystals reappears.\nWater of crystallisation is the fixed number of water molecules pr esent\nin one formula unit of a salt. Five water molecules are present in one\nformula unit of copper sulphate. Chemical formula for hydrated copper\nsulphate is Cu SO4. 5H2O. Now you would be able to answer the question\nwhether the molecule of Na2CO3.10H2O is wet.\nOne other salt, which possesses water of crystallisation is gypsum.\nIt has two water molecules as water of cyrstallisation. It has the chemical\nformula CaSO4.2H2O. Let us look into the use of this salt.\nPlaster of Paris\nOn heating gypsum at 373 K, it loses water molecules and becomes\ncalcium sulphate hemihydrate  ( 4 21CaSO . H O2). This is called Plaster of\nReprint 2025-26\n\nAcids, Bases and Salts 33Paris, the substance which doctors use as plaster for supporting\nfractured bones in the right position.
