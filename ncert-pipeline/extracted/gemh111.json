For example, 47561 = 4 × 10000 + 7 × 1000 + 5 × 100 + 6 × 10 + 1\nThis can be written as 4 × 104 + 7 ×103 + 5 × 102 + 6 × 10 + 1.\nTry writing these numbers in the same way 172, 5642, 6374.\nIn all the above given examples, we have seen numbers whose base is 10. However\nthe base can be any other number also. For example:\n81 = 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 can be written as 81 = 34, here 3 is the base and 4 is the exponent.\nSome powers have special names. For example,\n102, which is 10 raised to the power 2, also read as ‘10 squared’ and\n103, which is 10 raised to the power 3, also read as ‘10 cubed’.\nCan you tell what 53 (5 cubed) means?\n53 = 5 × 5 × 5 = 125\nSo, we can say 125 is the third power of 5.\nWhat is the exponent and the base in 53?\nSimilarly , 25  = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 =  32, which is the fifth power of 2.\nIn 25, 2 is the base and 5 is the exponent.\nIn the same way , 243 = 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 = 35\n64 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 26\n625 = 5 × 5 × 5 × 5 = 54\nFind five more such examples, where a number is expressed in exponential\nform. Also identify the base and the exponent in each case.\nYou can also extend this way of writing when the base is a negative integer .\nWhat does (–2)3 mean?\nIt is (–2)3 =(–2) ×  (–2) ×  (–2) = – 8\nIs (–2)4 =16? Check it.\nInstead of taking a fixed number let us take any integer a as the base, and write the\nnumbers as,\na × a\n =a2  (read as ‘ a squared’ or ‘ a raised to the power 2’)\na × a × a =a3  (read as ‘ a cubed’ or ‘ a raised to the power 3’)\na × a × a × a =a4 (read as a raised to the power 4 or the 4th power of a)\n..............................\na × a × a × a × a × a × a = a7  (read as a raised to the power 7 or the 7th power of a)\nand so on.\na × a × a × b × b  can be expressed as a3b2 (read as a cubed b squared)\nTRY THESE\n2024-25\n\nMATHEMA TICS 172\na × a × b  × b × b × b can be expressed as a2b4 (read as a\nsquared into b raised to the power of 4).\nEXAMPLE  1 Express 256 as a power 2.\nSOLUTION We have 256 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2.\nSo we can say  that 256  = 28\nEXAMPLE  2Which one is greater 23 or 32?\nSOLUTION We have, 23 = 2 × 2 × 2 = 8    and\n32  = 3 × 3 = 9.\nSince 9 > 8, so, 32 is greater than 23\nEXAMPLE 3Which one is greater 82 or 28?\nSOLUTION 82 =8 × 8 = 64\n28  =2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2  =  256\nClearly , 28 >82\nEXAMPLE  4Expand a3 b2, a2 b3, b2 a3, b3 a2. Are they all same?\nSOLUTION a3 b2  =a3 × b2\n= (a × a × a) × (b × b\n)\n=a × a × a × b × b\na2 b3 =a2 × b3\n=a × a × b × b × b\nb2 a3 =b2 × a3\n=b × b × a × a × a\nb3 a2 =b3 × a2\n=b × b × b × a × aTRY THESE\nExpress:\n(i)729 as a power of 3\n(ii)128 as a power of 2\n(iii) 343 as a power of 7\n272\n236\n218\n39\n3Note that in the case of terms a3 b2 and a2 b3 the powers of a and b are different. Thus\na3 b2 and a2 b3 are different.\nOn the other hand, a3 b2 and b2 a3 are the same, since the powers of a and b in these\ntwo terms are the same. The order of factors does not matter .\nThus, a3 b2 = a3 × b2 = b2 × a3 = b2 a3. Similarly , a2 b3 and b3 a2 are the same.\nEXAMPLE  5Express the  following numbers as a product of powers of prime factors:\n(i)72 (ii)432 (iii) 1000 (iv) 16000\nSOLUTION\n   (i) 72 = 2 × 36 = 2 × 2 × 18\n=2 × 2 × 2 × 9\n=2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 = 23 × 32\nThus, 72 = 23 × 32 (required prim e factor product form)\n2024-25\n\nEXPONENTS AND POWERS 173\n(ii)432 = 2 × 216 = 2 × 2 × 108 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 54\n=2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 27 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 9\n=2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 3\n  or 432 = 24 × 33(required form )\n(iii) 1000 = 2 × 500 = 2 × 2 × 250 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 125\n=2 × 2 × 2 × 5 × 25 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 5 × 5 × 5\n  or 1000 = 23 × 53\nAtul wants to solve this example in another way:\n1000 = 10 × 100 = 10 × 10 × 10\n= (2 × 5) × (2 × 5) × (2 × 5) (Since10 = 2 × 5)\n=2 × 5 × 2 × 5 × 2 × 5 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 5 × 5 × 5\n  or 1000 =  23 × 53\nIs Atul’ s method correct?\n(iv) 16,000 =  16 × 1000  =  (2 × 2 × 2 × 2) ×1000 = 24 ×103 (as 16 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2)\n=(2 × 2 × 2 × 2) × (2 × 2 × 2 × 5 × 5 × 5) = 24 × 23 × 53\n(Since  1000 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 5 × 5 × 5)\n=(2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 ) × (5 × 5 × 5)\n  or, 16,000 = 27 × 53\nEXAMPLE  6Work out (1)5, (–1)3, (–1)4, (–10)3, (–5)4.\nSOLUTION\n(i)We have (1)5 = 1 × 1 × 1 × 1 × 1 = 1\nIn fact, you will realise that 1 raised to any power is 1.\n(ii)(–1)3 = (–1) × (–1) × (–1) = 1 × (–1) = –1\n(iii) (–1)4 = (–1) × (–1) × (–1) × (–1) = 1 ×1 = 1\nYou may check that (–1) raised to any odd power is (–1),\nand (–1) raised to any even  power is (+1).\n(iv) (–10)3 = (–10) × (–10) × (–10) = 100 × (–10) = – 1000\n(v)(–5)4 = (–5) × (–5) × (–5) × (–5) = 25 × 25 = 625\nEXERCISE  11.1\n1.Find the value of:\n(i) 26(ii)93(iii) 112(iv) 54\n2.Express the following in exponential form:\n(i)6 × 6 × 6 × 6 (ii)t × t (iii) b × b × b × b\n(iv) 5 × 5× 7 × 7 × 7 (v)2 × 2 × a × a (vi) a × a × a × c × c × c × c × dodd number(–1) = –1\neven number(–1) = + 1\n2024-25\n\nMATHEMA TICS 174\n3.Express each of the f ollowing numbers using exponential notation:\n(i)512 (ii)343 (iii) 729 (iv) 3125\n4.Identify the greater number , wherever possible, in each of the following?\n(i)43 or 34(ii)53  or 35(iii) 28 or 82\n(iv) 1002 or 2100(v)210 or 102\n5.Express each of the following as product of powers of their prime factors:\n(i)648 (ii)405 (iii) 540 (iv) 3,600\n6.Simplif y:\n(i)2 × 103(ii)72 × 22(iii) 23 × 5 (iv) 3 × 44\n(v)0 × 102(vi) 52 × 33(vii) 24 × 32(viii) 32 × 104\n7.Simplif y:\n(i)(– 4)3(ii)(–3) × (–2)3(iii) (–3)2 × (–5)2\n(iv) (–2)3 × (–10)3\n8.Compare the following numbers:\n(i)2.7 × 1012 ; 1.5 × 108(ii)4 × 1014  ; 3 × 1017\n11.3  L AWS OF EXPONENTS\n11.3.1  Multiplying Powers with the Same Base\n(i)Let us calculate 22 × 23\n22 × 23 =(2 × 2) × (2 × 2 × 2)\n=2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 25 = 22+3\nNote that the base in 22 and 23 is same and the sum of the exponents, i.e., 2 and 3 is 5\n(ii)(–3)4 × (–3)3 = [(–3) × (–3) × (–3)× (–3)]  × [(–3) × (–3) × (–3)]\n=(–3) × (–3) × (–3) × (–3) × (–3) × (–3) × (–3)\n=(–3)7\n=(–3)4+3\nAgain, note that the base is same and the sum of exponents, i.e., 4 and 3, is 7\n(iii) a2 × a4 = (a × a) × (\na × a × a  × a)\n= a × a × a × a × a × a =  a6\n(Note: the base is the same and the sum of the exponents is 2 + 4 = 6)\nSimilarly , verif y:\n42 × 42 =42+2\n32 × 33 =32+3\n2024-25\n\nEXPONENTS AND POWERS 175\nCan you write the appropriate number in the box.\n(–11)2 × (–1 1)6 = (–11)\nb2 × b3 =b (Remember , base is same; b is any integer).\nc3 × c4 =c  (c is any integer)\nd10 ×  d20 = d\nFrom this we can generalise that for any non-zero integer a, where m\nand n are whole numbers,\nam × an =am + n\nCaution!\nConsider 23 × 32\nCan you add the exponents?

We said that lar ge numbers can be\nconveniently expressed using exponents. We have not as yet shown this. We shall do so now .\n1.Sun is located 300,000,000,000,000,000,000 m from the centre of our Milky Way\nGalaxy .\n2.Number of stars in our Galaxy is 100,000,000,000.\n3.Mass of the Earth is 5,976,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 kg.\nThese numbers are not convenient to write and read. To make\nit convenient we use powers.\nObserve the following:\n      59 = 5.9 × 10 = 5.9 × 101\n    590 = 5.9 × 100 = 5.9 × 102\n  5900 = 5.9 × 1000 = 5.9 × 103\n59000 = 5.9 × 10000 = 5.9 × 104  and so on.TRY THESE\nExpand by expressing\npowers of 10 in the\nexponential form:\n(i)172\n(ii)5,643\n(iii)56,439\n(iv)1,76,428\n2024-25\n\nEXPONENTS AND POWERS 183\nWe have expressed all these numbers in the standard form . Any number can be\nexpressed as a decimal number between 1.0 and 10.0 including 1.0 multiplied by a power\nof 10. Such a form of a number is called its standard form . Thus,\n5,985 = 5.985 × 1,000 = 5.985 × 103  is the standard form of 5,985.\nNote, 5,985 can also be expressed as 59.85 × 100 or 59.85 × 102. But these are  not\nthe standard forms, of 5,985. Similarly , 5,985 = 0.5985 × 10,000 = 0.5985 × 104 is also\nnot the standard form of 5,985.\nWe are now ready to express the lar ge numbers we came across at the beginning of\nthe chapter in this form.\nThe, distance of Sun from the centre of our Galaxy  i.e.,\n300,000,000,000,000,000,000 m  can be written as\n3.0 × 100,000,000,000,000,000,000 = 3.0 ×\n 1020 m\nNow, can you express 40,000,000,000 in the similar way?\nCount the number of zeros in it. It is 10.\nSo, 40,000,000,000 = 4.0 × 1010\nMass of the Earth = 5,976,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 kg\n=5.976 × 1024 kg\nDo you agree with the fact, that the number when written in the standard form is much\neasier to read, understand and compare than when the number is written with 25 digits?\nNow ,\nMass of Uranus = 86,800,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 kg\n     = 8.68 × 1025 kg\nSimply by comparing the powers of 10 in the above two, you can tell that the mass of\nUranus is greater than that of the Earth.\nThe distance between Sun and Saturn is 1,433,500,000,000 m or 1.4335 × 1012 m.\nThe distance betwen Saturn and Uranus is 1,439,000,000,000 m  or 1.439 × 1012 m.  The\ndistance between Sun and Earth is 149, 600,000,000 m or 1.496 × 1011m.\nCan you tell which of the three distances is smallest?\nEXAMPLE  13Express the following numbers in the standard form:\n(i)5985.3 (ii)65,950\n(iii) 3,430,000 (iv) 70,040,000,000\nSOLUTION\n(i)5985.3 = 5.9853 × 1000 = 5.9853 × 103\n(ii)65,950 = 6.595 × 10,000 = 6.595 × 104\n(iii) 3,430,000 = 3.43 × 1,000,000 = 3.43 × 106\n(iv) 70,040,000,000 = 7.004 × 10,000,000,000 = 7.004 × 1010\n2024-25\n\nMATHEMA TICS 184\nA point to remember is that one less than the digit count (number of digits) to the left\nof the decimal point in a given number is the exponent of 10 in the standard form. Thus, in\n70,040,000,000 there is no decimal point shown; we assume it to be at the (right) end.\nFrom there, the count of the places (digits) to the left is 1 1. The exponent of 10 in the\nstandard form is 1 1 – 1 = 10. In 5985.3 there are 4 digits to the left of the decimal point\nand hence the expon ent of 10 in the standard form is 4 – 1 = 3.\nEXERCISE  11.3\n1.Write the following numbers in the expanded forms:\n279404, 3006194, 2806196, 120719, 20068\n2.Find the number from each of the following expanded forms:\n(a)8 ×104 + 6 ×103 + 0×102 + 4×101 + 5×100\n(b)4 ×105 + 5×103 + 3×102 + 2×100\n(c)3 ×104 + 7×102 + 5×100\n(d)9 ×105 + 2×102 + 3×101\n3.Express the following numbers in standard form:\n(i)5,00,00,000 (ii)70,00,000     (iii) 3,18,65,00,000\n       (iv)   3,90,878 (v)39087.8     (vi) 3908.78\n4.Express the number appearing in the following statements in standard form.\n(a)The distance between Earth and Moon is 384,000,000 m.\n(b)Speed of light in vacuum is 300,000,000 m/s.\n(c)Diameter of the Earth is 1,27,56,000 m.\n(d)Diameter of the Sun is 1,400,000,000 m.\n(e)In a galaxy there are on an average 100,000,000,000 stars.\n(f)The universe is estimated to be about 12,000,000,000 years old.\n(g)The distance of the Sun from the centre of the Milky Way Galaxy is estimated to\nbe 300,000,000,000,000,000,000 m.\n(h)60,230,000,000,000,000,000,000 molecules are contained in a drop of water\nweighing 1.8 gm.\n(i)The earth has 1,353,000,000 cubic km of sea water .\n(j)The population of India was about 1,027,000,000 in March, 2001.\n2024-25\n\nEXPONENTS AND POWERS 185\nWHAT HAVE WE DISCUSSED ?\n1.Very lar ge numbers are dif ficult to read, understand, compare and operate upon.
