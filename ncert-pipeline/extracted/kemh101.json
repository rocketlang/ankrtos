HARDY  v\n1.1  Introduction\nThe concept of set serves as a fundamental part of the\npresent day mathematics. Today this concept is being used\nin almost every branch of mathematics. Sets are us ed to\ndefine the concepts of relations and functions. The study of\ngeometry , sequences, probability , etc. requires the knowledge\nof sets.\nThe theory of sets was developed by German\nmathematician Georg Cantor (1845-1918). He first\nencountered sets while working on “problems on trigonometric\nseries”. In this Chapter , we discuss some basic definitions\nand operations involving sets.\n1.2  Sets and their Representations\nIn everyday life, we often speak of collections of objects of a particular kind, such as,\na pack of cards, a crowd of people, a cricket team, etc. In mathematics also, we come\nacross collections, for example, of natural numbers, points, prime numbers, etc. More\nspecially , we examine the following collections:\n(i)Odd natural numbers less than 10, i.e., 1, 3, 5, 7, 9\n(ii) The rivers of India\n(iii) The vowels in the English alphabet, namely , a, e, i, o, u\n(iv) Various kinds of triangles\n(v) Prime factors of 210, namely , 2,3,5 and 7\n(vi) The solution of the equation : x2 – 5x + 6 = 0, viz, 2 and 3.\nWe note that each of the above example is a well-defined collection of objects in\nReprint 2025-26\n\n2       MA THEMA TICS\nthe sense that we can definitely decide whether a given particular object belongs to a\ngiven collection or not. For example, we can say that the river Nile does not belong to\nthe collection of rivers of India. On the other hand, the river Ganga does belong to this\ncolleciton.\nWe give below a few more examples of sets used particularly in mathematics, viz.\nN:the set of all natural numbers\nZ:the set of all integers\nQ:the set of all rational numbers\nR:the set of real numbers\nZ+:the set of positive integers\nQ+:the set of positive rational numbers, and\nR+:the set of positive real numbers.\nThe symbols for the special sets given above will be referred to throughout\nthis text.\nAgain the collection of five most renowned mathematicians of the world is not\nwell-defined, because the criterion for determining a mathematician as most renowned\nmay vary from person to person. Thus, it is not a well-defined collection.\nWe shall say that a set is a well-defined collection of object s.\nThe following points may be noted :\n(i)Objects, elements and members of a set are synonymous  terms.\n(ii) Sets are usually denoted by capital letters A, B, C, X, Y, Z, etc.\n(iii) The elements of a set are represented by small letters a, b, c, x, y , z, etc.\nIf a is an element of a set A, we say that “ a belongs to A” the Greek symbol ∈\n(epsilon) is used to denote the phrase ‘ belongs to ’. Thus, we write a ∈ A. If ‘ b’ is not\nan element of a set A, we write b ∉ A and read  “ b does not belong to A”.\nThus, in the set V of vowels in the English alphabet, a ∈ V but b ∉ \nV. In the set\nP of prime factors of 30, 3 ∈ P but 15 ∉ P.\nThere are two methods of representing a set :\n(i)Roster or tabular form\n(ii) Set-builder form.\n(i) In roster form, all the elements of a set are listed, the elements are being separated\nby commas and are enclosed within braces {   }. For example, the set of all even\npositive integers less than 7 is described in roster form as {2, 4, 6}. Some more\nexamples of representing a set in rost er form are given below :\n(a) The set of all nat ural numbers which divide 42 is {1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 42}.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSETS        3\nANote   In roster form, the order in which the elements are listed is immaterial.\nThus, the above set can also be represented as {1, 3, 7, 21, 2, 6, 14, 42}.\n(b) The set of all vowels in the English alphabet is { a, e, i, o, u }.\n(c) The set of odd natural numbers is represented by {1, 3, 5, . . .}. The dots\ntell us that the list of odd numbers continue indefinitely .\nANote   It may be noted that while writing the set in roster form an element is not\ngenerally repeated, i.e., all the elements are taken as distinct. For example, the set\nof letters forming the word ‘ SCHOOL ’ is { S, C, H, O, L} or {H, O, L, C, S}. Here,\nthe order of listing elements has no relevance.\n(ii) In set-builder form, all the elements of a set possess a single common property\nwhich is not possessed by any element outside the set. For example, in the set\n{a, e, i, o, u }, all the elements possess a common property , namely , each of them\nis a vowel in the English alphabet, and no other letter possess this property . Denoting\nthis set by V, we write\nV = { x : x is a vowel in English alphabet}\nIt may be observed that we describe the element of the set by using a symbol x\n(any other symbol like the letters y, z, etc. could be used) which is followed by a colon\n“ : ”. After the sign of colon, we write the characteristic property possessed by the\nelements of the set and then enclose the whole description within braces. The above\ndescription of the set V is read as “the set of all x such that x is a vowel of the English\nalphabet”. In this description the braces stand for “the set of all”, the colon stands for\n“such that”. For example, the set\nA = { x : x is a natural number and 3 < x < 10} is read as “the set of all x such that\nx is a natural number and x lies between 3 and 10.” Hence, the numbers 4, 5, 6,\n7, 8 and 9 are the elements of the set A.\nIf we denote the sets described in ( a), (b) and ( c) above in roster form by A, B,\nC, respectively , then A, B, C can also be represented in set-builder form as  follows:\nA= {x : x is a natural number which divides 42}\nB= {y : y is a vowel in the English alphabet}\nC= {z : z is an odd natural number}\nExample 1  Write the solution set of the equation x2 + x – 2 = 0 in roster form.\nSolution\n The given equation can be written as\n(x – 1)  ( x + 2) = 0, i. e.,   x = 1, – 2\nTherefore, the solution set of the given equation can be written in roster form as {1, – 2}.\nExample 2 Write the set { x : x is a positive integer and x2 < 40} in the roster form.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n4       MA THEMA TICS\nSolution The required numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So, the given set in the roster form\nis {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\nExample 3  Write the set  A = {1, 4, 9, 16, 25, . . . } in set-builder form.\nSolution  We may write the set A as\nA = { x : x is the square of a natural number}\nAlternatively , we can write\nA = { x : x = n2, where n ∈ N}\nExample 4\n Write the set 1 2 3 4 5 6{ }2 3 4 5 6 7, , , , , in the set-builder form.\nSolution  We see that each member in the given set has the numerator one less than\nthe denominator . Also, the numerator begin from 1 and do not exceed 6. Hence, in the\nset-builder form the given set is\nwhere is a natural number and 1 61nx : x , n nn = ≤ ≤  +  \nExample 5 Match each of the set on the left described in the roster form with the\nsame set on the right described in the set-builder form :\n(i){P, R, I, N, C, A, L} (a) { x : x is a positive integer and is a divisor of 18}\n(ii) { 0 } (b) {  x : x is an integer and x2 – 9 = 0}\n(iii) {1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18} (c) {x : x is an integer and x + 1= 1}\n(iv) {3, –3} (d) { x : x is a letter of the word PRINCIP AL}\nSolution  Since in (d), there are 9 letters in the word PRINCIP AL and two letters P  and I\nare repeated, so (i) matches (d). Similarly , (ii) matches (c) as x + 1 = 1 implies\nx = 0. Also, 1, 2 ,3, 6, 9, 18 are all divisors of 18 and so (iii) matches (a). Finally , \nx2 – 9 = 0\nimplies x = 3, –3 and so (iv) matches (b).\nEXERCISE 1.1\n1. Which of the following are sets ?

Thus, the set A contains a finite number of elements.\nWe now write another set B as follows:\nReprint 2025-26\n\n6       MA THEMA TICS\nB = { x : x is a student presently studying in both Classes X and XI }\nWe observe that a student cannot study simultaneously in both Classes X and XI.\nThus, the set B contains no element at all.\nDefinition 1  A set which does not contain any element is called the empty set  or the\nnull set  or the void set\n.\nAccording to this definition, B is an empty set while A is not an empty set. The\nempty set is denoted by the symbol φ or {   }.\nWe give below a few examples of empty sets.\n(i)Let A = {x : 1 < x < 2, x is a natural number}. Then A is the empty set,\nbecause there is no natural number between 1 and 2.\n(ii)B = { x : x2 – 2 = 0 and x is rational number}. Then B is the empty set because\nthe equation x2 – 2 = 0 is not satisfied by any rational value of x.\n(iii) C = { x : x is an even prime number greater than 2}.Then C is the empty set,\nbecause 2 is the only even prime number .\n(iv) D = {  x : x2 = 4, x  is odd }. Then D is the empty set, because the equation\nx2 = 4 is not satisfied by any odd value of x.\n1.4  Finite and Infinite Sets\nLet A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, B = { a, b, c, d, e, g }\nand C = { men living pr esently in different parts of the world}\nWe observe that A contains 5 elements and B contains 6 elements. How many elements\ndoes C contain? As it is, we do not know the number of elements in C, but it is some\nnatural number which may be quite a big number . By number of elements of a set S,\nwe mean the number of distinct elements of the set and we denote it by n (S). If n (S)\nis a natural number , then S is non-empty finite set.\nConsider the set of natural numbers. We see that the number of elements of this\nset is not finite since there are infinite number of natural numbers. We say that the set\nof natural numbers is an infinite set. The sets A, B and C given above are finite sets\nand n(A) = 5, n (B) = 6 and n(C) = some finite number .\nDefinition 2  A set which is empty or consists of a definite number of elements is\ncalled finite otherwise, the set is called infinite .\nConsider some examples :\n(i)Let W be the set of the days of the week. Then W is finite.\n(ii) Let S be the set of solutions of the equation x2 –16 = 0. Then S is finite.\n(iii) Let G be the set of points on a line. Then G is infinite.\nWhen we represent a set in the roster form, we write all the elements of the set\nwithin braces {   }. It is not possible to write all the elements of an infinite set within\nbraces {  } because the numbers of elements of such a set is not finite. So, we represent\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSETS        7\nsome infinite set in the roster form by writing a few elements which clearly indicate the\nstructure of the set followed ( or preceded ) by three dots.\nFor example, {1, 2, 3 . . .} is the set of natural numbers, {1, 3, 5, 7, . . .} is the set\nof odd natural numbers, {. . .,–3, –2, –1, 0,1, 2 ,3, . . .} is the set of integers. All these\nsets are infinite.\nANote  All infinite sets cannot be described in the roster form. For example, the\nset of real numbers cannot be described in this form, because the elements of this\nset do not follow any particular pattern.\nExample 6  State which of the following sets are finite or infinite :\n(i) {x : x ∈ N and ( x – 1) ( x –2) = 0}\n(ii) {\nx : x ∈ N and x2 = 4}\n(iii) {x : x ∈ N and 2x –1 = 0}\n(iv) {x : x ∈ N and x is prime}\n(v) {x : x ∈ N and x is odd}\nSolution (i) Given set = {1, 2}. Hence, it is finite.\n(ii) Given set = {2}. Hence, it is finite.\n(iii) Given set = φ. Hence, it is finite.\n(iv) The given set is the set of all prime numbers and since set of prime\nnumbers is infinite. Hence the given set is infinite\n(v) Since there are infinite number of odd numbers, hence, the given set is\ninfinite.\n1.5  Equal Sets\nGiven two sets A and B, if every element of A is also an element of B and if every\nelement of B is also an element of A, then the sets A and B are said to be equal.\nClearly , the two sets have exactly the same elements.\nDefinition 3  Two sets A and B are said to be equal  if they have exactly the same\nelements and we write A = B. Otherwise, the sets are said to be unequal  and we write\nA ≠ B.\nWe consider the following examples :\n(i)Let A = {1, 2, 3, 4} and B = {3, 1, 4, 2}. Then A = B.\n(ii) Let A be the set of prime numbers less than 6 and P  the set of prime factors\nof 30. Then A and P  are equal, since 2, 3 and 5 are the only prime factors of\n30 and also these are less than 6.\nANote   A set does not change if one or more elements of the set are repeated.\nFor example, the sets A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {2, 2, 1, 3, 3} are equal, since each\nReprint 2025-26\n\n8       MA THEMA TICS\nelement of A is in B and vice-versa. That is why we generally do not repeat any\nelement in describing a set.\nExample 7  Find the pairs of equal sets, if any , give reasons:\nA = {0}, B = { x : x > 15 and x < 5},\nC = { x : x – 5 = 0 }, D = {\nx: x2 = 25},\nE = { x : x is an integral positive root of the equation x2 – 2x –15 = 0}.\nSolution Since 0 ∈ A and 0 does not belong to any of the sets B, C, D and E, it\nfollows that,  A ≠ B, A\n ≠ C, A ≠ D, A ≠ E.\nSince B = φ but none of the other sets are empty .  Therefore B ≠ C, B ≠ D\nand B ≠ E. Also C = {5} but –5 ∈ D, hence C ≠ D.\nSince E = {5}, C =  E.  Further , D = {–5, 5} and E = {5}, we find that, D ≠ E.\nThus, the only pair of equal sets is C and E.\nExample 8  Which of the following pairs of sets are equal? Justify your answer .\n(i)X, the set of letters in “ALLOY” and B, the set of letters in “LOY AL”.\n(ii) A =  { n : n ∈ Z and n2 ≤ 4} and B = { x : x ∈ R and x2 – 3x + 2 = 0}.\nSolution (i) We have, X = {A, L, L, O, Y}, B = {L, O, Y, A, L}. Then X and B are\nequal sets as repetition of elements in a set do not change a set. Thus,\nX = {A, L, O, Y} = B\n(ii) A = {–2, –1, 0, 1, 2},  B = {1, 2}.

From the sets given below , select equal sets :\nA = { 2, 4, 8, 12}, B = { 1, 2, 3, 4}, C = { 4, 8, 12, 14}, D = { 3, 1, 4, 2}\nE = {–1, 1}, F = { 0, a }, G = {1, –1}, H = { 0, 1}\n1.6  Subsets\nConsider the sets : X = set of all students in your school, Y = set of all students in your\nclass.\nWe note that every element of Y is also an element of X; we say that Y is a subset\nof X. The fact that Y is subset of X is expressed in symbols as Y ⊂ X. The symbol ⊂\nstands for ‘is a subset of ’ or ‘is contained in’.\nDefinition 4  A set A is said to be a subset of a set B if every element of A is also an\nelement of B.\nIn other words, A ⊂ B if whenever a ∈ A, then a \n∈ B. It is often convenient to\nuse the symbol “ ⇒” which means implies . Using this symbol, we can write the definiton\nof subset  as follows:\nA ⊂ B if a ∈ A ⇒ a ∈ B\nWe read the above statement as “A is a subset of B if a is an element of A\nimplies that a is also an element of B ”. If A is not a subset of B, we write A ⊄ B.\nWe may note that for A to be a subset of B, all that is needed is that every\nelement of A is in B. It is possible that every element of B may or may not be in A. If\nit so happens that every element of B is also in A, then we shall also have B ⊂ A. In this\ncase, A and B are the same sets so that we have A ⊂ B and B ⊂  A ⇔ A = B, where\n“⇔” is a symbol for two way implications, and is usually read as if and only if  (briefly\nwritten as “iff”).\nIt follows from the above definition that every set A is a subset of itself,  i.e.,\nA ⊂  A. Since the empty set φ has no elements, we agree to say that φ  is a subset of\nevery set. We now consider some examples :\nReprint 2025-26\n\n10       MA THEMA TICS\n(i)The set Q of rational numbers is a subset of the set R of real numbes, and\nwe write Q ⊂ R.\n(ii) If A is the set of all divisors  of 56 and B the set of all prime divisors of 56,\nthen B is a subset of A and we write B ⊂ A.\n(iii) Let A = {1, 3, 5} and B = { x : x is an odd natural number less than 6}. Then\nA\n ⊂ B and B ⊂ A and hence A = B.\n(iv) Let A = { a, e, i, o, u } and B = {  a, b, c, d }. Then A is not a subset of B,\nalso B is not a subset of A.\nLet A and B be two sets. If A ⊂ B and A ≠ B , then A is called a proper subset\nof B and B is called superset  of A. For example,\nA = {1, 2, 3} is a proper subset of B = {1, 2, 3, 4}.\nIf a set A has only one element, we call it a singleton set . Thus,{  a } is a\nsingleton set.\nExample 9   Consider the sets\nφ, A = { 1, 3 },   B = {1, 5, 9},   C = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}.\nInsert the symbol ⊂ or ⊄ between each of the following pair of sets:\n(i)  φ . . . B (ii) A . . . B (iii) A . . . C (iv) B . . . C\nSolution (i) φ ⊂ B as φ is a subset of every set.\n(ii) A ⊄ B as 3 ∈ \nA and 3 ∉ B\n(iii) A ⊂ C as 1, 3 ∈ A also belongs to C\n(iv) B  ⊂ C as each element of B is also an element of C.\nExample 10   Let A = { a, e, i, o, u} and B = { a, b, c, d }. Is A a subset of B ? No.\n(Why?). Is B a subset of  A? No. (Why?)\nExample 1 1 Let A, B and C be three sets. If A ∈ B and B ⊂ C, is it true that\nA ⊂ C?. If not, give an example.\nSolution   No. Let A = {1}, B  = {{1}, 2} and C = {{1}, 2, 3}. Here A\n ∈ B as A = {1}\nand B ⊂ C. But A ⊄ C as 1 ∈ A and 1 ∉ C.\nNote that an element of a set can never be a subset of itself.\n1.6.1  Subsets of set of real numbers\nAs noted in Section 1.6, there are many important subsets of R. We give below the\nnames of some of these subsets.\nThe set of natural numbers  N= {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, . . .}\nThe set of integers Z= {. . ., –3, –2, –1, 0, 1, 2, 3, . . .}\nThe set of rational numbers Q= { x : x = p\nq , p, q ∈  Z and q ≠ 0}\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSETS        11\nwhich is read “ Q is the set of all numbers x  such that x equals the quotient  p\nq, where\np and q  are integers and q is not zero”. Members of Q include  –5 (which can be\nexpressed  as 5\n1–) , 75, 132    (which can be expressed as 7\n2) and 11\n3–.\nThe set of irrational numbers, denoted by T, is composed of all other real numbers.\nThus T = {x :  x ∈ R and x ∉ Q}, i.e., all real numbers that are not rational.\nMembers of T include  2 , 5 and π.\nSome of the obvious relations among these subsets are:\nN  ⊂  Z ⊂ Q, Q ⊂ R, T ⊂ R, N ⊄ T.\n1.6.2  Intervals as subsets of R  Let a, b ∈ R and \na < b. Then the set of real numbers\n{ y : a < y < b } is called an open inter val and is denoted by ( a, b). All the points\nbetween  a and b belong to the open interval ( a, b) but a, b themselves do not belong to\nthis interval.\nThe interval which contains the end points also is called closed interval  and is\ndenoted by [  a, b ]. Thus\n[ a, b ] = { x : a ≤ x ≤ b}\nWe can also have intervals closed at one end and open at the other , i.e.,\n[ a, b ) = {x : a ≤ x < b} is an open interval  from a to b, including a but excluding b.\n( a, b ] = { x : a < x ≤  b } is an open interval  from a to b including b but excluding a.\nThese notations provide an alternative way of designating the subsets of set of\nreal numbers. For example , if A = (–3, 5) and B = [–7, 9], then A ⊂ B. The set [ 0, ∞)\ndefines the set of non-negative real numbers, while set ( – ∞, 0 ) defines the set of\nnegative real numbers. The set ( – ∞, ∞ ) describes the set of real numbers in relation\nto a line extending from – ∞ to ∞.\nOn real number line, various types of intervals described above as subsets of  R,\nare shown in the Fig 1.1.\nHere, we note that an interval contains infinitely many points.\nFor example, the set { x : x ∈ R, –5 < x ≤ 7}, written in set-builder form, can be\nwritten in the form of interval as (–5, 7] and the interval [–3, 5) can be written in set-\nbuilder form as { x : –3 ≤ x < 5}.Fig 1.1\nReprint 2025-26\n\n12       MA THEMA TICS\nThe number ( b – a ) is called the length of any of the intervals  (a, b), [a, b],\n[a, b)  or ( a, b].\n1.7  Universal Set\nUsually , in a particular context, we have to deal with the elements and subsets of a\nbasic set which is relevant to that particular context.  For example, while studying the\nsystem of numbers, we are interested in the set of natural numbers and its subsets such\nas the set of all prime numbers, the set of all even numbers, and so forth. This basic set\nis called the “Universal Set ”.  The universal set is usually denoted by U, and all its\nsubsets by the letters A, B, C, etc.\nFor example, for the set of all integers, the universal set can be the set of rational\nnumbers or , for that matter , the set R of real numbers. For another example, in human\npopulation studies, the universal set consists of all the people in the world.\nEXERCISE 1.3\n1.

Venn diagrams are named after\nthe English logician, John Venn (1834-1883). These\ndiagrams consist of rectangles and  closed curves\nusually circles. The universal set is represented\nusually by a rectangle and its subsets by circles.\nIn Venn diagrams, the elements of the sets are\nwritten in their respective circles (Figs 1.2 and 1.3)\nIllustration 1 In Fig 1.2, U = {1,2,3, ..., 10} is the\nuniversal set of which\nA = {2,4,6,8,10} is a subset.\nIllustration 2 In Fig 1.3, U = {1,2,3, ..., 10} is the\nuniversal set of which\nA = {2,4,6,8,10} and B = {4, 6} are subsets,\nand also B ⊂ A.\nThe reader will see an extensive use of the\nVenn diagrams when we discuss the union, intersection and dif ference of sets.\n1.9  Operations on Sets\nIn earlier classes, we have learnt how to perform the operations of addition, subtraction,\nmultiplication and division on numbers. Each one of these operations was performed\non a pair of numbers to get another number . For example, when we perform the\noperation of addition on the pair of numbers 5 and 13, we get the number 18. Again,\nperforming the operation of multiplication on the pair of numbers 5 and 13, we get 65.Fig 1.2\nFig 1.3\nReprint 2025-26\n\n14       MA THEMA TICS\nSimilarly , there are some operations which when performed on two sets give rise to\nanother set. We will now define certain operations on sets and examine their properties.\nHenceforth, we will refer all our sets as subsets of some universal set.\n1.9.1  Union of set s  Let A and B be any two sets. The union of  A and B is the set\nwhich consists of all the elements of A and all the elements of B, the common elements\nbeing taken only once. The symbol ‘ ∪’ is used to denote the union . Symbolically , we\nwrite \nA ∪ B and usually r ead as ‘A union B ’.\nExample 12  Let A = { 2, 4, 6, 8} and B = { 6, 8, 10, 12}. Find A\n ∪ B.\nSolution  We have  A\n ∪ B  = { 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12}\nNote that the common elements 6 and 8 have been taken only once while writing\nA ∪ B.\nExample 13   Let A = { a, e, i, o, u } and B = { a, i, u \n}. Show that A ∪ B  = A\nSolution  We have, A\n ∪ B = { a, e, i, o, u } = A.\nThis example illustrates that union of sets A and its subset B is the set A\nitself, i.e., if B ⊂ A, then A\n ∪ B = A.\nExample 14  Let X = {Ram, Geeta, Akbar} be the set of students of Class XI, who are\nin school hockey team. Let Y = {Geeta, David, Ashok} be the set of students from\nClass XI who are in the school football team. Find X ∪ Y and interpret the set.\nSolution We have, X ∪ \nY = {Ram, Geeta, Akbar , David, Ashok}. This is the set of\nstudents from Class XI who are in the hockey team or the football team or both.\nThus, we can define the union of two sets as follows:\nDefinition 5  The union of two sets A and B is the set C which consists of all those\nelements which are either in A or in B (including\nthose which are in both). In symbols, we write.\nA ∪ B  = { x : x ∈A or x ∈B }\nThe union of two sets can be represented by\na Venn diagram as shown in Fig 1.4.\nThe shaded portion in Fig 1.4 represents A ∪ B.\nSome Properties of the Operation of Union\n(i)A ∪ B  = B ∪ A  (Commutative law)\n(ii) ( A\n ∪ B ) ∪ C = A ∪ ( B ∪ C)\n     (Associative law )\n(iii) A ∪ φ = A      (Law of identity element, φ is the identity of ∪)Fig 1.4\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSETS        15\n(iv) A ∪ A   = A     (Idempotent law)\n(v) U ∪ A  = U      (Law of U)\n1.9.2  Intersection of set s  The intersection of sets A and B is the set of all elements\nwhich are common to both A and B.  The symbol ‘ ∩’ is used to denote the intersection .\nThe intersection of two sets A and B is the set of all those elements which belong to\nboth A and B. Symbolically , we write A ∩ B = { x :  x ∈ A and \nx ∈ B}.\nExample 15 Consider the sets A and B of Example 12. Find A ∩ B.\nSolution We see that 6, 8 are the only elements which are common to both A and B.\nHence  A\n ∩ B = { 6, 8 }.\nExample 16  Consider the sets X and Y of Example 14. Find X ∩ Y.\nSolution\n We see that element ‘Geeta’  is the only element common to both. Hence,\nX ∩ Y = {Geeta}.\nExample 17 Let A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10} and B = { 2, 3, 5, 7 }. Find A  ∩ B and\nhence show that A ∩ B = B.\nSolution\n We have A ∩ B = { 2, 3, 5, 7 } = B. We\nnote that B ⊂ A and that A\n ∩ B = B.\nDefinition 6  The intersection of two sets A and B\nis the set of all those elements which belong to both\nA and B. Symbolically , we write\nA ∩ B = { x : x ∈ A and x ∈ B}\nThe shaded portion in Fig 1.5 indicates the\nintersection of A and B.\nIf \nA and B are two sets such that A ∩ B =  φ,  then\nA and B are called disjoint sets.\nFor example, let A = { 2, 4, 6, 8 } and\nB = { 1, 3, 5, 7 }. Then A and B are disjoint sets,\nbecause there are no elements which are common to\nA and B.  The disjoint sets can be represented by\nmeans of Venn diagram as shown in the Fig 1.6\nIn the above diagram, A and B are disjoint sets.\nSome Properties of Operation of Intersection\n(i)A ∩ B  = B ∩ A (Commutative law).\n(ii)( A  \n∩ B ) ∩ C = A ∩ ( B ∩ C ) (Associative law).\n(iii) φ ∩ A = φ, U ∩  A = A (Law of φ  and U).\n(iv) A ∩ A = A (Idempotent law)Fig 1.5\nA BU\nFig 1.6\nReprint 2025-26\n\n16       MA THEMA TICS\n(v) A ∩ ( B ∪ C )   =  ( A ∩ B ) ∪  ( A ∩ C ) (Distributive law ) i. e.,\n∩ distributes over ∪\nThis can be seen  easily from the following Venn diagrams [Figs 1.7 (i) to (v)].\n(i) (iii)\n(ii) (iv)\n(v)\nFigs  1.7 (i) to (v)\n1.9.3  Difference of set s  The dif ference of the sets A and B in this order is the set\nof elements which belong to A but  not to B. Symbolically , we write A – B and read as\n“A minus B”.\nExample 18   Let A = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, B = { 2, 4, 6, 8 }. Find A – B and B – A.\nSolution\n We have, A – B = { 1, 3, 5 }, since the elements 1, 3, 5 belong to A but\nnot to B and B – A = { 8 }, since the element 8 belongs to B and not to A.\nWe note that A – B ≠ B – A.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSETS        17\nFig 1.8\nFig 1.9Example 19 Let V = {  a, e, i, o, u  } and\nB = { a, i, k, u }. Find V – B and B – V\nSolution   \nWe have, V  – B = { e, o }, since the elements\ne, o belong to V but not to B and B – V = { k }, since\nthe element k belongs to B but not to V\n.\nWe note that V – B ≠ B – V.  Using the set-\nbuilder notation, we can rewrite the definition of\ndifference as\nA – B = { x : x ∈ A and x ∉ B }\nThe dif ference of two sets A and B can be\nrepresented by Venn diagram as shown in Fig 1.8.\nThe shaded portion represents the difference of\nthe two sets A and B.\nRemark  The sets A – B, A ∩ B and B – A are\nmutually disjoint sets, i.e., the intersection of any of\nthese two sets is the null set as shown in Fig 1.9.\nEXERCISE 1.4\n1.Find the union of each of the following pairs of sets :\n(i)X = {1, 3, 5} Y = {1, 2, 3}\n(ii) A =  [ a, e, i, o, u }B = {\na, b, c }\n(iii) A = {x : x is a natural number and multiple of 3}\nB = { x : x is a natural number less than 6}\n(iv) A = { x : x is a natural number and 1 < x ≤6 }\nB = { x : x is a natural number and 6 < x < 10 }\n(v) A = {1, 2, 3}, B = φ\n2.Let A = { a, b }, B =  { a, b, c }.

Thus,\n A = {x : x ∈  U and x is not a divisor of 42 }. We see that 2 ∈ U but 2 ∉ A, because\n2 is divisor of 42. Similarly , 3 ∈ U but 3 ∉ A, and 7 ∈ U but 7 ∉ A. Now 2, 3 and 7 are\nthe only elements of U which do not belong to A. The set of these three prime numbers,\ni.e., the set {2, 3, 7} is called the Complement  of A with respect to U, and is  denoted by\nA′. So we have   A′ = {2, 3, 7}. Thus, we see that\nA′  = {x : x ∈ U and \nx ∉ A }. This leads to the following definition.\nDefinition 7 Let U be the universal set and A a subset of U. Then the complement of\nA is the set of all elements of U which are not the elements of A. Symbolically , we\nwrite A′ to denote  the complement of A with respect to U. Thus,\nA′ = {x : x ∈ U and x ∉ A }. Obviously A′ = U – A\nWe note that the complement of a set A can be looked upon, alternatively , as the\ndifference between a universal set U and the set A.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSETS        19\nExample  20 Let U =  {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10} and A = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}. Find A′.\nSolution   We note that 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 are the only elements of U which do not belong to\nA. Hence  \nA′ = { 2, 4, 6, 8,10 }.\nExample 21 Let U be universal set of all the students of Class XI of a coeducational\nschool and A be the set of all girls in Class XI. Find A′.\nSolution\n Since A is the set of all girls, A′ is clearly the set of all boys in the class.\nANote    If A is a subset of the universal set U, then its complement A′  is also a\nsubset of U.\nAgain in Example 20 above, we have  A′= { 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 }\nHence              (A ′)′= {x : x ∈ U and x ∉ A′}\n= {1, 3, 5, 7, 9} = A\nIt is clear from the definition of the complement that for any subset of the universal\nset U, we have          ( A′)′ = A\nNow , we want to find the results for ( A ∪ B )′ and A′ ∩ B′ in the followng\nexample.\nExample 22  Let U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, A = {2, 3} and B = {3, 4, 5}.\nFind A′, B′ ,  A′  ∩ B′, A\n ∪ B and hence show that (  A ∪ B )′ = A′ ∩ B′.\nSolution  Clearly A′ = {1, 4, 5, 6}, B ′ = { 1, 2, 6 }. Hence A′ ∩ B′ = { 1, 6 }\nAlso A ∪ B  = { 2, 3, 4, 5 }, so that (A  ∪ B)′  = { 1, 6 }\n    ( A ∪ B )′ = { 1, 6 } =  A′ ∩ B′\nIt can be shown that the above result is true in general. If A and B are any two\nsubsets of the universal set U, then\n( A ∪ B )′  = A′ ∩ B′. Similarly , ( A ∩ B )′  =  A′  ∪ B′ . These two results are stated\nin words as follows :\nThe complement of the union of two sets is\nthe intersection of their complements and the\ncomplement of the intersection of two sets is the\nunion of their complements.  These are called De\nMor gan’ s laws . These are named after the\nmathematician De Morgan.\nThe complement A′ of a set A can be represented\nby a Venn diagram as shown in Fig 1.10.\nThe shaded portion represents the complement of the set A.Fig 1.10\nReprint 2025-26\n\n20       MA THEMA TICS\nSome Properties of Complement Sets\n1.

Thus,\n A = {x : x ∈  U and x is not a divisor of 42 }. We see that 2 ∈ U but 2 ∉ A, because\n2 is divisor of 42. Similarly , 3 ∈ U but 3 ∉ A, and 7 ∈ U but 7 ∉ A. Now 2, 3 and 7 are\nthe only elements of U which do not belong to A. The set of these three prime numbers,\ni.e., the set {2, 3, 7} is called the Complement  of A with respect to U, and is  denoted by\nA′. So we have   A′ = {2, 3, 7}. Thus, we see that\nA′  = {x : x ∈ U and \nx ∉ A }. This leads to the following definition.\nDefinition 7 Let U be the universal set and A a subset of U. Then the complement of\nA is the set of all elements of U which are not the elements of A. Symbolically , we\nwrite A′ to denote  the complement of A with respect to U. Thus,\nA′ = {x : x ∈ U and x ∉ A }. Obviously A′ = U – A\nWe note that the complement of a set A can be looked upon, alternatively , as the\ndifference between a universal set U and the set A.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSETS        19\nExample  20 Let U =  {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10} and A = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}. Find A′.\nSolution   We note that 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 are the only elements of U which do not belong to\nA. Hence  \nA′ = { 2, 4, 6, 8,10 }.\nExample 21 Let U be universal set of all the students of Class XI of a coeducational\nschool and A be the set of all girls in Class XI. Find A′.\nSolution\n Since A is the set of all girls, A′ is clearly the set of all boys in the class.\nANote    If A is a subset of the universal set U, then its complement A′  is also a\nsubset of U.\nAgain in Example 20 above, we have  A′= { 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 }\nHence              (A ′)′= {x : x ∈ U and x ∉ A′}\n= {1, 3, 5, 7, 9} = A\nIt is clear from the definition of the complement that for any subset of the universal\nset U, we have          ( A′)′ = A\nNow , we want to find the results for ( A ∪ B )′ and A′ ∩ B′ in the followng\nexample.\nExample 22  Let U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, A = {2, 3} and B = {3, 4, 5}.\nFind A′, B′ ,  A′  ∩ B′, A\n ∪ B and hence show that (  A ∪ B )′ = A′ ∩ B′.\nSolution  Clearly A′ = {1, 4, 5, 6}, B ′ = { 1, 2, 6 }. Hence A′ ∩ B′ = { 1, 6 }\nAlso A ∪ B  = { 2, 3, 4, 5 }, so that (A  ∪ B)′  = { 1, 6 }\n    ( A ∪ B )′ = { 1, 6 } =  A′ ∩ B′\nIt can be shown that the above result is true in general. If A and B are any two\nsubsets of the universal set U, then\n( A ∪ B )′  = A′ ∩ B′. Similarly , ( A ∩ B )′  =  A′  ∪ B′ . These two results are stated\nin words as follows :\nThe complement of the union of two sets is\nthe intersection of their complements and the\ncomplement of the intersection of two sets is the\nunion of their complements.

These\nare summarised below:\n®A set is a well-defined collection of objects.\n®A set which does not contain any element is called empty set .\n®A set which consists of a definite number of elements is called finite set ,\notherwise, the set is called infinite set .\n®Two sets A and B are said to be equal if they have exactly the same elements.\n®A set A is said to be subset of a set B, if every element of A is also an element\nof B. Intervals are subsets of R.\n®The union of two sets A and B is the set of all those elements which are either\nin A or in B.\n®The intersection of two sets A and B is the set of all elements which are\ncommon. The dif ference of two sets A and B in this order is the set of elements\nwhich belong to A but not to B.\n®The complement of a subset A of universal set U is the set of all elements of U\nwhich are not the elements of A.\n®For any two sets A and B, (A  ∪ B)′ = A′ ∩ B′ and ( A ∩ B )′ = A′ ∪ B′\nHistorical Note\nThe modern theory of sets is considered to have been originated largely by the\nGerman mathematician Georg Cantor (1845-1918). His papers on set theory\nappeared sometimes during 1874 to 1897. His study of set  theory came when he\nwas studying trigonometric series of the form a1 sin x + a2 sin 2 x + a3 sin 3\nx + ...\nHe published in a paper in 1874  that the set of real numbers could not be put into\none-to-one correspondence wih the integers. From 1879 onwards, he publishd\nseveral papers showing various properties of abstract sets.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSETS        23\nCantor ’s work was well received by another famous mathematician Richard\nDedekind (1831-1916). But Kronecker (1810-1893) castigated him for regarding\ninfinite set the same way as finite sets. Another German mathematician Gottlob\nFrege, at the turn of the century , presented the set theory as principles of logic.\nTill then the entire set theory was based on the assumption of the existence of the\nset of all sets. It was the famous Englih Philosopher Bertand Russell (1872-\n1970 ) who showed in 1902 that the assumption of existence of a set of all sets\nleads to a contradiction. This led to the famous Russell’ s Paradox. Paul R.Halmos\nwrites about it in his book ‘Naïve  Set Theory’ that “nothing contains everything”.\nThe Russell’ s Paradox was not the only one which arose in set theory .\nMany paradoxes were produced later by several mathematicians and logicians.\nAs a consequence of all these paradoxes, the first axiomatisation of set theory\nwas published in 1908 by Ernst Zermelo. Another one was proposed by Abraham\nFraenkel in 1922.  John Von Neumann in 1925  introduced explicitly the axiom of\nregularity . Later in 1937 Paul Bernays gave a set of more satisfactory\naxiomatisation. A modification of these axioms was done by Kurt Gödel in his\nmonograph in 1940. This was known as V on Neumann-Bernays (VNB) or Gödel-\nBernays (GB) set theory .\nDespite all these dif ficulties, Cantor ’s set theory is used in present day\nmathematics. In fact, these days most of the concepts and results in mathematics\nare expressed in the set theoretic language.\n \n—vvv\nvv—\nReprint 2025-26\n\n",
