Cauchy\n(1789-1857)\nReprint 2025-26\n\nAPPLICATION OF INTEGRALS         293\nFig  8.2This area is called the elementar y area which is located at an arbitrary position\nwithin the region which is specified by some value of x between a and b. We can think\nof the total area A of the region between x-axis, ordinates x = a, x = b and the curve\ny = f (x) as the result of adding up the elementary areas of thin strips across the region\nPQRSP . Symbolical ly, we express\nA = A ( )b b b\na a ad ydx f x dx= =∫ ∫ ∫\nThe area A of the region bounded by\nthe curve x = g (y), y-axis and the lines y  =  c,\ny = d is given by\nA = ( )d d\nc cxdy g y dy=∫ ∫\nHere, we consider horizontal strips as shown in\nthe Fig 8.2\nRem ark If the position of the curve under consideration is below the x-axis, then since\nf(x) < 0 from x = a to x = b, as shown in Fig 8.3, the area bounded by the curve, x-axis\nand the ordinates x = a, x  = b come out to be negative. But, it is only the numerical\nvalue of the area whic h is taken into consideration. Thus, if the area is negative, we\ntake its absolute value, i.e., ( )b\naf x dx∫.\nFig 8.3\nGenerally , it may happen that some portion of the curve is above x-axis and some is\nbelow the x-axis as shown in the Fig 8.4. Here, A1 < 0 and A2 > 0. Therefore, the area\nA bounded by the curve y = f (x), x-axis and the ordinates x = a and x = b is given\nby A = |A1| + A2.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n294 MATHEMA TICS\nExample 1  Find the area enclosed by the circle x2 + y2 = a2.\nSolution From Fig 8.5, the whole area enclosed\nby the given circle\n= 4 (area of the region AOBA  bounded by\nthe curve, x-axis and the ordinates x = 0 and\nx = a) [as the circle is symmetrical about both\nx-axis and y-axis]\n= 04aydx∫  (taking vertical strips)\n= 2 2\n04aa x dx−∫\nSince x2 + y2 = a2 gives     y = 2 2a x± −\nAs the region AOBA  lies in the first quadrant, y  is taken as positive.

This method arose in the solution of problems\non calculating areas of plane figures, surface areas and volumes of solid bodies\netc. In this sense, the method of exhaustion can be regarded as an early method\nReprint 2025-26\n\nAPPLICATION OF INTEGRALS         299\nof integration. The greatest development of method of exhaustion in the early\nperiod was obtained in the works of Eudoxus (440 B.C.) and Archimedes\n(300 B.C.)\nSystematic approach to the theory of Calculus began in the 17th century .\nIn 1665, Newton began his work on the Calculus described by him as the theory\nof fluxions and used his theory in finding the tangent and radius of curvature at\nany point on a curve. Newton introduced the basic notion of inverse function\ncalled the anti derivative (indefinite integral) or the inverse method of tangents.\nDuring 1684-86, Leibnitz published an article in the Acta Eruditorum  which\nhe called Calculas summatorius , since it was connected with the summation of\na number of infinitely small areas, whose sum, he indicated by the symbol ‘ ∫’. In\n1696, he followed a suggestion made by J. Bernoulli and changed this article to\nCalculus integrali. This corresponded to Newton’ s inverse method of tangents.\nBoth Newton and Leibnitz adopted quite independent lines of approach which\nwas radically dif ferent. However , respective theories accomplished results that\nwere practically identical. Leibnitz used the notion of definite integral and what is\nquite certain is that he first clearly appreciated tie up between the antiderivative\nand the definite integral.\nConclusively , the fundamental concepts and theory of Integral Calculus and\nprimarily its relationships with Differential Calculus were developed in the work\nof P.de Fermat, I. Newton and G . Leibnitz at the end of 17th century . However ,\nthis justification by the concept of limit was only developed in the works of A.L.\nCauchy in the early 19th century . Lastly , it is worth mentioning the following\nquotation by Lie Sophie’ s:\n“It may be said that the conceptions of differential quotient and integral which\nin their origin certainly go back to Archimedes were introduced in Science by the\ninvestigations of Kepler , Descartes, Cavalieri, Fermat and Wallis .... The discovery\nthat differentiation and integration are inverse operations belongs to Newton\nand Leibnitz”.\n—/xrhombus/xrhombus/xrhombus/xrhombus/xrhombus—\nReprint 2025-26\n\n",
