      "content": "1. Impossible and Sure Events\n  The empty set φ and the sample space S describe\nevents. In fact φ is called an impossible event  and S, i.e., the whole sample space is\ncalled the sure event .\nTo understand these let us consider the experiment of rolling a die. The associated\nsample space is\nS = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\nLet E be the event “ the number appears on the die is a multiple of 7”. Can you\nwrite the subset associated with the event E?\nClearly no outcome satisfies the condition given in the event, i.e., no element of\nthe sample space ensures the occurrence of the event E. Thus, we say that the empty\nset only correspond to the event E. In other words we can say that it is impossible to\nhave a multiple of 7 on the upper face of the die. Thus, the event E = φ is an impossible\nevent.\nNow let us take up another event F “the number turns up is odd or even”. Clearly\nF = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,} = S, i.e., all outcomes of the experiment ensure the occurrence of\nthe event F . Thus, the event F = S is a sure event.\n",

Compound Event   If an event has more than one sample point, it is called  a\nCompound event .\nFor example, in the experiment of “tossing a coin thrice” the events\nE: ‘Exactly one head appeared’\nF: ‘Atleast one head appeared’\nG: ‘Atmost one head appeared’ etc.\nare all compound events. The subsets of S associated with these events are\nE={HTT ,THT ,TTH}\nF={HTT ,THT , TTH, HHT , HTH, THH, HHH}\nG= {TTT , THT , HTT , TTH}\nEach of the above subsets contain more than one sample point, hence they are all\ncompound events.\n14.1.3  Algebra of event s  In the Chapter on Sets, we have studied about dif ferent\nways of combining two or more sets, viz, union, intersection, difference, complement\nof a set etc. Like-wise we can combine two or more events by using the analogous set\nnotations.\nLet A, B, C be events associated with an experiment whose sample space is S.\n1. Complementar y Event  For every event A, there corresponds another event\nA′called the complementary event to A. It is also called the event ‘not A’.\nFor example, take the experiment ‘of tossing three coins’. An associated sample\nspace is\nS = {HHH, HHT , HTH, THH, HTT , THT, TTH, TTT}\nLet  A={HTH, HHT , THH} be the event ‘only one tail appears’\nClearly for the outcome HTT , the event A has not occurred. But we may say that\nthe event ‘not A’ has occurred. Thus, with every outcome which is not in A, we say\nthat ‘not A\n’ occurs.\nThus t he complementary event ‘not A’ to the event A is\nA′ = {HHH, HTT , THT , TTH, TTT}\nor A′ = {ω : ω ∈ S and ω∉A} = S – A.\n2. The Event ‘A  or B’ Recall that union of two sets A and B denoted by A ∪ B\ncontains all those elements which are either in A  or in B or in both.\nWhen the sets A and B are two events associated with a sample space, then\n‘A ∪ B’ is the event ‘either A or B or both’. This event ‘A  ∪ B’ is also called ‘A  or B’.\nTherefore Event ‘A or B’ = A ∪ B\n={\nω : ω ∈ A or ω∈ B}\nReprint 2025-26\n\n292 MATHEMA TICS\n3. The Event ‘A  and B’  We know that intersection of two sets A  ∩ B is the set of\nthose elements which are common to both A and B. i.e., which belong to both\n‘A and B’.\nIf A and B are two events, then the set A\n ∩ B denotes the event ‘A  and B’.\nThus,       A ∩ B = {ω : ω ∈ A and ω ∈ B}\nFor example, in the experiment of ‘throwing a die twice’  Let A be the event\n‘score on the first throw is six’  and B is the event ‘sum of two scores is atleast 1 1’ then\nA ={(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)}, and  B = {(5,6), (6,5), (6,6)}\nso A ∩ B ={(6,5), (6,6)}\nNote that the set A ∩ B = {(6,5), (6,6)} may represent the event ‘the score on the first\nthrow  is six and the sum of the scores is atleast 1 1’.\n",

Consider events, A ‘an odd number appears’  and B ‘an even\nnumber appears’\nClearly the event A excludes the event B and vice versa. In other words, there is\nno outcome which ensures the occurrence of events A and B simultaneously . Here\nA = {1, 3, 5} and B = {2, 4, 6}\nClearly A ∩ B = φ,  i.e., A and B are disjoint sets.\nIn general, two events A and B are called mutually exclusive  events if the\noccurrence of any one of them excludes the occurrence of the other event, i.e., if they\ncan not occur simultaneously . In this case the sets A and B are disjoint.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n  PROBABILITY            293\nAgain in the experiment of rolling a die, consider the events A ‘an odd number\nappears’ and event B ‘a number less than 4 appears’\nObviously A = {1, 3, 5} and B = {1, 2, 3}\nNow 3 ∈ A  as well as 3 ∈ B\nTherefore,  A and B are not mutually exclusive events.\nRemark  Simple events of a sample space are always mutually exclusive.\n14.1.5 Exhaustive event s Consider the experiment of throwing a die. We have\nS = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. Let us define the following events\nA: ‘a number less than 4 appears’,\nB: ‘a number greater than 2 but less than 5 appears’\nand C: ‘a number greater than 4 appears’.\nThen A = {1, 2, 3}, B = {3,4} and C = {5, 6}. We observe that\nA ∪ B ∪ C = {1, 2, 3}  ∪ {3, 4}  ∪ {5, 6} = S.\nSuch events A, B and C are called exhaustive events. In general, if E1, E2, ..., En are \nn\nevents of a sample space S and if\n1 2 31E E E E E Sn\nn ii...\n=∪ ∪ ∪ ∪ = ∪ =\nthen E1, E2, ...., En are called exhaustive events .In other words, events E1, E2, ..., En\nare said to be exhaustive if atleast one of them necessarily occurs whenever the\nexperiment is performed.\nFurther , if Ei ∩ Ej = φ for i ≠ j  i.e., events Ei and Ej are pairwise disjoint and\nS E\n1= ∪\n=in\ni, then events E1, E2, ..., En are called mutually exclusive and exhaustive\nevents .\nWe now consider some examples.\nExample 2  \nTwo dice are thrown and the sum of the numbers which come up on the\ndice is noted. Let us consider the following events associated with this experiment\nA: ‘the sum is even’.\nB: ‘the sum is a multiple of 3’.\nC: ‘the sum is less than 4’.\nD: ‘the sum is greater than 1 1’.\nWhich pairs of these events are mutually exclusive?\nReprint 2025-26\n\n294 MATHEMA TICS\nSolution There are 36 elements in the sample space S = {( x, y):  x, y = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\nThen\nA = {(1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 2), (4, 4),\n       (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 6)}\nB = {(1, 2), (2, 1), (1, 5), (5, 1), (3, 3), (2, 4), (4, 2), (3, 6), (6, 3), (4, 5), (5, 4),\n       (6, 6)}\nC = {(1, 1), (2, 1), (1, 2)} and D = {(6, 6)}\nWe find that\nA ∩ B = {(1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2), (5, 1), (6, 6)} ≠ φ\nTherefore,  A and B are not mutually exclusive events.\nSimilarly A ∩ C ≠ φ, A ∩ D \n≠ φ, B ∩ C ≠ φ and B ∩ D ≠ φ.\nThus, the pairs of events, (A, C), (A, D), (B, C), (B, D) are not mutually exclusive\nevents.\nAlso C ∩ D = φ  and so C and D are mutually exclusive events.\nExample 3  A coin is tossed three times, consider the following events.\nA: ‘No head appears’, B: ‘Exactly one head appears’ and C: ‘Atleast two heads\nappear ’.\nDo they form a set of mutually exclusive and exhaustive events?\nSolution The sample space of the experiment is\nS = {HHH, HHT , HTH, THH, HTT , THT, TTH, TTT}\nand A = {TTT}, B = {HTT , THT, TTH}, C = {HHT , HTH, THH, HHH}\nNow\nA ∪ B ∪ C = {TTT , HTT , THT , TTH, HHT , HTH, THH, HHH} = S\nTherefore,   A, B and C are exhaustive events.\nAlso, A\n ∩ B = φ, A ∩ C = φ and B ∩ C = φ\nTherefore, the events are pair-wise disjoint, i.e., they are mutually exclusive.\nHence, A, B and C form a set of mutually exclusive and exhaustive events.\nEXERCISE 14.1\n1.A die is rolled.

In our day to day life we use many words\nabout the chances of occurrence of events. Probability theory attempts to quantify\nthese chances of occurrence or non occurrence of events.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n296 MATHEMA TICS\nIn earlier classes, we have studied some methods of assigning probability to an\nevent associated with an experiment having known the number of total outcomes.\nAxiomatic approach is another way of describing probability of an event. In this\napproach some axioms or rules are depicted to assign probabilities.\nLet S be the sample space of a random experiment. The probability P is a real\nvalued function whose domain is the power set of S and range is the interval [0,1]\nsatisfying the following axioms\n(i)For any event E,  P  (E) ≥0 (ii) P (S) = 1\n(iii) If E and F are mutually exclusive events, then P(E ∪ F) = P(E) + P(F).\nIt follows from (iii) that P( φ) = 0. To prove this, we take F = φ and note that E and φ\nare disjoint events. Therefore, from axiom (iii), we get\nP (E ∪ φ) = P (E) + P ( φ)or P(E) = P(E) + P ( φ) i.e. P ( φ) = 0.\nLet S be a sample space containing outcomes 1 2, ,...,n ω ω ω , i.e.,\nS = { ω1, ω2, ..., ωn}\nIt follows from the axiomatic definition of probability that\n(i)0 ≤ P (ωi) ≤ 1 for each ωi ∈ S\n(ii) P (ω1) + P ( ω2) + ... + P ( ωn) = 1\n(iii) For any event A, P(A) = ∑ P(ωi ), ωi ∈ A.\nANote    It may be noted that the singleton { ωi} is called elementary event and\nfor notational convenience, we write P( ωi ) for P({ ωi }).\nFor example, in ‘a coin tossing’ experiment we can assign the number 1\n2 to each\nof the outcomes H and T.\ni.e. P(H) = 1\n2 and P(T) = 1\n2\n(1)\nClearly this assignment satisfies both the conditions i.e., each number is neither\nless than zero nor greater than 1 and\nP(H) + P(T) = 21 + 21 = 1\nTherefore, in this case we can say that probability of H = 21, and probability of T = 21\nIf we take P(H) = 41 and P(T) = 43... (2)\nReprint 2025-26\n\n  PROBABILITY            297\nDoes this assignment satisfy the conditions of axiomatic approach?\nYes, in this case, probability of H = 1\n4 and probability of T = 43.\nWe find that both the assignments (1) and (2) are valid for probability of\nH and T.\nIn fact, we can assign the numbers p and (1 – \np) to both the outcomes such that\n0 ≤ p ≤ 1 and P(H) + P(T) = p  + (1 –  p ) = 1\nThis assignment, too, satisfies both conditions of the axiomatic approach of\nprobability . Hence, we can say that there are many ways (rather infinite) to assign\nprobabilities to outcomes of an experiment. We now consider some examples.\nExample 4  Let a sample space be S = { ω1, ω2,..., ω6}.Which of the following\nassignments of probabilities to each outcome are valid?\nOutcomes ω1ω2ω3ω4ω5ω6\n(a)61\n61\n61\n61\n61\n61\n(b)  1 0 0 0 0 0\n(c)81\n32\n31\n31\n41−31−\n(d)121\n121\n61\n61\n61\n23\n(e) 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6\nSolution (a)Condition (i): Each of the number p( ωi) is positive and less than one.\nCondition (ii): Sum of probabilities\n= 161\n61\n61\n61\n61\n61= + + + + +\nTherefore, the assignment is valid\n(b) Condition (i): Each of the number p(ωi) is either 0 or 1.\nCondition (ii) Sum of the probabilities = 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1\nTherefore,  the assignment is valid\n(c) Condition (i) Two of the probabilities p(ω5) and p(ω6) are negative, the assignment\nis not valid\n(d) Since p(ω6) = 3\n2> 1, the assignment is not valid\nReprint 2025-26\n\n298 MATHEMA TICS\n(e) Since,  sum of probabilities = 0.1 + 0.2 + 0.3 + 0.4 + 0.5 + 0.6 = 2.1, the assignment\nis not valid.\n14.2.1  Probability of an event Let S be a sample space associated with the experiment\n‘examining three consecutive pens produced by a machine and classified as Good\n(non-defective) and bad (defective)’.

It had its origin in the 16th century when an Italian\nphysician and mathematician Jerome Cardan (1501–1576) wrote the first book\non the subject “Book on Games of Chance” (Biber de Ludo Aleae). It was\npublished in 1663 after his death.\nIn 1654, a gambler Chevalier de Metre approached the well known French\nPhilosopher and Mathematician Blaise Pascal (1623–1662) for certain dice\nproblem. Pascal became interested in these problems and discussed with famous\nFrench Mathematician Pierre de Fermat (1601–1665). Both Pascal and Fermat\nsolved the problem independently . Besides, Pascal and Fermat, outstanding\ncontributions to probability theory were also made by Christian Huygenes (1629–\n1665), a Dutchman, J. Bernoulli (1654–1705), De Moivre (1667–1754), a\nFrenchman Pierre Laplace (1749–1827), the Russian P .L Chebyshev (1821–\n1897), A. A Markov (1856–1922) and A. N Kolmogorove (1903–1987).\nKolmogorov is credited with the axiomatic theory of probability . His book\n‘Foundations of Probability’ published in 1933, introduces probability as a set\nfunction and is considered a classic.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n",
