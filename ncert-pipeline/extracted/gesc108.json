[Fig. 8.9 (a)].Anther contains pollen grains which\nproduce male gametes . A pistil consists\nof stigma, style and ovary. Ovary\ncontains one or more ovules. The\nfemale gamete or the  egg is formed in\nan ovule [Fig. 8.9 (b)].

Some of\nthe pollen lands on the stigma of a flowerof the same kind. The transfer of pollen\nfrom the anther to the stigma of a flower\nis called pollination .  If the pollen lands\non the stigma of the same flower or\nanother flower of the same plant, it is\ncalled self-pollination. When the pollenof a flower lands on the stigma of a flower\nof a different plant of the same kind, it\nis called cross-pollination  [Fig. 8.10 (a)\nand (b)].\nFertilisation\nThe cell which results after fusion of\nthe gametes is called a zygote .

Is it to attract\ninsects?\nFig. 8.12  (a) Section of an apple, (b) Almond\ngametes (to form a zygote) is calledfertilisation (Fig. 8.11). The zygote\ndevelops into an embryo.\n8.3 F RUITS AND SEED FORMATION\nAfter fertilisation, the ovary grows intoa fruit and other parts of the flower fall\noff. The fruit is the ripened ovary. The\nseeds develop from the ovules. The seedcontains an embryo enclosed in a\nprotective seed coat.\nSome fruits are fleshy and juicy such\nas mango and orange. Some fruits arehard like almonds and walnuts\n[Fig. 8.12 (a) and (b)].\n8.4 S EED DISPERSAL\nIn nature same kind of plants grow atdifferent places. This happens because\nseeds are dispersed to different places .\nSometimes after a walk through a forest\nor a field or a park, you may have found\nseeds or fruits sticking to your clothes.Fig. 8.11  Fertilisation (Zygote formation)\nPollen grain (germinating)\nOvumZygote\nformation\nPollen tube\n(a)(b)(a)\n(b)\nReprint 2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 88Did you try to observe how these seeds\nwere clinging to your clothes?\nWhat do you think will happen if all\nseeds of a plant were to fall at the sameplace and grow there? There would besevere competition for sunlight, water,\nminerals and space. As a result the seeds\nwould not grow into healthy plants.Plants benefit by seed dispersal. It\nprevents competition between the plant\nand its own seedlings for sunlight, waterand minerals. It also enables the plants\nto invade new habitats for wider\ndistribution.\nSeeds and fruits of plants are carried\naway by wind, water and animals.Winged seeds such as those of drumstickand maple [Fig. 8.13 (a) and (b)], lightseeds of grasses or hairy seeds of aak(Madar ) and hairy fruit of sunflower\n[Fig. 8.14 (a), (b)], get blown off with the\nwind to far away places. Some seeds are\ndispersed by water. These fruits or seedsusually develop floating ability in the\nform of spongy or fibrous outer coat as\nin coconut. Some seeds are dispersed byanimals, especially spiny seeds with\nhooks which get attached to the bodies\nof animals and are carried to distantplaces. Examples are Xanthium\n(Fig. 8.15) and Urena .\nSome seeds are dispersed when the\nfruits burst with sudden jerks. The seeds\nare scattered far from the parent plant.\nThis happens in the case of castor andbalsam.\nFig. 8.13  Seeds of (a) drumstick and\n(b) maple\nFig. 8.15  XanthiumFig. 8.14  (a) The hairy fruit of sunflower and\n(b) hairy seed of madar (aak)\nSeed\nWing\n(a) (b) (a) (b)\nReprint 2024-25\n\nREPRODUCTION  IN PLANTS 89\nWhat you have learnt\nAll organisms multiply or reproduce their own kind.\nIn plants there are two modes of reproduction, asexual and sexual.\nThere are several methods of asexual reproduction such as\nfragmentation, budding, spore formation and vegetative propagation.\nSexual reproduction involves the fusion of male and female gametes.\nIn vegetative propagation new plants are produced from differentvegetative parts such as leaves, stems and roots.\nFlower is the reproductive part of a plant.\nA flower may be unisexual with either the male or the female reproductiveparts.\nA bisexual flower has both the male and the female reproductive parts.\nThe male gametes are found inside the pollen grains and female gametesare found in the ovule.\nPollination is the process of transfer of pollen grains from the anther ofone flower to the stigma of the same or another flower.\nPollination is of two types, self-pollination and cross-pollination. Inself-pollination, pollen grains are transferred from the anther to thestigma of the same flower. In cross-pollination, pollen grains aretransferred from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flowerof the same kind.\nPollination takes place in plants with the help of wind, water and insects.\nThe fusion of male and female gametes is called fertilisation.\nFertilised egg is called zygote. Zygote develops into an embryo.\nFruit is the mature ovary whereas ovule develops into a seed, whichcontains the developing embryo.\nSeed dispersal is aided by wind, water and animals.\nSeed dispersal helps the plants to (i) prevent overcrowding, (ii) avoidcompetition for sunlight, water and minerals and (iii) invade new habitats.Keywords\nAsexual reproduction\nBuddingEmbryoFertilisationFragmentationGametesHyphaOvulePollen grainPollen tubePollinationSeed dispersalSexual reproductionSporeSporangiumVegetative propagationZygote\nReprint 2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 90Exercises\n1.
