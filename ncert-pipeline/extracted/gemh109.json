What length of a tape is required\nto wrap once around the pipe ( π = 3.14)?\nSOLUTION Radius of the pipe ( r) = 10 cm\nLength of tape required is equal to the circumference of the pipe.\nCircumference of the pipe = 2πr\n=2 × 3.14 × 10 cm\n=62.8 cm\nTherefore, length of the tape needed to wrap once around the pipe is 62.8 cm.\nEXAMPLE  10Find the perimeter of the given shape (Fig 9.23) (T ake π = 22\n7).\nSOLUTION In this shape we need to find the circumference of semicircles on each side\nof the square. Do you need to find the perimeter of the square also? No.\nThe outer boundary , of this figure is made up of semicircles. Diameter of\neach semicircle is 14 cm.\nWe know that:\nCircumference of the circle = πd\nCircumference of the  semicircle =1\n2πd\n=1 22\n2 7×  × 14 cm = 22 cm\nCircumference of each of the semicircles is 22 cm\nTherefore, perimeter of the given figure = 4 × 22 cm  = 88 cm14 cm 14 cm\nFig 9.23\n2024-25\n\nMATHEMA TICS 156\nFig 9.24\nFig 9.25\nArrange the separate pieces as shown, in Fig 9.27,  which is roughly a parallelogram.\nThe more sectors we have, the nearer we reach an appropriate parallelogram.Fig 9.26(i) (ii)\nFig 9.27EXAMPLE  11Sudhanshu divides a circular disc of radius 7 cm in two equal parts.\nWhat is the perimeter of each semicircular shape disc? (Use π = 22\n7)\nSOLUTION To find the perimeter of the semicircular disc (Fig 9.24), we need to find\n(i)Circumference of semicircular shape (ii)Diameter\nGiven that radius ( r) = 7 cm. We know that the circumference of circle = 2 πr\nSo, the circumference of the semicircle =   122r× π  = πr\n=    22\n7× 7 cm = 22 cm\nSo, the diameter of the circle =     2 r = 2 × 7 cm = 14 cm\nThus, perimeter of each semicircular disc = 22 cm + 14 cm = 36 cm\n9.3.2  Area of Circle\nConsider the following:\n/circle6 A farmer dug a flower bed of radius 7 m at the centre of a field. He needs\nto purchase fertiliser . If 1 kg of fertiliser is required for 1 square metre\narea, how much  fertiliser should he purchase?\n/circle6 What will be the cost of polishing a circular table-top of radius 2 m at the\nrate of ` 10 per square metre?\nCan you tell what we need to find in such cases, Area or Perimeter? In such cases\nwe need to find the area of the circular region. Let us find the area of a circle,\nusing graph paper .\nDraw a circle of radius 4 cm on a graph paper (Fig 9.25). Find the area by counting\nthe number of squares enclosed.\nAs the edges are not straight, we get a rough estimate of the area of circle by this method.\nThere is another way of finding the area of a circle.\nDraw a circle and shade one half of the circle [Fig 9.26(i)]. Now fold the circle into\neighths  and cut along the folds [Fig 9.26(ii)].\n2024-25\n\nPERIMETER AND AREA 157\nAs done above if we divide the circle in 64 sectors, and arrange these sectors. It\ngives nearly a rectangle (Fig 9.28).\nFig 9.28\nWhat is the breadth of this rectangle? The breadth of this rectangle is the radius of the\ncircle, i.e., ‘ r’.\nAs the whole circle is divided into 64 sectors and on each side we have 32 sectors, the\nlength of the rectangle is the length of the 32 sectors, which is half of the circumference.\n(Fig 9.28)\n Area of the circle = Area of rectangle thus formed = l × b\n= (Half of circumference) × radius  = 122r × π  × r = πr2\nSo, the area of the circle = πr2\nDraw circles of dif ferent radii on a graph paper . Find the area by counting the\nnumber of squares. Also find the area by using the formula. Compare the two answers.\nEXAMPLE  12Find the area of a circle of radius 30 cm (use π = 3.14).\nSOLUTION Radius, r = 30 cm\nArea of the circle = πr2 = 3.14 × 302 = 2,826 cm2\nEXAMPLE  13Diameter of a circular garden is 9.8 m. Find its area.\nSOLUTION Diameter , d = 9.8 m. Therefore, radius r = 9.8 ÷ 2 = 4.9 m\nArea of the circle = πr2 = 22\n74 92×( . ) m2 = 22\n74 9 4 9× ×. . m2 = 75.46 m2\nEXAMPLE  14The adjoining figure shows two circles with the same centre. The\nradius of the larger circle is 10 cm and the radius of the smaller\ncircle is 4 cm.\nFind: (a)the area of the larger circle\n(b) the area of the smaller circle\n(c)the shaded area between the two circles. ( π = 3.14)TRY THESE\nCircumferenceRadius\n2024-25\n\nMATHEMA TICS 158\nSOLUTION\n(a)Radius of the larger circle =10 cm\nSo, area of the larger circle =πr2\n=3.14 × 10 × 10 = 314 cm2\n(b) Radius of the smaller circle =4 cm\nArea of the smaller circle =πr2\n=3.14 × 4 × 4 = 50.24 cm2\n(c)Area of the shaded region =(314 – 50.24) cm2 = 263.76 cm2\nEXERCISE  9.2\n1.Find the circumference of the circles with the following radius: (T ake π = 22\n7)\n(a)14 cm (b)28 mm (c)21 cm\n2.Find the area of the following circles, given that:\n(a)radius = 14 mm (T ake π = 22\n7) (b)diameter = 49 m\n(c)radius = 5 cm\n3.If the circumference of a circular sheet is 154 m, find its radius. Also find the area of\nthe sheet. (T ake π = 22\n7)\n4.A gardener wants to fence a circular garden of diameter 21m. Find the length of the\nrope he needs to purchase, if he makes 2 rounds of fence. Also find the cost of the\nrope, if it costs ` 4 per meter . (Take π = 22\n7)\n5.From a circular sheet of radius 4 cm, a circle of radius 3 cm is removed. Find the area\nof the remaining sheet. (T ake π = 3.14)\n6.Saima wants to put a lace on the edge of a circular table cover of diameter 1.5 m.\nFind the length of the lace required and also find its cost if one meter of the lace costs\n` 15.

(Fig 9.19)\n(a) (b) (c)\nFig 9.19\nYou cannot measure the curves with the help of a ruler , as these figures are not “straight”.\nWhat can you do?\nHere is a way to find the length of lace required for shape in\nFig 9.19(a). Mark a point on the edge of the card and place the\ncard on the table. Mark the position of the point on the table also\n(Fig 9. 20).\nNow roll the circular card on the table along a straight line till\nthe marked point again touches the table. Measure the distance\nalong the line. This is the length of the lace required (Fig 9.21). It is also the distance along\nthe edge of the card from the marked point back to the marked point.\nYou can also find the distance by putting a string on the edge of the circular object and\ntaking all round it.\nThe distance around a circular region is known as its circumference.\nTake a bottle cap, a bangle or any other circular object and find the circumference.\nNow, can you find the distance covered by the athlete on the track by this method?\nStill, it will be very difficult to find the distance around the track or any other circular\nobject by measuring through string. Moreover , the measurement will not be accurate.\nSo, we need some formula for this, as we have for rectilinear figures or shapes.\nLet us see if there is any relationship between the diameter and the circumference of\nthe circles.\nConsider the following table: Draw six circles of different radii and find their circumference\nby using string. Also find the ratio of the circumference to the diameter .\nCircle Radius Diameter Circumference Ratio of Circumference\nto Diameter\n1. 3.5 cm 7.0 cm 22.0 cm22\n7= 3.14Fig 9.20\nFig 9.21\nDO THIS\n2024-25\n\nMATHEMA TICS 154\n2. 7.0 cm 14.0 cm 44.0 cm44\n14=3.14\n3. 10.5 cm 21.0 cm 66.0 cm66\n21=3.14\n4. 21.0 cm 42.0 cm 132.0 cm132\n42=3.14\n5. 5.0 cm 10.0 cm 32.0 cm32\n10=3.2\n6. 15.0 cm 30.0 cm 94.0 cm94\n30=3.13\nWhat do you infer from the above table? Is this ratio approximately the same? Yes.\nCan you say that the circumference of a circle is always more than three times its\ndiameter? Yes.\nThis ratio is a constant and is denoted by π (pi). Its approximate value is 22\n7 or 3.14.\nSo, we can say that  C\nd= π, where ‘C’ represents circumference of the circle and ‘ d’\nits diameter .\nor C =πd\nWe know that diameter ( d) of a circle is twice the radius ( r) i.e., d = 2r\nSo, C =πd = π × 2r or   C = 2\nπr.\nIn Fig 9.22,\n (a) Which square has the larger perimeter?\n (b) Which is lar ger, perimeter of smaller square or the\ncircumference of the circle?\nTake one each of quarter plate and half plate. Roll once each of\nthese on a table-top. Which plate covers more distance in one\ncomplete revolution? Which plate will take less number of revolutions\nto cover the length of the table-top?DO THISTRY THESE\nFig 9.22\n2024-25\n\nPERIMETER AND AREA 155\nEXAMPLE  7What is the circumference of a circle of diameter 10  cm (Take π = 3.14)?\nSOLUTION Diameter of the circle ( d) = 10 cm\nCircumference of circle = πd\n=3.14 × 10 cm = 31.4 cm\nSo, the circumference of the circle of diameter 10 cm is 31.4 cm.\nEXAMPLE  8  What is the circumference of a circular disc of radius 14 cm?\nUseπ =\n\n22\n7\nSOLUTION Radius of circular disc (r) = 14 cm\nCircumference of disc = 2πr\n=222\n714 × ×  cm = 88 cm\nSo, the circumference of the circular disc is 88 cm.\nEXAMPLE  9The radius of a circular pipe is 10 cm. What length of a tape is required\nto wrap once around the pipe ( π = 3.14)?\nSOLUTION Radius of the pipe ( r) = 10 cm\nLength of tape required is equal to the circumference of the pipe.\nCircumference of the pipe = 2πr\n=2 × 3.14 × 10 cm\n=62.8 cm\nTherefore, length of the tape needed to wrap once around the pipe is 62.8 cm.\nEXAMPLE  10Find the perimeter of the given shape (Fig 9.23) (T ake π = 22\n7).\nSOLUTION In this shape we need to find the circumference of semicircles on each side\nof the square. Do you need to find the perimeter of the square also? No.\nThe outer boundary , of this figure is made up of semicircles. Diameter of\neach semicircle is 14 cm.\nWe know that:\nCircumference of the circle = πd\nCircumference of the  semicircle =1\n2πd\n=1 22\n2 7×  × 14 cm = 22 cm\nCircumference of each of the semicircles is 22 cm\nTherefore, perimeter of the given figure = 4 × 22 cm  = 88 cm14 cm 14 cm\nFig 9.23\n2024-25\n\nMATHEMA TICS 156\nFig 9.24\nFig 9.25\nArrange the separate pieces as shown, in Fig 9.27,  which is roughly a parallelogram.\nThe more sectors we have, the nearer we reach an appropriate parallelogram.Fig 9.26(i) (ii)\nFig 9.27EXAMPLE  11Sudhanshu divides a circular disc of radius 7 cm in two equal parts.\nWhat is the perimeter of each semicircular shape disc? (Use π = 22\n7)\nSOLUTION To find the perimeter of the semicircular disc (Fig 9.24), we need to find\n(i)Circumference of semicircular shape (ii)Diameter\nGiven that radius ( r) = 7 cm. We know that the circumference of circle = 2 πr\nSo, the circumference of the semicircle =   122r× π  = πr\n=    22\n7× 7 cm = 22 cm\nSo, the diameter of the circle =     2 r = 2 × 7 cm = 14 cm\nThus, perimeter of each semicircular disc = 22 cm + 14 cm = 36 cm\n9.3.2  Area of Circle\nConsider the following:\n/circle6 A farmer dug a flower bed of radius 7 m at the centre of a field. He needs\nto purchase fertiliser . If 1 kg of fertiliser is required for 1 square metre\narea, how much  fertiliser should he purchase?\n/circle6 What will be the cost of polishing a circular table-top of radius 2 m at the\nrate of ` 10 per square metre?\nCan you tell what we need to find in such cases, Area or Perimeter? In such cases\nwe need to find the area of the circular region. Let us find the area of a circle,\nusing graph paper .\nDraw a circle of radius 4 cm on a graph paper (Fig 9.25). Find the area by counting\nthe number of squares enclosed.\nAs the edges are not straight, we get a rough estimate of the area of circle by this method.\nThere is another way of finding the area of a circle.\nDraw a circle and shade one half of the circle [Fig 9.26(i)]. Now fold the circle into\neighths  and cut along the folds [Fig 9.26(ii)].\n2024-25\n\nPERIMETER AND AREA 157\nAs done above if we divide the circle in 64 sectors, and arrange these sectors. It\ngives nearly a rectangle (Fig 9.28).\nFig 9.28\nWhat is the breadth of this rectangle? The breadth of this rectangle is the radius of the\ncircle, i.e., ‘ r’.\nAs the whole circle is divided into 64 sectors and on each side we have 32 sectors, the\nlength of the rectangle is the length of the 32 sectors, which is half of the circumference.\n(Fig 9.28)\n Area of the circle = Area of rectangle thus formed = l × b\n= (Half of circumference) × radius  = 122r × π  × r = πr2\nSo, the area of the circle = πr2\nDraw circles of dif ferent radii on a graph paper . Find the area by counting the\nnumber of squares. Also find the area by using the formula. Compare the two answers.\nEXAMPLE  12Find the area of a circle of radius 30 cm (use π = 3.14).\nSOLUTION Radius, r = 30 cm\nArea of the circle = πr2 = 3.14 × 302 = 2,826 cm2\nEXAMPLE  13Diameter of a circular garden is 9.8 m. Find its area.\nSOLUTION Diameter , d = 9.8 m. Therefore, radius r = 9.8 ÷ 2 = 4.9 m\nArea of the circle = πr2 = 22\n74 92×( . ) m2 = 22\n74 9 4 9× ×. . m2 = 75.46 m2\nEXAMPLE  14The adjoining figure shows two circles with the same centre.
