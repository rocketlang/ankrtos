Geometry appears to have originated from\nthe need for measuring land. This branch of mathematics was studied in various\nforms in every ancient civilisation, be it in Egypt, Babylonia, China, India, Greece,\nthe Incas, etc. The people of these civilisations faced several practical problems\nwhich required the development of geometry in various ways.\nFor example, whenever the river Nile\noverflowed, it wiped out the boundaries between\nthe adjoining fields of dif ferent land owners. After\nsuch flooding, these boundaries had to be\nredrawn. For this purpose, the Egyptians\ndeveloped a number of geometric techniques and\nrules for calculating simple areas and also for\ndoing simple constructions. The knowledge of\ngeometry was also used by them for computing\nvolumes of granaries, and for constructing canals\nand pyramids. They also knew the correct formula\nto find the volume of a truncated pyramid (see\nFig. 5.1).Y ou know that a pyramid is a solid figure,\nthe base of which is a triangle, or square, or some\nother polygon, and its side faces are triangles\nconverging to a point at the top.Fig. 5.1 :  A Truncated Pyramid\nReprint 2025-26\n\nINTRODUCTION  TO EUCLID ’S GEOMETRY 61\nIn the Indian subcontinent, the excavations at Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro, etc.\nshow that the Indus Valley Civilisation (about 3000 BCE) made extensive use of\ngeometry . It was a highly or ganised society . The cities were highly developed and\nvery well planned. For example, the roads were parallel to each other and there was\nan underground drainage system. The houses had many rooms of different types. This\nshows that the town dwellers were skilled in mensuration and practical arithmetic.\nThe bricks used for constructions were kiln fired and the ratio length : breadth : thickness,\nof the bricks was found to be 4 : 2 : 1.\nIn ancient India, the Sulbasutras  (800 BCE to 500 BCE) were the manuals of\ngeometrical constructions. The geometry of the Vedic period originated with the\nconstruction of altars (or vedis ) and fireplaces for performing Vedic rites. The location\nof the sacred fires had to be in accordance to the clearly laid down instructions about\ntheir shapes and areas, if they were to be effective instruments. Square and circular\naltars were used for household rituals, while altars whose shapes were combinations\nof rectangles, triangles and trapeziums were required for public worship. The sriyantra\n(given in the Atharvaveda ) consists of nine interwoven isosceles triangles. These\ntriangles are arranged in such a way that they produce 43 subsidiary triangles. Though\naccurate geometric methods were used for the constructions of altars, the principles\nbehind them were not discussed.\nThese examples show that geometry was being developed and applied everywhere\nin the world. But this was happening in an unsystematic manner . What is interesting\nabout these developments of geometry in the ancient world is that they were passed\non from one generation to the next, either orally or through palm leaf messages, or by\nother ways. Also, we find that in some civilisations like Babylonia, geometry remained\na very practical oriented discipline, as was the case in India and Rome. The geometry\ndeveloped by Egyptians mainly consisted of the statements of results. There were no\ngeneral rules of the procedure. In fact, Babylonians and Egyptians used geometry\nmostly for practical purposes and did very little to develop it as a systematic science.\nBut in civilisations like Greece, the emphasis was on the reasoning  behind why certain\nconstructions work. The Greeks were interested in establishing the truth of the\nstatements they discovered using deductive reasoning (see Appendix 1).\nA Greek mathematician, Thales is credited with giving the\nfirst known proof. This proof was of the statement that a circle\nis bisected (i.e., cut into two equal parts) by its diameter . One of\nThales’ most famous pupils was Pythagoras (572 BCE), whom\nyou have heard about. Pythagoras and his group discovered many\ngeometric properties and developed the theory of geometry to a\ngreat extent. This process continued till 300 BCE. At that time\nEuclid, a teacher of mathematics at Alexandria in Egypt, collected\nall the known work and arranged it in his famous treatise,Thales\n(640 BCE – 546 BCE)\nFig. 5.2\nReprint 2025-26\n\n62 MATHEMA TICS\ncalled ‘Elements’. He divided the ‘Elements’ into thirteen\nchapters, each called a book. These books influenced\nthe whole world’ s understanding of geometry for\ngenerations to come.\nIn this chapter , we shall discuss Euclid’ s approach\nto geometry and shall try to link it with the present day\ngeometry .\n5.2 Euclid’ s Definitions, Axioms and Postulates\nThe Greek mathematicians of Euclid’ s time thought of geometry as an abstract model\nof the world in which they lived. The notions of point, line, plane (or surface) and so on\nwere derived from what was seen around them. From studies of the space and solids\nin the space around them, an abstract geometrical notion of a solid object was developed.\nA solid has shape, size, position, and can be moved from one place to another . Its\nboundaries are called surfaces. They separate one part of the space from another ,\nand are said to have no thickness. The boundaries of the surfaces are curves  or\nstraight lines.  These lines end in points .\nConsider the three steps from solids to points (solids-surfaces-lines-points). In\neach step we lose one extension, also called a dimension . So, a solid has three\ndimensions, a surface has two, a line has one and a point has none. Euclid summarised\nthese statements as definitions. He began his exposition by listing 23 definitions in\nBook 1 of the ‘Elements’. A few of them are given below :\n1.A point  is that which has no part.\n2.A line is breadthless length.\n3.The ends of a line are points.\n4.A straight line is a line which lies evenly with the points on itself.\n5.A surface is that which has length and breadth only .\n6.The edges of a surface are lines.\n7.A plane surface  is a surface which lies evenly with the straight lines on itself.\nIf you carefully study these definitions, you find that some of the terms like part,\nbreadth, length, evenly , etc. need to be further explained clearly . For example, consider\nhis definition of a point. In this definition, ‘a part’ needs to be defined. Suppose if you\ndefine ‘a part’ to be that which occupies ‘area’, again ‘an area’ needs to be defined.\nSo, to define one thing, you need to define many other things, and you may get a long\nchain of definitions without an end. For such reasons, mathematicians agree to leaveEuclid (325 BCE – 265 BCE)\nFig. 5.3\nReprint 2025-26\n\nINTRODUCTION  TO EUCLID ’S GEOMETRY 63\nsome geometric terms undefined . However , we do have a intuitive feeling for the\ngeometric concept of a point than what the ‘definition’ above gives us. So, we represent\na point as a dot, even though a dot has some dimension.\nA similar problem arises in Definition 2 above, since it refers to breadth and length,\nneither of which has been defined. Because of this, a few terms are kept undefined\nwhile developing any course of study . So, in geometry , we take a point, a line and a\nplane (in Euclid‘s wor ds a plane surface ) as undefined terms . The only thing is\nthat we can represent them intuitively , or explain them with the help of ‘physical\nmodels’.\nStarting with his definitions, Euclid assumed certain properties, which were not to\nbe proved. These assumptions are actually ‘obvious universal truths’. He divided them\ninto two types: axioms and postulates. He used the term ‘ postulate ’ for the assumptions\nthat were specific to geometry . Common notions (often called axioms ), on the other\nhand, were assumptions used throughout mathematics and not specifically linked to\ngeometry . For details about axioms and postulates, refer to Appendix 1. Some of\nEuclid’ s axioms , not in his order , are given below :\n(1)Things which are equal to the same thing are equal to one another .\n(2)If equals are added to equals, the wholes are equal.\n(3)If equals are subtracted from equals, the remainders are equal.\n(4)Things which coincide with one another are equal to one another .\n(5)The whole is greater than the part.\n(6)Things which are double of the same things are equal to one another .\n(7)Things which are halves of the same things are equal to one another .\nThese ‘common notions’ refer to magnitudes of some kind. The first common\nnotion could be applied to plane figures. For example, if an area of a triangle equals the\narea of a rectangle and the area of the rectangle equals that of a square, then the area\nof the triangle also equals the area of the square.\nMagnitudes of the same kind can be compared and added, but magnitudes of\ndifferent kinds cannot be compared. For example, a line cannot be compared to a\nrectangle, nor can an angle be compared to a pentagon.\nThe 4th axiom given above seems to say that if two things are identical (that is,\nthey are the same), then they are equal. In other words, everything equals itself. It is\nthe justification of the principle of superposition. Axiom (5) gives us the definition of\n‘greater than’. For example, if a quantity B is a part of another quantity A, then A can\nbe written as the sum of B and some third quantity C. Symbolically , A > B means that\nthere is some C such that A = B + C.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n64 MATHEMA TICS\nNow let us discuss Euclid’ s five postulates.  They are :\nPostulate 1 :  A straight line may be drawn fr om any one point to any other point.\nNote that this postulate tells us that at least one straight line passes through two\ndistinct points, but it does not say that there cannot be more than one such line. However ,\nin his work, Euclid has frequently assumed, without mentioning, that there is a unique\nline joining two distinct points. We state this result in the form of an axiom as follows:\nAxiom 5.1 :  Given two distinct points, ther e is a unique line that passes thr ough\nthem .\nHow many lines passing through P also pass through Q (see Fig. 5.4)? Only one,\nthat is, the line PQ. How many lines passing through Q also pass through P? Only one,\nthat is, the line PQ. Thus, the statement above is self-evident, and so is taken as an\naxiom.\nFig. 5.4\nPostulate 2 :  A terminated line can be pr oduced indefinitely .\nNote that what we call a line segment now-a-days is what Euclid called a terminated\nline. So, according to the present day terms, the second postulate says that a line\nsegment can be extended on either side to form a line (see Fig. 5.5).\nFig. 5.5\nPostulate 3 : A circle can be drawn with any centr e and any radius .\nPostulate 4 : All right angles ar e equal to one another .\nPostulate 5 : If a straight line falling on two straight lines makes the interior\nangles on the same side of it taken together less than two right angles, then the\ntwo straight lines, if pr oduced indefinitely , meet on that side on which the sum of\nangles is less than two right angles.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nINTRODUCTION  TO EUCLID ’S GEOMETRY 65\nFor example, the line PQ in Fig. 5.6 falls on lines\nAB and CD such that the sum of the interior angles 1\nand 2 is less than 180° on the left side of PQ.\nTherefore, the lines AB and CD will eventually\nintersect on the left side of PQ.\nA brief look at the five postulates brings to your notice that Postulate 5 is far more\ncomplex than any other postulate. On the other hand, Postulates 1 through 4 are so\nsimple and obvious that these are taken as ‘self-evident truths’. However , it is not\npossible to prove them. So, these statements are accepted without any proof\n(see Appendix 1). Because of its complexity , the fifth postulate will be given more\nattention in the next section.\nNow-a-days, ‘postulates’ and ‘axioms’ are terms that are used interchangeably\nand in the same sense. ‘Postulate’ is actually a verb. When we say “let us postulate”,\nwe mean, “let us make some statement based on the observed phenomenon in the\nUniverse”. Its truth/validity is checked afterwards. If it is true, then it is accepted as a\n‘Postulate’.\nA system of axioms is called consistent (see Appendix 1), if it is impossible to\ndeduce from these axioms a statement that contradicts any axiom or previously proved\nstatement. So, when any system of axioms is given, it needs to be ensured that the\nsystem is consistent.\nAfter Euclid stated his postulates and axioms, he used them to prove other results.\nThen using these results, he proved some more results by applying deductive reasoning.\nThe statements that were proved are called propositions or theorems . Euclid\ndeduced 465 propositions in a logical chain using his axioms, postulates, definitions and\ntheorems proved earlier in the chain. In the next few chapters on geometry , you will\nbe using these axioms to prove some theorems.\nNow, let us see in the following examples how Euclid used his axioms and postulates\nfor proving some of the results:\nExample 1 :  If A, B and C are three points on a line, and B lies between A and C\n(see Fig. 5.7), then prove that AB + BC = AC.\nFig. 5.7Fig. 5.6\nReprint 2025-26\n\n66 MATHEMA TICS\nSolution :  In the figure given above, AC coincides with AB + BC.\nAlso, Euclid’ s Axiom (4) says that things which coincide with one another are equal to\none another . So, it can be deduced that\nAB + BC = AC\nNote that in this solution, it has been assumed that there is a unique line passing\nthrough two points.\nExample 2 :  Prove that an equilateral triangle can be constructed on any given line\nsegment.\nSolution :  In the statement above, a line segment of any length is given, say AB\n[see Fig. 5.8(i)].\nFig. 5.8\nHere, you need to do some construction. Using Euclid’ s Postulate 3, you can draw a\ncircle with point A as the centre and AB as the radius [see Fig. 5.8(ii)]. Similarly , draw\nanother circle with point B as the centre and BA as the radius. The two circles meet at\na point, say C. Now , draw the line segments AC and BC to form ∆ ABC\n[see Fig. 5.8 (iii)].\nSo, you have to prove that this triangle is equilateral, i.e., AB = AC = BC.\nNow, AB = AC, since they are the radii of the same circle (1)\nSimilarly ,AB = BC (Radii of the same circle) (2)\nFrom these two facts, and Euclid’ s axiom that things which are equal to the same thing\nare equal to one another , you can conclude that AB = BC = AC.\nSo, ∆ ABC is an equilateral triangle.\nNote that here Euclid has assumed, without mentioning anywhere, that the two circles\ndrawn with centres A and B will meet each other at a point.\nNow we prove a theorem, which is frequently used in different results:\nReprint 2025-26\n\nINTRODUCTION  TO EUCLID ’S GEOMETRY 67\nTheor em 5.1 :  Two distinct lines cannot have mor e than one point in common.\nProof :  Here we are given two lines l and m. We need to prove that they have only one\npoint in common.\nFor the time being, let us suppose that the two lines intersect in two distinct points,\nsay P and Q. So, you have two lines passing through two distinct points P and Q. But\nthis assumption clashes with the axiom that only one line can pass through two distinct\npoints. So, the assumption that we started with, that two lines can pass through two\ndistinct points is wrong.\nFrom this, what can we conclude? We are forced to conclude that two distinct\nlines cannot have more than one point in common.\nEXERCISE 5.1\n1.Which of the following statements are true and which are false? Give reasons for your\nanswers.\n(i)Only one line can pass through a single point.\n(ii)There are an infinite number of lines which pass through two distinct points.\n(iii)A terminated line can be produced indefinitely on both the sides.\n(iv)If two circles are equal, then their radii are equal.\n(v)In Fig. 5.9, if AB = PQ and PQ = XY , then AB = XY .\nFig. 5.9\n2.Give a definition for each of the following terms. Are there other terms that need to be\ndefined first? What are they , and how might you define them?\n(i)parallel lines (ii)perpendicular lines (iii)line segment\n(iv)radius of a circle (v)square\n3.Consider two ‘postulates’ given below:\n(i)Given any two distinct points A and B, there exists a third point C which is in\nbetween A and B.\n(ii)There exist at least three points that are not on the same line.\nDo these postulates contain any undefined terms? Are these postulates consistent?\nDo they follow from Euclid’ s postulates? Explain.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n68 MATHEMA TICS\n4.If a point C lies between two points A and B such that AC = BC, then prove that\nAC = 1\n2AB. Explain by drawing the figure.\n5.In Question 4, point C is called a mid-point of line segment AB. Prove that every line\nsegment has one and only one mid-point.\n6.In Fig. 5.10, if AC = BD, then prove that AB = CD.\nFig. 5.10\n7.Why is Axiom 5, in the list of Euclid’ s axioms, considered a ‘universal truth’? (Note that\nthe question is not about the fifth postulate.)\n5.3 Summary\nIn this chapter , you have studied the following points:\n1.Though Euclid defined a point, a line, and a plane, the definitions are not accepted by\nmathematicians. Therefore, these terms are now taken as undefined.\n2.Axioms or postulates are the assumptions which are obvious universal truths. They are not\nproved.\n3.Theorems are statements which are proved, using definitions, axioms, previously proved\nstatements and deductive reasoning.\n4.Some of Euclid’ s axioms were :\n(1)Things which are equal to the same thing are equal to one another .\n(2)If equals are added to equals, the wholes are equal.\n(3)If equals are subtracted from equals, the remainders are equal.\n(4)Things which coincide with one another are equal to one another .\n(5)The whole is greater than the part.\n(6)Things which are double of the same things are equal to one another .\n(7)Things which are halves of the same things are equal to one another .\n5.Euclid’ s postulates were :\nPostulate 1 :  A straight line may be drawn from any one point to any other point.\nPostulate 2 :  A terminated line can be produced indefinitely .\nPostulate 3 :  A circle can be drawn with any centre and any radius.\nPostulate  4 :  All right angles are equal to one another .\nReprint 2025-26\n\n",
