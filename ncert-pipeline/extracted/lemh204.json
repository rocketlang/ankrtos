Hamil ton\n(1805-1865)\nReprint 2025-26\n\nVECT OR ALGEBRA 339\nNow  observe that if we restrict the line l to the line segment AB, then a magnitude\nis prescribed on the line l with one of the two directions, so that we obtain a directed\nline segment (Fig 10.1(iii)). Thus, a directed line segment has magnitude as well as\ndirection.\nDefinition 1 A quantity that has magnitude as well as direction is called a vector .\nNotice that a directed line segment is a vector (Fig 10.1(iii)), denoted as  or\nsimply as , and read as ‘vector ’ or ‘vector ’.\nThe point A from where the vector  starts is called its initial point , and the\npoint B where it ends is called its terminal point . The distance between initial and\nterminal po ints of a vector is called the magnitude  (or length) of the vector , denoted as\n||, or ||, or a. The arrow indicates the direction of the vector .\n/handptrtsld1Note    Since the length is never negative, the notation || < 0 has no meaning.\nPosition Vector\nFrom Class XI, recall the three dimensional right handed rectangular coordinate system\n(Fig 10.2(i)). Consider a point P  in space, having coordinates ( x, y, z) with respect to\nthe origin O(0, 0, 0). Then, the vector  having O and P as its initial and terminal\npoints, r espectively , is called the position vector  of the point P  with respect\nto O. Using distance formula (from Class XI), the magnitude of  (or ) is given by\n||=2 2 2x y z+ +\nIn practice, the position vectors of points A, B, C, etc., with respect to the origin O\nare denoted by , , , etc., respectively (Fig 10.2 (ii)).Fig 10.1\nReprint 2025-26\n\n MA THEMA TICS 340\nAOP\n/c9790°\nXYZ\nXAO\nBP( )x,y,zC\n/c97/c98/c103P( )x,y,z\nr\nxyzDirection Cosines\nConsider the position vector  of a point P( x, y, z) as in Fig 10.3. The angles α,\nβ, γ made by the vector  with the positive directions of x, y and z-axes respectively ,\nare called its direction angles . The cosine values of these angles, i.e., co sα, cosβ and\ncosγ are called direction cosines  of the vector , and usually denoted by l, m and n,\nrespectively .\nFig 10.3\nFrom  Fig 10.3, one may note that the triangle OAP is right angled, and in it, we\nhave . Similarly , from the right angled triangles OBP  and\nOCP, we may write cos  and cosy z\nr rβ = γ = . Thus, the coordinates of the point P  may\nalso be expressed as ( lr, mr,nr).  The number s lr, mr and nr, proportional to the direction\ncosines are called as direction ratios  of vector  , and denoted as a, b and c, respectively .Fig 10.2\nReprint 2025-26\n\nVECT OR ALGEBRA 341\n/handptrtsld1Note    One may note that l2 + m2 + n2 = 1 but a2 + b2 + c2 ≠ 1, in general.\n10.3  Types of Vectors\nZero Vector  A vector whose initial and terminal points coincide, is called a zero vector\n(or null vector), and denoted as . Zero vector can not be assigned a definite direction\nas it has zero magnitude. Or , alternatively otherwise, it may be regarded as having any\ndirection. The vectors  represent the zero vector ,\nUnit Vector  A vector whose magnitude is unity (i.e., 1 unit) is called a unit vector . The\nunit vector in the direction of a given vector  is denoted by ˆa.\nCoinitial Vectors  Two or more vectors having the same initial point are called coinitial\nvectors.\nCollinear  Vectors T wo or more vectors are said to be collinear if they are parallel to\nthe same line, irrespective of their magnitudes and directions.\nEqual Vectors  Two vectors  are said to be equal, if they have the same\nmagnitude and direction regardless of the positions of their initial points, and written\nas .\nNegative of a V ector  A vector whose magnitude is the same as that of a given vector\n(say, ), but direction is opposite to that of it, is called negative of the given vector .\nFor example, vector  is negative of the vector , and written as  = – .\nRemark  The vectors defined above are such that any of them may be subject to its\nparallel displacement without changing its magnitude and direction. Such vectors are\ncalled free vectors . Throughout this chapter , we will be dealing with free vectors only .\nExample 1  Represent graphically a displacement\nof 40 km, 30° west of south.\nSolution The vector  represents the required\ndisplacement (Fig 10.4).\nExample 2  Classify the following measures as\nscalars and vectors.\n(i)5 seconds\n(ii)1000 cm3\nFig 10.4\nReprint 2025-26\n\n MA THEMA TICS 342\nFig 10.5(iii)10 Newton (iv) 30 km/hr (v)10 g/cm3\n(vi) 20 m/s towards north\nSolution\n(i)Time-scalar (ii)Volume-scalar (iii)Force-vector\n(iv) Speed-scalar (v)Density-scalar (vi) Velocity-vector\nExample 3 In Fig 10.5, which of the vectors are:\n(i)Collinear (ii)Equal (iii)Coinitial\nSolution\n(i)Collinear vectors : .\n(ii)Equal vectors : \n(iii)Coinitial vectors : \nEXERCISE 10.1\n1.Represent graphically a displacement of 40 km, 30° east of north.\n2.Classify the following measures as scalars and vectors.\n(i)10 kg (ii)2 meters north-west (iii)40°\n(iv) 40 watt (v)10–19 coulomb (vi) 20 m/s2\n3.Classify the following as scalar and vector quantities.\n(i)time period (ii)distance (iii)force\n(iv) velocity (v)work done\n4.In Fig 10.6 (a square),  identify the following vectors.\n(i)Coinitial (ii)Equal\n(iii)Collinear but not equal\n5.Answer the following as true or false.\n(i)  and –  are collinear .\n(ii)Two collinear vectors are always equal in\nmagnitude.\n(iii)Two vectors having same magnitude are collinear .\n(iv) Two collinear vectors having the same magnitude are equal.Fig 10.6\nReprint 2025-26\n\nVECT OR ALGEBRA 343\n10.4  Addition of Vectors\nA vector  simply means the displacement from a point\nA to the point B. Now consider a situation that a girl\nmoves from A to B and then from B to C\n(Fig 10.7). The net displacement made by the girl from\npoint A to the point C, is given by the vector  and\nexpressed as\n = \nThis is known as the triangle law of vector addition.\nIn general, if we have two vectors  and  (Fig 10.8 (i)), then to add them, they are\npositioned so that the initial point of one coincides with the terminal point of the other\n(Fig 10.8(ii)).Fig 10.7\nab\nab\n(i) (iii)AC\nab\n(ii)ab+\nAC\nB B\na\nb––b\nC’\nFig 10.8\nFor example, in Fig 10.8 (ii), we have shifted vector  without changing its magnitude\nand direction, so that it’ s initial point coincides with the terminal point of . Then, the\nvector  + , represented by the third side AC of the triangle ABC, gives us the sum (or\nresultant) of the vectors  and  i.e., in triangle ABC (Fig 10.8 (ii)), we have\n =\nNow again, since , from the above equation, we have\nThis means that when the sides of a triangle are taken in order , it leads to zero\nresultant as the initia l and terminal points get coincided (Fig 10.8(iii)).\nReprint 2025-26\n\n MA THEMA TICS 344\nNow , construct a vector  so that its magnitude is same as the vector , but the\ndirection opposite to that of it (Fig 10.8 (iii)), i.e.,\n =\nThen, on applying triangle law from the Fig 10.8 (iii), we have\n =  \nThe vector  is said to represent the differ ence of .\nNow , consider a boat in a river going from one bank of the river to the other in a\ndirection perpendicular to the flow of the river . Then, it is acted upon by two velocity\nvectors–one is the velocity imparted to the boat by its engine and other one is the\nvelocity of the flow of river water . Under the simultaneous influence of these two\nvelocities, the boat in actual starts travelling with a dif ferent velocity . To have a precise\nidea about the effective speed and direction\n(i.e., the resultant velocity) of the boat, we have\nthe following law of vector addition.\nIf we have  two vectors   represented\nby the two adjacent sides of a parallelogram\nin magnitude and direction (Fig 10.9), then their\nsum  is represented in magnitude and\ndirection by the diagonal of the parallelogram\nthrough their common point. This is known as\nthe parallelogram law of vector addition.\n/handptrtsld1Note     From Fig 10.9, using the triangle law , one may note that\n =\nor  =                                   (since  )\nwhich is parallelogram law . Thus, we may say that the two laws of vector\naddition are equivalent to each other .\nProperties of vector addition\nProperty 1  For any two vectors ,\n = (Commutative property)Fig 10.9\nReprint 2025-26\n\nVECT OR ALGEBRA 345\nProof Consider the parallelogram ABCD\n(Fig 10.10). Let  then using\nthe triangle law , from triangle ABC, we have\nNow , since the opposite sides of a\nparallelogram are equal and parallel, from\nFig10.10, we have,   and\n. Again using triangle law , from\ntriangle ADC, we have\nHence  =\nProperty 2  For any three vectors , anda b c   \n = (Associative property)\nProof Let the vectors  be represented by , respectively , as\nshown in Fig 10.1 1(i) and (ii).\nFig 10.1 1\nThen  =\nand  =\nSo  =Fig 10.10\nReprint 2025-26\n\n MA THEMA TICS 346\na a1212a\n–2aa2and  =\nHence  =\nRemark  The associative property of vector addition enables us to write the sum of\nthree vectors  without using brackets.\nNote that for any vector a , we have\n =\nHere, the zero vector  is called the additive identity  for the vector addition.\n10.5  Multiplication of a Vector  by a Scalar\nLet  be a given vector and λ a scalar . Then the product of the vector  by the scalar\nλ, denoted as λ, is called the multiplication of vector  by the scalar λ. Note that, λ\nis also a vector , collinear to the vector . The vector λ  has the direction same (or\nopposite) to that of vector  according as the value of λ is positive (or negative). Also,\nthe magnitude of vector λ is |λ| times the magnitude of the vector , i.e.,\n|λ| =|λ|||\nA geometric visualisation of multiplication of a vector by a scalar is given\nin Fig 10.12.\nFig 10.12\nWhen λ  = –1, then λ= – , which is a vector having magnitude equal to the\nmagnitude of  and direction opposite to that of the direction of . The vector –  is\ncalled the negative (or additive inverse ) of vector  and we always have\n + (– ) = (– ) +  = \nAlso, if 1=| |aλ , provided  ≠ 0 i.e.  is not a null vector , then\n|λ| =|λ||| = \nReprint 2025-26\n\nVECT OR ALGEBRA 347\nSo, λ  represents the unit vector in the dir ection of  . We write it as\nˆa =1\n| |/arrowrightnosp/arrowrightnospaa\n/handptrtsld1Note   For any scalar k, 0=0./arrowrightnosp /arrowrightnosp\nk\n10.5.1   Components of a vector\nLet us take the points A(1, 0, 0), B(0, 1, 0) and C(0, 0, 1) on the x-axis, y-axis and\nz-axis, respectively . Then, clearly\n||= 1, | |=1 and ||= 1\nThe vectors , each having magnitude 1,\nare called unit vectors along the axes OX, OY and OZ,\nrespectively , and denoted by ˆ ˆ ˆ,   and  i j k , respectively\n(Fig 10.13).\nNow , consider the position vector  of a point P(x, y, z)\nas in Fig 10.14. Let P1 be the foot of the perpendicular from P  on the plane XOY .\nWe, thus, see that P1 P is parallel to z-axis. As ˆ ˆ ˆ,  and i j k  are the unit vectors along the\nx, y and z-axes, respectively , and by the definition of the coordinates of P , we have\n. Similarly ,  and .Fig 10.13\nFig 10.14\nReprint 2025-26\n\n MA THEMA TICS 348\nTherefore, it follows that  =\nand  =\nHence, the position vector of P with reference to O is given by\n =\nThis form of any vector is called its component form. Here, x , y and z are called\nas the scalar components of , and ˆ ˆ ˆ,   andxi yj zk  are called the vector components\nof  along the respective axes. Sometimes x, y and z  are also termed as rectangular\ncomponents .\nThe length of any vector  =ˆ ˆ ˆ r xi yj zk= + + , is readily determined by applying the\nPythagoras theorem twice. We note that in the right angle triangle OQP1 (Fig 10.14)\n = ,\nand in the right angle triangle OP1P, we have\n =\nHence, the length of any vector   =ˆ ˆ ˆ + r xi yj zk= +  is given by\n| | =\nIf  are any two vectors given in the component form 1 2 3ˆ ˆ ˆ + a i a j a k+  and\n1 2 3ˆ ˆ ˆb i b j b k+ + , respectively , then\n(i)the sum (or resultant) of the vectors  is given by\n = 1 1 2 2 3 3ˆ ˆ ˆ ( ) ( ) ( )a b i a b j a b k+ + + + +\n(ii) the difference of the vector  is given by\n = 1 1 2 2 3 3ˆ ˆ ˆ ( ) ( ) ( )a b i a b j a b k− + − + −\n(iii) the vectors  are equal if and only if\na1 =b1, a2 = b2   and   a3 = b3\n(iv) the multiplication of vector  by any scalar λ is given by\nλ =1 2 3ˆ ˆ ˆ ( ) ( ) ( )a i a j a kλ + λ + λ\nReprint 2025-26\n\nVECT OR ALGEBRA 349\nThe addition of vectors and the multiplication of a vector by a scalar together give\nthe following distributive laws:\nLet  be any two vectors, and k and m be any scalars. Then\n(i)\n(ii)\n(iii)\nRemarks\n(i)One may observe that whatever be the value of λ, the vector λ is always\ncollinear to the vector . In fact, two vectors  are collinear if and only if\nthere exists a nonzero scalar λ such that .

An other algebraic\noperation which we intend to discuss regarding vectors is their product. We may\nrecall that product of two numbers is a number , product of two matrices is again a\nmatrix. But in case of functions, we may multiply them in two ways, namely ,\nmultiplication of two functions pointwise and composition of two functions. Similarly ,\nmultiplication of two vectors is also defined in two ways, namely , scalar (or dot)\nproduct where the result is a scalar , and vector (or cross) product where the\nresult is a vector . Based upon these two types of products for vectors, they have\nfound various applications in geometry , mechanics and engineering. In this section,\nwe will discuss these two types of products.\n10.6.1   Scalar (or dot) product of two vectors\nDefinition 2  The scalar product of two nonzero vectors , denoted by , isFig 10.18\nReprint 2025-26\n\n MA THEMA TICS 356\ndefined as  =\nwhere, θ is the angle between  (Fig 10.19).\nIf either  then θ is not defined, and in this case, we\ndefine \nObservations\n1.  is a real number .\n2.Let be two nonzero vectors, then  if and only if are\nperpendicular to each other . i.e.\n3.If θ = 0, then \nIn particular ,  as θ in this case is 0.\n4.If θ = π, then | || | ⋅ = −/arrowrightnosp /arrowrightnosp/arrowrightnosp /arrowrightnospa b a b\nIn particular , , as θ  in this case is π.\n5.In view of the Observations 2 and 3, for mutually perpendicular unit vectors\nˆ ˆ ˆ, and ,i j k  we have\nˆ ˆ ˆ ˆi i j j⋅ = ⋅  =ˆ ˆ1, k k⋅ =\nˆ ˆ ˆ ˆi j j k⋅ = ⋅  =ˆˆ0 k i⋅ =\n6.The angle between two nonzero vectors is given by\n or\n7.The scalar product is commutative. i.e.\n          (Why?)\nTwo impor tant pr operties of scalar  product\nProperty 1  (Distributivity of scalar product over addition) Let  be\nany three vectors, thenFig 10.19\nReprint 2025-26\n\nVECT OR ALGEBRA 357\n(i)B\nC AlB\nl\nA C\n(ii)\nA\nBC l\n(iv)l C\nBA\n(iii)θ θθθ\np p\np p\naa a\na(90□<□□□□<□180□)0 0θ (0□<□□□□<□90□)0 0θ\n(270□<□□□□<□360□)0 0θ (180□<□□□□<□270□)0 0θProper ty 2 Let  be any two vectors, and l be any scalar .

The germinal ideas of modern vector theory date from around 1800\nwhen Caspar Wessel (1745-1818) and Jean Robert Argand (1768-1822) described\nthat how a complex number a + ib  could be given a geometric interpretation with\nthe help of a directed line segment in a coordinate plane. William Rowen Hamilton\n(1805-1865) an Irish mathematician was the first to use the term vector for a\ndirected line segment in his book Lectur es on Quaternions (1853). Hamilton’ s\nmethod of quaternions (an ordered set of four real numbers given as:\nˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ , , , a bi cj dk i j k+ + +  following certain algebraic rules) was a solution to the\nproblem of multiplying vectors in three dimensional space. Though, we must\nmention here that in practice, the idea of vector concept and their addition was\nknown much earlier ever since the time of Aristotle (384-322 B.C.), a Greek\nphilosopher , and pupil of Plato (427-348 B.C.). That time it was supposed to be\nknown that the combined action of two or more forces could be seen by adding\nthem according to parallelogram law . The correct law for the composition of\nforces, that forces add vectorially , had been discovered in the case of perpendicular\nforces by S tevin-Simon (1548-1620). In 1586 A.D., he analysed the principle of\ngeometric addition of forces in his treatise DeBeghinselen der W eeghconst\n(“Principles of the Art of Weighing”), which caused a major breakthrough in the\ndevelopment of mechanics. But it took another 200 years for the general concept\nof vectors to form.\nIn the 1880, Josaih Willard Gibbs (1839-1903), an American physicist and\nmathematician, and Oliver Heaviside (1850-1925), an English engineer , created\nwhat we now know as vector analysis , essentially by separating the real ( scalar )\nReprint 2025-26\n\n MA THEMA TICS 376\npart of quaternion from its imaginary ( vector ) part. In 1881 and 1884, Gibbs\nprinted a treatise entitled Element of V ector Analysis . This book gave a systematic\nand concise account of vectors. However , much of the credit for demonstrating\nthe applications of vectors is due to the D. Heaviside and P .G. Tait (1831-1901)\nwho contributed significantly to this subject.\n—/xrhombus/xrhombus/xrhombus/xrhombus/xrhombus—\nReprint 2025-26\n\n",
