They love to ask questions.\nAll kind of questions come to theirminds and they collect them in theirsacks. Sometimes, they may share\nsome of these questions with you, as\nyou read through the chapters.\nPaheli and Boojho are also on the\nlookout for answers to many\nquestions — sometimes the questions\nseem answered after they discussthem with each other, sometimesthrough discussions with other\nclassmates, teachers or their parents.\nAnswers to some questions do notseem available even after all these. They might need to experiment on their own,read books in the library, send questions to scientists. Just dig and dig and dig\ninto all possibilities and see if the questions can be answered. Perhaps, they\nwould carry some of the unanswered questions in their sacks to higher classes.\nWhat will really thrill them would be your adding questions to their sacks  or\nanswers to their questions. Sometimes, activities are suggested in the textbook,\nresults or findings of these by different groups of students would be of interest to\nother students and teachers. You can complete the suggested activities and sendyour results or findings to Paheli and Boojho. Do keep in mind that activitiesthat involve using blades, scissors or fire need to be done strictly under the care\nof your teachers. Stick to the precautions given and then enjoy doing all the\nsuggested activities. Mind, the book will not be able to help you much, if theactivities are not completed!\nWe would like to advise you that you must make observations yourself and\nrecord whatever results you get. Keen and true observations are necessary forexploring any subject of study. For somereason your results may turn out to bedifferent from those of your classmates.\nDo not worry. Try to find out the reason\nfor these results instead of disregardingthem. Do not ever copy results from yourclassmate.\nYou can send your feedback for\nPaheli and Boojho at:A NOTE FOR THE STUDENTS\n \nTo\nThe Head\nDepartment of Education inScience and Mathematics,NCERT, Sri Aurobindo Marg,New Delhi 110 016\nReprint 2024-25\n\nCONSTITUTION OF INDIA\nFundamental Duties\nFundamental Duties – It shall be the duty of every citizen of India —\n(a) to abide by the Constitution and respect its ideals and institutions, the National\nFlag and the National Anthem;\n(b) to cherish and follow the noble ideals which inspired our national struggle for\nfreedom;\n(c) to uphold and protect the sovereignty, unity and integrity of India;(d) to defend the country and render national service when called upon to do so;\n(e) to promote harmony and the spirit of common brotherhood amongst all the people\nof India transcending religious, linguistic and regional or sectional diversities; to\nrenounce practices derogatory to the dignity of women;\n(f) to value and preserve the rich heritage of our composite culture;\n(g) to protect and improve the natural environment including forests, lakes, rivers,\nwildlife and to have compassion for living creatures;\n(h) to develop the scientific temper, humanism and the spirit of inquiry and reform;\n(i) to safeguard public property and to abjure violence;\n(j) to strive towards excellence in all spheres of individual and collective activity so\nthat the nation constantly rises to higher levels of endeavour and achievement;\n(k) who is a parent or guardian, to provide opportunities for education to his child or,\nas the case may be, ward between the age of six and fourteen years.\nPart  IV A (Article  51 A)\nReprint 2024-25\n\nCONTENTS\nFOREWORD iii\nRATIONALISATION  OF CONTENT  IN THE TEXTBOOKS v\nPREFACE vii\nChapter  1\nNutrition in Plants 1\nChapter  2\nNutrition in Animals 11\nChapter  3\nHeat 24\nChapter  4Acids, Bases and Salts 38\nChapter  5\nPhysical and Chemical Changes 47\nChapter  6\nRespiration in Organisms 57\nChapter  7\nTransportation in Animals and Plants 70\nChapter  8\nReproduction in Plants 82\n",
