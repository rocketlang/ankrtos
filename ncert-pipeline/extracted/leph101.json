      "content": "Chapter 1\nof Class XI, Physics Textbook , Part I). In this system, the value of the\nbasic unit of charge is\ne = 1.602192 × 10–19 C\nThus, there are about 6 × 1018 electrons in a charge of  –1C. In\nelectrostatics, charges of this large magnitude are seldom  encountered\nand hence we use smaller units 1 mC (micro coulomb) = 10–6 C or 1 mC\n(milli coulomb) = 10–3 C.\nIf the protons and electrons are the only basic charges in the\nuniverse, all the observable charges have to be integral multiples of e.\nThus, if a body contains n1 electrons and n2 protons, the total amount\nof charge on the body is n2 × e + n1 × (–e) = (n2 – n1) e. Since n1 and n2\nare integers, their dif ference is also an integer . Thus the char ge on any\nbody is always an integral multiple of e and can be increased or\ndecreased also in steps of e.\nThe step size e is, however , very small because at the macr oscopic\nlevel, we deal with charges of a few mC. At this scale the fact that charge of\na body can increase or decrease in units of e is not visible. In this respect,\nthe grainy nature of the charge is lost and it appears to be continuous.\nThis situation can be compared with the geometrical concepts of points\nand lines. A dotted line viewed from a distance appears continuous to\nus but is not continuous in reality. As many points very close to\nReprint 2025-26\n\n6Physics\n EXAMPLE  1.2  EXAMPLE  1.1each other normally give an impression of a continuous line, many\nsmall charges taken together appear as a continuous charge distribution.\nAt the macroscopic level, one deals with charges that are enormous\ncompared to the magnitude of charge e . Since e = 1.6 × 10–19 C, a charge\nof magnituOde, say 1 mC, contains something like 1013 times the electronic\ncharge. At this scale, the fact that charge can increase or decrease only in\nunits of e is not very different from saying that charge can take continuous\nvalues. Thus, at the macroscopic level, the quantisation of charge has no\npractical consequence and can be ignor ed. However , at the micr oscopic\nlevel, where the charges involved are of the order of a few tens or hundreds\nof e, i.e.,  they can be counted, they appear in discrete lumps and\nquantisation of charge cannot be ignored. It is the magnitude of scale\ninvolved that is very important.\nExample 1.1  If 109 electrons move out of a body to another body\nevery second, how much time is required to get a total charge of 1 C\non the other body?\nSolution  In one second 109 electrons move out of the body. Therefore\nthe charge given out in one second is 1.6 × 10–19 × 109 C = 1.6 × 10–10 C.\nThe time required to accumulate a charge of 1 C can then be estimated\nto be 1 C ÷ (1.6 × 10–10 C/s) = 6.25 × 109 s = 6.25 × 109 ÷ (365  × 24 ×\n3600) years = 198 years. Thus to collect a charge of one coulomb,\nfrom a body from which 109 electrons move out every second, we will\nneed approximately 200 years. One coulomb is, therefore, a very large\nunit for many practical purposes.\nIt is, however , also important to know what is r oughly the number of\nelectrons contained in a piece of one cubic centimetre of a material.\nA cubic piece of copper of side 1 cm contains about 2.5 × 1024\nelectrons.\nExample 1.2 How much positive and negative charge is there in a\ncup of water?\nSolution  Let us assume that the mass of one cup of water is\n250 g. The molecular mass of water is 18g. Thus, one mole\n(= 6.02 × 1023 molecules) of water is 18 g. Therefore the number of\nmolecules in one cup of water is (250/18) × 6.02 × 1023.\nEach molecule of water contains two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen\natom, i.e., 10 electrons and 10 protons. Hence the total positive and\ntotal negative charge has the same magnitude. It is equal to\n(250/18) × 6.02 × 1023 × 10 × 1.6 × 10–19 C = 1.3 4 × 107 C.\n1.5  C OULOMB ’S LAW\nCoulomb’s law is a quantitative statement about the force between two\npoint charges. When the linear size of charged bodies are much smaller\nthan the distance separating them, the size may be ignored and the\ncharged bodies are treated as point charges . Coulomb measured the\nforce between two point charges and found that it varied inversely as\nthe square of the distance between the charges and was directly\nproportional to the product of the magnitude of the two charges and\nReprint 2025-26\n\nElectric Charges\nand Fields\n7acted along the line joining the two charges . Thus, if two\npoint charges q1, q2 are separated by a distance r in vacuum,\nthe magnitude of the force ( F) between them is given by\n2 1\n2q qF kr= (1.1)\nHow did Coulomb arrive at this law from his experiments?\nCoulomb used a torsion balance *  for measuring the force\nbetween two charged metallic spheres. When the separation\nbetween two spheres is much larger than the radius of each\nsphere, the charged spheres may be regarded as point charges.\nHowever , the char ges on the spher es wer e unknown, to begin\nwith. How then could he discover a relation like Eq. (1.1)?\nCoulomb thought of the following simple way: Suppose the\ncharge on a metallic sphere is q. If the sphere is put in contact\nwith an identical uncharged sphere, the charge will spread over\nthe two spheres. By symmetry, the charge on each sphere will\nbe q/2*. Repeating this process, we can get charges q/2, q/4,\netc. Coulomb varied the distance for a fixed pair of charges and\nmeasured the force for different separations. He then varied the\ncharges in pairs, keeping the distance fixed for each pair .\nComparing forces for different pairs of  charges at different\ndistances, Coulomb arrived at the relation, Eq. (1.1).\nCoulomb’s law, a simple mathematical statement,  was\ninitially experimentally arrived at  in the manner described\nabove. While the original experiments established it at a\nmacroscopic scale, it has also been established down to\nsubatomic level  ( r ~ 10–10 m).\nCoulomb discovered his law without knowing the explicit\nmagnitude of the charge. In fact, it is the other way round:\nCoulomb’s law can now be employed to furnish a definition\nfor a unit of charge. In the relation, Eq. (1.1), k is so far\narbitrary. W e can choose any positive value of k. The choice\nof k determines the size of the unit of charge. In SI units, the\nvalue of k is about 9 × 109 2\n2Nm\nC. The unit of charge that\nresults from this choice is called a coulomb which we defined\nearlier in Section 1.4. Putting this value of k in Eq. (1.1), we\nsee that for q1 = q2 = 1 C, r = 1 m\nF = 9 × 109 N\nThat is, 1 C is the charge that when placed at a distance\nof 1 m from another charge of the same magnitude in vacuum\nexperiences an electrical force of repulsion of magnitude\n*A torsion balance is a sensitive device to measure force. It was also used later\nby Cavendish to measure the very feeble gravitational force between two objects,\nto verify Newton’s Law of Gravitation.\n*Implicit in this is the assumption of additivity of charges and conservation:\ntwo charges ( q/2 each) add up to make a total charge  q.Charles Augustin de\nCoulomb (1736 – 1806)\nCoulomb, a French\nphysicist, began his\ncareer as a military\nengineer in the W est\nIndies. In 1776, he\nreturned to Paris and\nretired to a small estate\nto do his scientific\nresearch. He invented a\ntorsion balance to\nmeasure the quantity of\na force and used it for\ndetermination of forces\nof electric attraction or\nrepulsion between small\ncharged spheres. He\nthus arrived in 1785 at\nthe inverse square law\nrelation, now known as\nCoulomb’s law. The law\nhad been anticipated by\nPriestley and also by\nCavendish earlier ,\nthough Cavendish\nnever published his\nresults. Coulomb also\nfound the inverse\nsquare law of force\nbetween unlike and like\nmagnetic poles.\nCHARLES AUGUSTIN DE COULOMB  (1736 –1806)\nReprint 2025-26\n\n8Physics\n9 × 109 N. One coulomb is evidently too big a unit to\nbe used. In practice, in electrostatics, one uses\nsmaller units like 1 mC or 1 mC.\nThe constant k in Eq. (1.1) is usually put as\nk = 1/4 pe0 for later convenience, so that Coulomb’s\nlaw is written as\n01 2\n21\n4q qFrε=π(1.2)\ne0 is called the permittivity of fr ee space . The value\nof e0 in SI units is\n0= 8.854 × 10–12 C2 N–1m–2\nSince for ce is a vector , it is better to write\nCoulomb’s law in the vector notation. Let the position\nvectors of charges q1 and q2 be r1 and r2 respectively\n[see Fig.1.3(a)]. W e denote for ce on q1 due to q2 by\nF12 and force on q2 due to q1 by F21. The two point\ncharges q1 and q2 have been numbered 1 and 2 for\nconvenience and the vector leading from 1 to 2 is\ndenoted by r21:\nr21 = r2 – r1\nIn the same way, the vector leading from 2 to 1 is denoted by r12:\nr12 = r1 – r2 = – r21\nThe magnitude of the vectors r21 and r12 is denoted by r21 and r12,\nrespectively ( r12 = r21). The direction of a vector is specified by a unit\nvector along the vector . To denote the dir ection fr om 1 to 2 (or fr om 2 to\n1), we define the unit vectors:\nɵ 2121\n21=rrr, ɵɵ ɵ 1212 21 12\n12,= −rr r r\nr\nCoulomb’s force law between two point charges q1 and q2 located at\nr1 and r2, respectively is then expressed as\nɵ 1 22121 2\n211\n4ε=πF r\noq q\nr(1.3)\nSome remarks on Eq. (1.3) are relevant:\n·Equation (1.3) is valid for any sign of q1 and q2 whether positive or\nnegative. If q1 and q2 are of the same sign (either both positive or both\nnegative), F21 is along  ˆr21, which denotes repulsion, as it should be for\nlike charges. If q1 and q2 are of opposite signs, F21 is along –ɵr21(=ɵr12),\nwhich denotes attraction, as expected for unlike charges. Thus, we do\nnot have to write separate equations for the cases of like and unlike\ncharges. Equation (1.3) takes care of both cases correctly [Fig. 1. 3(b)].FIGURE  1.3 (a) Geometry and\n(b) Forces between charges.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nElectric Charges\nand Fields\n",

The resulting repulsion of A\nis noted (for example, by shining a beam of light and measuring the\ndeflection of its shadow on a screen). Spheres A and B are touched\nby uncharged spheres C and D respectively, as shown in Fig. 1.4(b).\nC and D are then removed and B is brought closer to A to a\ndistance of 5.0 cm between their centres, as shown in Fig. 1.4(c).\nWhat is the expected repulsion of A on the basis of Coulomb’s law?\nSpheres A and C and spheres B and D have identical sizes.

How to calculate the force on a charge where\nthere are not one but several charges around? Consider a\nsystem of n stationary charges q1, q2, q3, ..., qn in vacuum.\nWhat is the force on q1 due to q2, q3, ..., qn? Coulomb’s law is\nnot enough to answer this question.  Recall that forces of\nmechanical origin add according to the parallelogram law of\naddition. Is the same true for forces of electrostatic origin?\nExperimentally, it is verified that force on any charge  due\nto a number of other charges is the vector sum of all the forces\non that charge due to the  other charges, taken one at a time.\nThe individual forces are unaffected due to the presence of\nother charges . This is termed as the principle of superposition .\nTo better understand the concept, consider a system of\nthree charges q1, q2 and q3, as shown in Fig. 1.5(a) . The force\non one charge, say q1, due to two other charges q2, q3 can\ntherefore be obtained by performing a vector addition of the\nforces due to each one of these charges. Thus, if the force on q1\ndue to q2 is denoted by F12, F12 is given by Eq.

It follows straight from the fact\nthat Coulomb’s law is consistent with Newton’s third law. The proof\nis left to you as an exercise.\n1.7  E LECTRIC  FIELD\nLet us consider a point charge Q placed in vacuum, at the origin O. If we\nplace another point char ge q at a point P , wher e OP = r, then the char ge Q\nwill exert a for ce on q as per Coulomb’s law. W e may ask the question: If\ncharge q is removed, then what is left in the surrounding? Is there\nnothing? If ther e is nothing at the point P , then how does a for ce act\nwhen we place the char ge q at P. In or der to answer such questions, the\nearly scientists introduced the concept of field. According to this, we say\nthat the charge Q produces an electric field everywhere in the surrounding.\nWhen another char ge q is brought at some point P , the field ther e acts on\nit and produces a force. The electric field produced by the charge Q  at a\npoint r is given as\nE r r r ()= =1\n41\n402\n02π πε εQ\nrQ\nrˆ ˆ(1.6)\nwhere ˆ=r r/r, is a unit vector fr om the origin to the point r. Thus, Eq.(1.6)\nspecifies the value of the electric field for each value of the position\nvector r. The wor d “field” signifies how some distributed quantity (which\ncould be a scalar or a vector) varies with position. The effect of the charge\nhas been incorporated in the existence of the electric field. W e obtain the\nforce F exerted by a charge  Q on a charge q, as\nF r =1\n402πεQq\nrˆ(1.7)\nNote that the charge q also exerts an equal and opposite force on the\ncharge Q. The electrostatic force between the charges Q and q can be\nlooked upon as an interaction between charge q and the electric field of\nQ and vice versa. If we denote the position of char ge q by the vector r, it\nexperiences a force F equal to the charge q multiplied by the electric\nfield E at the location of q. Thus,\nF(r) = q E(r) (1.8)\nEquation (1.8) defines the SI unit of electric field as N/C *.\nSome important remarks may be made here:\n(i)From Eq. (1.8), we can infer that if q is unity, the electric field due to\na charge Q is numerically equal to the force exerted by it. Thus, the\nelectric field due to a charge  Q at a point in space may be defined\nas the force that a unit positive charge would experience if placed\n*An alter nate unit V/m will be intr oduced in the next chapter .FIGURE  1.8 Electric\nfield (a) due to a\ncharge Q, (b) due to a\ncharge –Q.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nElectric Charges\nand Fields\n15at that point . The charge Q, which is producing the electric field, is\ncalled a source charge  and the charge q, which tests the effect of a\nsource charge, is called a test charge . Note that the source charge Q\nmust r emain at its original location. However , if a char ge q is brought\nat any point around  Q, Q itself is bound to experience an electrical\nforce due to q and will tend to move. A way out of this difficulty is to\nmake q negligibly small. The force F is then negligibly small but the\nratio F/q is finite and defines the electric field:\nEF=\n\n→lim\nq q0(1.9)\nA practical way to get around the problem (of keeping Q undisturbed\nin the presence of q) is to hold Q to its location by unspecified forces!\nThis may look strange but actually this is what happens in practice.\nWhen we are considering the electric force on a test charge q due to a\ncharged planar sheet (Section 1.14), the charges on the sheet are held to\ntheir locations by the forces due to the unspecified charged constituents\ninside the sheet.\n(ii)Note that the electric field E due to Q, though defined operationally in\nterms of some test charge q, is independent of q. This is because\nF is proportional to q, so the ratio F/q does not depend on q. The\nforce F on the charge q due to the charge Q depends on the particular\nlocation of charge q which may take any value in the space around\nthe charge Q. Thus, the electric field E due to Q is also dependent on\nthe space coor dinate r. For dif ferent positions of the char ge q all over\nthe space , we get different values of electric field E. The field exists at\nevery point in three-dimensional space.\n(iii)For a positive charge, the electric field will be directed radially\noutwards from the charge. On the other hand, if the source charge is\nnegative, the electric field vector , at each point, points radially inwar ds.\n(iv)Since the magnitude of the force F on charge q due to charge Q\ndepends only on the distance r of the charge q from charge Q,\nthe magnitude of the electric field E will also depend only on the\ndistance r. Thus at equal distances fr om the char ge Q, the magnitude\nof its electric field E is same.  The magnitude of electric field E \ndue to\na point charge is thus same on a sphere with the point charge at its\ncentre; in other words, it has a spherical symmetry.\n1.7.1  Electric field due to a system of charges\nConsider a system of charges q1, q2, ..., qn with  position vectors r1,\nr2, ..., rn relative  to some origin O. Like the electric field at a point in\nspace due to a single charge, electric field at a point in space due to the\nsystem of charges is defined to be the force experienced by a unit\ntest charge placed at that point, without disturbing the original\npositions of char ges q1, q2, ..., qn. We can use Coulomb’s law and the\nsuperposition principle to determine this field at a point P denoted by\nposition vector r.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n16Physics\nElectric field E1 at r due to q1 at r1 is given by\nE1 = 1\n401\n12πεq\nrP1Pˆr\nwher e 1Pˆr is a unit vector in the dir ection fr om q1 to P,\nand r1P is the distance between q1 and P .\nIn the same manner , electric field E2 at r due to q2 at\nr2 is\nE2 = 1\n402\n22πεq\nrP2Pˆr\nwhere 2Pˆr is a unit vector in the direction from q2 to P\nand r2P is the distance between q2 and P . Similar\nexpressions hold good for fields E3, E4, ..., En due to\ncharges q3, q4, ..., qn.\nBy the superposition principle, the electric field E at r\ndue to the system of charges is (as shown in Fig. 1.9)\nE(r)  =  E1 (r) +  E2 (r)  + …  +  En(r)\n        =1\n41\n41\n401\n121\n02\n222\n02π π π ε ε εq\nrq\nrq\nrn\nnn\nPP\nPP\nPPˆ ˆ... ˆ r r r + + +\nE(r) =\n=∑  1\n40 Pi Pπεq\nri\ni in\n2\n1ˆr (1.10)\nE is a vector quantity that varies from one point to another point in space\nand is determined from the positions of the source charges.\n1.7.2  Physical significance of electric field\nYou may wonder why the notion of electric field has been intr oduced\nhere at all. After all, for any system of charges, the measurable quantity\nis the force on a charge which can be directly determined using Coulomb’s\nlaw and the superposition principle [Eq. (1.5)]. Why then introduce this\nintermediate quantity called the electric field?\nFor electrostatics, the concept of electric field is convenient, but not\nreally necessary. Electric field is an elegant way of characterising the\nelectrical environment of a system of charges. Electric field at a point in\nthe space around a system of charges tells you the force a unit positive\ntest charge would experience if placed at that point (without disturbing\nthe system). Electric field is a characteristic of the system of charges and\nis independent of the test charge that you place at a point to determine\nthe field. The term field in physics generally refers to a quantity that is\ndefined at every point in space and may vary from point to point. Electric\nfield is a vector field, since force is a vector quantity.\nThe true physical significance of the concept of electric field, however ,\nemerges only when we go beyond electrostatics and deal with time-\ndependent electromagnetic phenomena. Suppose we consider the force\nbetween two distant charges q1, q2 in accelerated motion. Now the greatest\nspeed with which a signal or information can go from one point to another\nis c, the speed of light. Thus, the effect of any motion of q1 on q2 cannotFIGURE  1.9 Electric field at a point\ndue to a system of charges is the\nvector sum of the electric fields at\nthe point due to individual charges.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nElectric Charges\nand Fields\n17arise instantaneously. There will be some time delay between the effect\n(force on q2) and the cause (motion of q1). It is precisely here that the\nnotion of electric field (strictly, electromagnetic field) is natural and very\nuseful. The field picture is this: the accelerated motion of charge q1\nproduces electromagnetic waves, which then propagate with the speed\nc, reach q2 and cause a force on q2. The notion of field elegantly accounts\nfor the time delay. Thus, even though electric and magnetic fields can be\ndetected only by their effects (forces) on charges, they are regarded as\nphysical entities, not merely mathematical constructs. They have an\nindependent dynamics of their own,  i.e., they evolve according to laws\nof their own. They can also transport energy. Thus, a source of time-\ndependent electromagnetic fields, turned on for a short interval of time\nand then switched off, leaves behind propagating electromagnetic fields\ntransporting energy. The concept of field was first introduced by Faraday\nand is now among the central concepts in physics.\nExample 1.7 An electron falls through a distance of 1.5 cm in a\nuniform electric field of magnitude 2.0 × 104 N C–1 [Fig. 1.10(a)]. The\ndirection of the field is reversed keeping its magnitude unchanged\nand a proton falls through the same distance [Fig. 1.10(b)]. Compute\nthe time of fall in each case. Contrast the situation with that of ‘free\nfall under gravity’.\nFIGURE  1.10\nSolution In Fig. 1.10(a) the field is upward, so the negatively charged\nelectron experiences a downward force of magnitude eE where E is\nthe magnitude of the electric field. The acceleration of the electron is\nae  =  eE/me\nwhere me is the mass of the electron.\nStarting from rest, the time required by the electron to fall through a\ndistance h is given by  2 2\nee\neh m hta e E= =\nFor e = 1.6 × 10–19C, me = 9.11 × 10–31 kg,\n     E = 2.0 × 104 N C–1, h = 1.5 × 10–2 m,\n  te = 2.9 × 10–9s\nIn Fig. 1.10 (b), the field is downward, and the positively charged\nproton experiences a downward force of magnitude eE. The\nacceleration of the proton is\nap  =  eE/mp\nwhere mp is the mass of the proton; mp = 1.67 × 10–27 kg. The time of\nfall for the proton is EXAMPLE  1.7\nReprint 2025-26\n\n18Physics\n EXAMPLE  1.8  EXAMPLE  1.7–72 21 3 10 sp\np\nph m ht .a e E== = ×\nThus, the heavier particle (proton) takes a greater time to fall through\nthe same distance. This is in basic contrast to the situation of ‘free\nfall under gravity’ where the time of fall is independent of the mass of\nthe body. Note that in this example we have ignored the acceleration\ndue to gravity in calculating the time of fall. To see if this is justified,\nlet us calculate the acceleration of the proton in the given electric\nfield:\np\npe Eam=\n     19 4 1\n27(1 6 10 C) (2 0 10 N C )\n1 67 10 kg. .\n.− −\n−× × ×=×\n     12 –21 9 10 m s.= ×\nwhich is enormous compared to the value of g (9.8 m s–2), the\nacceleration due to gravity. The acceleration of the electron is even\ngreater . Thus, the ef fect of acceleration due to gravity can be ignor ed\nin this example.\nExample 1.8  Two point charges q1 and q2, of magnitude +10–8 C and\n–10–8 C, respectively, are placed 0.1 m apart.

It is a vector quantity\nand can be represented as we represent vectors. Let us try to represent E\ndue to a point charge pictorially. Let the point charge be placed at the\norigin. Draw vectors pointing along the direction of the\nelectric field with their lengths proportional to the strength\nof the field at each point. Since the magnitude of electric\nfield at a point decreases inversely as the square of the\ndistance of that point from the charge, the vector gets\nshorter as one goes away from the origin, always pointing\nradially outward. Figure 1.12 shows such a picture.  In\nthis figure, each arrow indicates the electric field, i.e., the\nforce acting on a unit positive charge, placed at the tail of\nthat arrow.  Connect the arrows pointing in one direction\nand the r esulting figur e represents a field line. W e thus\nget many field lines, all pointing outwards from the point\ncharge. Have we lost the information about the strength\nor magnitude of the field now, because it was contained\nin the length of the arrow? No. Now the magnitude of the\nfield is represented by the density of field lines. E is strong\nnear the charge, so the density of field lines is more near\nthe char ge and the lines ar e closer . Away fr om the char ge,\nthe field gets weaker and the density of field lines is less,\nresulting in well-separated lines.\nAnother person may draw more lines. But the number of lines is not\nimportant. In fact, an infinite number of lines can be drawn in any region.FIGURE  1.12 Field of a point charge. EXAMPLE  1.8\nReprint 2025-26\n\n20Physics\nIt is the relative density of lines in different regions which is\nimportant.\nWe draw the figur e on the plane of paper , i.e., in two-\ndimensions but we live in three-dimensions. So if one wishes\nto estimate the density of field lines, one has to consider the\nnumber of lines per unit cross-sectional area, perpendicular\nto the lines.  Since the electric field decreases as the square of\nthe distance from a point charge and the area enclosing the\ncharge increases as the square of the distance, the number\nof field lines crossing the enclosing area remains constant,\nwhatever may be the distance of the area from the charge.\nWe started by saying that the field lines carry infor mation\nabout the direction of electric field at different points in space.\nHaving drawn a certain set of field lines, the relative density\n(i.e., closeness) of the field lines at different points indicates\nthe relative strength of electric field at those points. The field\nlines crowd where the field is strong and are spaced apart\nwher e it is weak. Figur e 1.13 shows a set of field lines. W e\ncan imagine two equal and small elements of area placed at points R and\nS normal to the field lines there. The number of field lines in our picture\ncutting the area elements is proportional to the magnitude of field at\nthese points. The picture shows that the field at R is stronger than at S.\nTo understand the dependence of the field lines on the area, or rather\nthe solid angle subtended by an area element, let us try to relate the\narea with the solid angle, a generalisation of angle to three dimensions.\nRecall how a (plane) angle is defined in two-dimensions. Let a small\ntransverse line element D l be placed at a distance \nr from a point O. Then\nthe angle subtended by Dl  at O can be appr oximated as Dq = Dl/r.\nLikewise, in three-dimensions the solid angle * subtended by a small\nperpendicular plane ar ea DS, at a distance r, can be written as\nDW = DS/r2. We know that in a given solid angle the number of radial\nfield lines is the same. In Fig. 1.13, for two points P1 and P2 at distances\nr1 and r2 from the charge, the element of area subtending the solid angle\nDW is 2\n1rDW at P1 and an element of area 2\n2rDW at P2, respectively. The\nnumber of lines (say n) cutting these area elements are the same. The\nnumber of field lines, cutting unit area element is therefore n/(2\n1rDW) at\nP1 and n/(2\n2rDW) at P2, respectively. Since n and DW are common, the\nstrength of the field clearly has a 1/ r2 dependence.\nThe picture of field lines was invented by Faraday to develop an\nintuitive non-mathematical way of visualising electric fields around\ncharged configurations. Faraday called them lines of for ce. This ter m is\nsomewhat misleading, especially in case of magnetic fields. The more\nappr opriate ter m is field lines  (electric or magnetic) that we have\nadopted in this book.\nElectric field lines are thus a way of pictorially mapping the electric\nfield around a configuration of charges. An electric field line is, in general,FIGURE  1.13  Dependence of\nelectric field strength on the\ndistance and its relation to the\nnumber of field lines.\n*Solid angle is a measure of a cone. Consider the intersection of the given cone\nwith a sphere of radius R. The solid angle DW of the cone is defined to be equal\nto DS/R2, where DS is the area on the sphere cut out by the cone.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nElectric Charges\nand Fields\n21a curve drawn in such a way that the tangent to it at each\npoint is in the direction of the net field at that point. An\narrow on the curve is obviously necessary to specify the\ndirection of electric field from the two possible directions\nindicated by a tangent to the curve. A field line is a space\ncurve, i.e., a curve in three dimensions.\nFigure 1.14 shows the field lines around some simple\ncharge configurations. As mentioned earlier , the field lines\nare in 3-dimensional space, though the figure shows them\nonly in a plane. The field lines of a single positive charge\nare radially outward while those of a single negative\ncharge are radially inward. The field lines around a system\nof two positive charges ( q, q) give a vivid pictorial\ndescription of their mutual repulsion, while those around\nthe configuration of two equal and opposite charges\n(q, –q), a dipole, show clearly the mutual attraction\nbetween the charges. The field lines follow some important\ngeneral properties:\n(i)Field lines start from positive charges and end at\nnegative charges. If there is a single charge, they may\nstart or end at infinity.\n(ii)In a charge-free region, electric field lines can be taken\nto be continuous curves without any breaks.\n(iii)Two field lines can never cr oss each other . (If they did,\nthe field at the point of intersection will not have a\nunique direction, which is absurd.)\n(iv)Electrostatic field lines do not form any closed loops.\nThis follows from the conservative nature of electric\nfield (Chapter 2).\n1.9  E LECTRIC  FLUX\nConsider flow of a liquid with velocity v, through a small\nflat surface d S, in a direction normal to the surface. The\nrate of flow of liquid is given by the volume crossing the\narea per unit time  v dS and represents the flux of liquid\nflowing across the plane. If the normal to the surface is\nnot parallel to the direction of flow of liquid, i.e., to v, but\nmakes an angle q with it, the projected area in a plane\nperpendicular to v is δdS cos q. Therefore, the flux going\nout of the surface d S is v.ˆndS. For the case of  the electric\nfield, we define an analogous quantity and call it electric\nflux. We should, however , note that ther e is no flow of a\nphysically observable quantity unlike the case of\nliquid flow.\nIn the picture of electric field lines described above,\nwe saw that the number of field lines crossing a unit area,\nplaced normal to the field at a point is a measure of the\nstrength of electric field at that point. This means that ifFIGURE  1.14 Field lines due to\nsome simple charge configurations.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n22Physics\nwe place a small planar element of area DS\nnormal to E at a point, the number of field lines\ncrossing it is proportional * to E DS. Now\nsuppose we tilt the area element by angle q.\nClearly, the number of field lines crossing the\narea element will be smaller . The pr ojection of\nthe area element normal to E is DS cos q. Thus,\nthe number of field lines crossing DS is\nproportional to E DS cos q. When q = 90°, field\nlines will be parallel to DS and will not cross it\nat all (Fig. 1.15).\nThe orientation of area element and not\nmerely its magnitude is important in many\ncontexts. For example, in a stream, the amount\nof water flowing through a ring will naturally\ndepend on how you hold the ring. If you hold\nit normal to the flow, maximum water will flow\nthrough it than if you hold it with some other\norientation. This shows that an area element\nshould be tr eated as a vector . It has a\nmagnitude and also a direction. How to specify the direction of a planar\narea? Clearly, the normal to the plane specifies the orientation of the\nplane. Thus the direction of a planar area vector is along its normal.\nHow to associate a vector to the ar ea of a curved sur face? W e imagine\ndividing the surface into a large number of very small area elements.\nEach small area element may be treated as planar and a vector associated\nwith it, as explained before.\nNotice one ambiguity here. The direction of an area element is along\nits normal. But a normal can point in two directions. Which direction do\nwe choose as the direction of the vector associated with the area element?\nThis problem is resolved by some convention appropriate to the given\ncontext. For the case of a closed surface, this convention is very simple.\nThe vector associated with every area element of a closed surface is taken\nto be in the direction of the outward  normal. This is the convention used\nin Fig. 1.16. Thus, the area element vector DS at a point on a closed\nsurface equals DS ˆn where D S is the magnitude of the area element and\nˆn is a unit vector in the direction of outward normal at that point.\nWe now come to the definition of electric flux. Electric flux Df through\nan area element DS is defined by\nDf = E.DS = E DS  cos q (1.11)\nwhich, as seen before, is proportional to the number of field lines cutting\nthe area element. The angle q here is the angle between E and DS. For a\nclosed surface, with the convention stated already, q is the angle between\nE and the outward normal   to the area element. Notice we could look at\nthe expression E DS cos q  in two ways:  E ( DS cos q ) i.e., E times theFIGURE  1.15  Dependence of flux on the\ninclination q between E and ˆn.\nFIGURE  1.16\nConvention for\ndefining normal\nˆn and DS. *It will not be proper to say that the number of field lines is equal to E DS. The\nnumber of field lines is after all, a matter of how many field lines we choose to\ndraw. What is physically significant is the relative number of field lines crossing\na given area at different points.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nElectric Charges\nand Fields\n23projection of area normal to E,  or E^ DS, i.e., component of E along the\nnormal to the area element times the magnitude of the area element. The\nunit of electric flux is N C–1 m2.\nThe basic definition of electric flux given by Eq. (1.11) can be used, in\nprinciple, to calculate the total flux through any given surface. All we\nhave to do is to divide the surface into small area elements, calculate the\nflux at each element and add them up. Thus, the total flux f through a\nsurface S is\nf ~ S E.DS (1.12)\nThe approximation sign is put because the electric field E is taken to\nbe constant over the small area element. This is mathematically exact\nonly when you take the limit DS ® 0  and the sum in Eq. (1.12) is written\nas an integral.\n1.10  E LECTRIC  DIPOLE\nAn electric dipole is a pair of equal and opposite point charges q and – q,\nseparated by a distance 2\na. The line connecting the two charges defines\na direction in space. By convention, the direction from – q to q is said to\nbe the direction of the dipole. The mid-point of locations of – q and q is\ncalled the centre of the dipole.\nThe total charge of the electric dipole is obviously zero. This does not\nmean that the field of the electric dipole is zero. Since the charge q and\n–q are separated by some distance, the electric fields due to them, when\nadded, do not exactly cancel out. However , at distances much lar ger than\nthe separation of the two charges forming a dipole ( r >> 2 a), the fields\ndue to q and – q nearly cancel out. The electric field due to a dipole\ntherefore falls off, at large distance, faster than like 1/ r2 (the dependence\non r of the field due to a single charge q). These qualitative ideas are\nborne out by the explicit calculation as follows:\n1.10.1  The field of an electric dipole\nThe electric field of the pair of charges (– q and q) at any point in space\ncan be found out from Coulomb’s law and the superposition principle.\nThe results are simple for the following two cases: (i) when the point is on\nthe dipole axis, and (ii) when it is in the equatorial plane  of the dipole,\ni.e.,  on a plane perpendicular to the dipole axis through its centre.  The\nelectric field at any general point P is obtained by adding the electric\nfields E–q due to the charge – q and E+q due to the charge q, by the\nparallelogram law of vectors.\n(i) For points on the axis\nLet the point P be at distance r from the centre of the dipole on the side of\nthe charge q,  as shown in Fig. 1.17(a).

Clearly, the components normal to the dipole\naxis cancel away. The components along the dipole axis\nadd up. The total electric field is opposite to ˆp.

(1.15) and (1.18), it is clear that the dipole field at large\ndistances does not involve q and a separately; it depends on the product\nqa. This suggests the definition of dipole moment. The dipole moment\nvector  p of an electric dipole is defined by\np  = q × 2a ˆp (1.19)\nthat is, it is a vector whose magnitude is charge q times the separation\n2a (between the pair of charges q, –q) and the direction is along the line\nfrom – q to q.

Such a dipole is referred to as a point dipole . For a\npoint dipole, Eqs. (1.20) and (1.21) ar e exact, true for any r.\n1.10.2  Physical significance of dipoles\nIn most molecules, the centres of positive charges and of negative charges *\nlie at the same place. Therefore, their dipole moment is zero. CO2 and\nCH4 are of this type of molecules. However , they develop a dipole moment\nwhen an electric field is applied. But in some molecules, the centres of\nnegative charges and of positive charges do not coincide. Therefore they\nhave a permanent electric dipole moment, even in the absence of an electric\nfield. Such molecules are called polar molecules. W ater molecules, H2O,\nis an example of this type.

(By permanent dipole, we\nmean that p exists  irrespective of E; it has not been induced by E.)\nThere is a force qE on q and a force – qE on – q. The net force on\nthe dipole is zer o, since E is unifor m. However , the char ges ar e\nseparated, so the forces act at different points, resulting in a torque\non the dipole. When the net force is zero, the torque (couple) is\nindependent of the origin. Its magnitude equals the magnitude of\neach force multiplied by the arm of the couple (perpendicular\ndistance between the two antiparallel forces).\nMagnitude of torque = q E × 2 a sinq\n       = 2 q a E  sinq\nIts dir ection is nor mal to the plane of the paper , coming out of it.\nThe magnitude of p × E is also p E sinq and its direction\nis nor mal to the paper , coming out of it. Thus,\nt tt tt  = p × E (1.22)\nThis torque will tend to align the dipole with the field\nE. When p is aligned with E, the torque is zero.\nWhat happens if the field is not uniform? In that case,\nthe net force will evidently be non-zero. In addition there\nwill, in general, be a torque on the system as before. The\ngeneral case is involved, so let us consider the simpler\nsituations when p is parallel to E or antiparallel to E. In\neither case, the net torque is zero, but there is a net force\non the dipole if E is not uniform.\nFigure 1.20 is self-explanatory. It is easily seen that\nwhen p is parallel to E, the dipole has a net force in the\ndirection of increasing field. When p is antiparallel to E,\nthe net force on the dipole is in the direction of decreasing\nfield. In general, the force depends on the orientation of p\nwith respect to E.\nThis brings us to a common observation in frictional\nelectricity. A comb run through dry hair attracts pieces of\npaper . The comb, as we know, acquir es char ge thr ough\nfriction. But the paper is not charged. What then explains\nthe attractive force? Taking the clue from the precedingFIGURE  1.19 Dipole in a\nuniform electric field.\nFIGURE  1.20 Electric force on a\ndipole: (a) E parallel to p, (b)  E\nantiparallel to p.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n28Physics\ndiscussion, the char ged comb ‘polarises’ the piece of paper , i.e., induces\na net dipole moment in the dir ection of field. Further , the electric field\ndue to the comb is not uniform. This non-uniformity of the field makes a\ndipole to experience a net force on it. In this situation, it is easily seen\nthat the paper should move in the direction of the comb!\n1.12  C ONTINUOUS  CHARGE  DISTRIBUTION\nWe have so far dealt with char ge configurations involving discr ete char ges\nq1, q2, ..., qn. One reason why we restricted to discrete charges is that the\nmathematical treatment is simpler and does not involve calculus. For\nmany purposes, however , it is impractical to work in ter ms of discr ete\ncharges and we need to work with continuous charge distributions. For\nexample, on the sur face of a char ged conductor , it is impractical to specify\nthe charge distribution in terms of the locations of the microscopic charged\nconstituents. It is more feasible to consider an area element DS (Fig. 1.21)\non the surface of the conductor (which is very small on the macroscopic\nscale but big enough to include a very large number of electrons) and\nspecify the char ge DQ on that element. W e then define a surface char ge\ndensity  s at the area element by\nQ\nSσΔ=Δ(1.23)\nWe can do this at dif ferent points on the conductor and thus arrive at\na continuous function s, called the surface charge density. The surface\ncharge density s  so defined ignores the quantisation of charge and the\ndiscontinuity in charge distribution at the microscopic level *. s  represents\nmacroscopic surface charge density, which in a sense, is a smoothed out\naverage of the microscopic charge density over an area element DS which,\nas said before, is large microscopically but small macroscopically. The\nunits for s are C/m2.\nSimilar considerations apply for a line charge distribution and a volume\ncharge distribution. The linear charge density  l of a wire is defined by\nQ\nlλΔ=Δ(1.24)\nwhere Dl is a small line element of wire on the macroscopic scale that,\nhowever , includes a lar ge number of micr oscopic char ged constituents,\nand DQ is the charge contained in that line element. The units for l are\nC/m. The volume charge density  (sometimes simply called charge density)\nis defined in a similar manner:\nQ\nVρΔ=Δ(1.25)\nwhere DQ is the charge included in the macroscopically small volume\nelement DV that includes a large number of microscopic charged\nconstituents. The units for r are C/m3.\nThe notion of continuous charge distribution is similar to that we\nadopt for continuous mass distribution in mechanics. When we refer toFIGURE  1.21\nDefinition of linear ,\nsurface and volume\ncharge densities.\nIn each case, the\nelement ( Dl, DS, DV)\nchosen is small on\nthe macroscopic\nscale but contains\na very large number\nof microscopic\nconstituents.\n*At the microscopic level, charge distribution is discontinuous, because they are\ndiscrete charges separated by intervening space where there is no charge.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nElectric Charges\nand Fields\n29the density of a liquid, we are referring to its macroscopic density. We\nregard it as a continuous fluid and ignore its discrete molecular\nconstitution.\nThe field due to a continuous charge distribution can be obtained in\nmuch the same way as for a system of discrete charges, Eq. (1.10). Suppose\na continuous char ge distribution in space has a char ge density r. Choose\nany convenient origin O and let the position vector of any point in the\ncharge distribution be r. The char ge density r may vary fr om point to\npoint, i.e., it is a function of r. Divide the char ge distribution into small\nvolume elements of size DV. The char ge in a volume element DV is rDV.\nNow, consider any general point P (inside or outside the distribution)\nwith position vector R (Fig. 1.21). Electric field due to the charge rDV is\ngiven by Coulomb’s law:\n2\n01ˆ\n4V'r'ρ\nεΔΔ =πE r (1.26)\nwher e r¢ is the distance between the char ge element and P , and  ˆr¢ is a\nunit vector in the dir ection fr om the char ge element to P . By the\nsuperposition principle, the total electric field due to the charge\ndistribution is obtained by summing over electric fields due to different\nvolume elements:\n2\n01ˆ\n4all VV'r'ρ\nεΔΔ≅ ΣπE r (1.27)\nNote that r, r¢,  ˆ′r all can vary fr om point to point. In a strict\nmathematical method, we should let DV®0 and the sum then becomes\nan integral; but we omit that discussion here, for simplicity. In short,\nusing Coulomb’s law and the superposition principle, electric field can\nbe determined for any charge distribution, discrete or continuous or part\ndiscrete and part continuous.\n1.13  G AUSS’S LAW\nAs a simple application of the notion of electric flux, let us consider the\ntotal flux thr ough a spher e of radius r, which encloses a point char ge q\nat its centre. Divide the sphere into small area elements, as shown in\nFig. 1.22.\nThe flux through an area element DS is\n2\n0ˆ\n4q\nrφεΔ = Δ = ΔπE S r Sii (1.28)\nwhere we have used Coulomb’s law for the electric field due to a single\ncharge q. The unit vector ˆr is along the radius vector from the centre to\nthe area element. Now, since the normal to a sphere at every point is\nalong the radius vector at that point, the area element DS and ˆr  have\nthe same direction. Therefore,\n2\n04qSrφεΔ = Δπ(1.29)\nsince the magnitude of a unit vector is 1.\nThe total flux through the sphere is obtained by adding up flux\nthrough all the different area elements:FIGURE  1.22  Flux\nthrough a sphere\nenclosing a point\ncharge q at its centre.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n30Physics\n2\n04all SqSrφεΔ= Σ Δπ\nSince each area element of the sphere is at the same\ndistance r from the charge,\n2 2\n0 4 4all Soq qS Sr rφε εΔ= Σ Δ =π π\nNow S, the total area of the sphere, equals 4 pr2. Thus,\n2\n2\n0 044q qrrφε ε= × π =π(1.30)\nEquation (1.30) is a simple illustration of a general result of\nelectrostatics called Gauss’s law.\nWe state Gauss’s law  without pr oof:\nElectric flux through a closed surface S\n= q/ e0(1.31)\nq = total charge enclosed by S.\nThe law implies that the total electric flux through a closed surface is\nzero if no char ge is enclosed by the sur face. W e can see that explicitly in\nthe simple situation of Fig. 1.23.\nHere the electric field is uniform and we are considering a closed\ncylindrical surface, with its axis parallel to the uniform field E . The total\nflux f  through the surface is  f = f1 + f2 + f3, where f1 and f2 represent\nthe flux through the surfaces 1 and 2 (of circular cross-section) of the\ncylinder and f3 is the flux through the curved cylindrical part of the\nclosed surface. Now the normal to the surface 3 at every point is\nperpendicular to E, so by definition of flux,  f3 = 0. Further , the outwar d\nnormal to 2 is along E while the outward normal to 1 is opposite to E.\nTherefore,\nf1 = –E S1,     f2 = +E S2\nS1 = S2 = S\nwhere  S is the area of circular cross-section. Thus, the total flux is zero,\nas expected by Gauss’s law. Thus, whenever you find that the net electric\nflux through a closed surface is zero, we conclude that the total charge\ncontained in the closed surface is zero.\nThe great significance of Gauss’s law Eq. (1.31), is that it is true in\ngeneral, and not only for the simple cases we have considered above. Let\nus note some important points regarding this law:\n(i)Gauss’s law is true for any closed surface, no matter what its shape\nor size.\n(ii)The term q on the right side of Gauss’s law, Eq. (1.31), includes the\nsum of all charges enclosed by the surface. The charges may be located\nanywhere inside the surface.\n(iii)In the situation when the surface is so chosen that there are some\ncharges inside and some outside, the electric field [whose flux appears\non the left side of Eq. (1.31)] is due to all the charges, both inside and\noutside S. The ter m q on the right side of Gauss’s law, however ,\nrepresents only the total charge inside S.\nFIGURE  1.23  Calculation of the\nflux of uniform electric field\nthrough the sur face of a cylinder .\nReprint 2025-26\n\nElectric Charges\nand Fields\n31\n EXAMPLE  1.10(iv)The surface that we choose for the application of Gauss’s law is called\nthe Gaussian sur face. Y ou may choose any Gaussian sur face and\napply Gauss’s law. However , take car e not to let the Gaussian sur face\npass through any discrete charge. This is because electric field due\nto a system of discrete charges is not well defined at the location of\nany charge. (As you go close to the charge, the field grows without\nany bound.) However , the Gaussian sur face can pass thr ough a\ncontinuous charge distribution.\n(v)Gauss’s law is often useful towards a much easier calculation of the\nelectrostatic field when the system has some symmetry.  This is\nfacilitated by the choice of a suitable Gaussian surface.\n(vi) Finally, Gauss’s law is based on the inverse square dependence on\ndistance contained in the Coulomb’s law. Any violation of Gauss’s\nlaw will indicate departure from the inverse square law.\nExample 1.10  The electric field components in Fig. 1.24 are\nEx = ax1/2, Ey = Ez = 0, in which a = 800 N/C m1/2.

(1.27). In practice, except for some special cases, the\nsummation (or integration) involved in this equation cannot be carried\nout to give electric field at every point in\nspace. For some symmetric charge\nconfigurations, however , it is possible to\nobtain the electric field in a simple way using\nthe Gauss’s law. This is best understood by\nsome examples.\n1.14.1 Field due to an infinitely\nlong straight uniformly\ncharged wire\nConsider an infinitely long thin straight wire\nwith uniform linear charge density l. The wire\nis obviously an axis of symmetry. Suppose we\ntake the radial vector from O to P and rotate it\naround the wir e. The points P , P¢, P¢¢ so\nobtained are completely equivalent with\nrespect to the charged wire. This implies that\nthe electric field must have the same magnitude\nat these points. The direction of electric field at\nevery point must be radial (outward if l > 0,\ninward if l < 0). This is clear from Fig. 1.2 6.\nConsider a pair of line elements P1 and P2\nof the wire, as shown. The electric fields\nproduced by the two elements of the pair when\nsummed give a resultant electric field which\nis radial (the components normal to the radial\nvector cancel). This is true for any such pair\nand hence the total field at any point P is\nradial. Finally, since the wire is infinite,\nelectric field does not depend on the position\nof P along the length of the wire. In short, the\nelectric field is everywhere radial in the plane\ncutting the wire normally, and its magnitude\ndepends only on the radial distance r.\nTo calculate the field, imagine a cylindrical\nGaussian surface, as shown in the Fig. 1.2 6(b).\nSince the field is everywhere radial, flux\nthrough the two ends of the cylindrical\nGaussian surface is zero. At the cylindrical\npart of the surface, E is normal to the surface\nat every point, and its magnitude is constant,\nsince it depends only on r. The surface ar ea\nof the curved part is  2 prl, where l is the length\nof the cylinder .FIGURE 1.26 (a) Electric field due to an\ninfinitely long thin straight wire is radial,\n(b) The Gaussian surface for a long thin\nwire of uniform linear charge density.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n34Physics\nFlux through the Gaussian surface\n=flux through the curved cylindrical part of the surface\n=E × 2prl\nThe surface includes charge equal to l l. Gauss’s law then gives\nE × 2prl = ll/e0\ni.e.,E  = \n02rλ\nεπ\nVectorially, E at any point is given by\n0ˆ\n2rλ\nε=πE n (1.32)\nwhere ˆn is the radial unit vector in the plane normal to the wire passing\nthrough the point. E is directed outward if l is positive and inward if l is\nnegative.\nNote that when we write a vector A as a scalar multiplied by a unit\nvector , i.e., as A = A ˆa, the scalar A is  an algebraic number . It can be\nnegative or positive. The direction of A will be the same as that of the unit\nvector ˆaif A > 0 and opposite to ˆa if A < 0. When we want to restrict to\nnon-negative values, we use the symbol Aand call it the modulus of A.\nThus, 0≥A .\nAlso note that though only  the charge enclosed by the surface ( ll)\nwas included above, the electric field E is due to the charge on the entire\nwire. Further , the assumption that the wir e is infinitely long is crucial.\nWithout this assumption, we cannot take E to be normal to the curved\npart of the cylindrical Gaussian sur face. However , Eq. (1.32) is\napproximately true for electric field around the central portions of a long\nwire, where the end effects may be ignored.\n1.14.2  Field due to a uniformly charged infinite plane sheet\nLet s be the uniform surface charge density of an infinite plane sheet\n(Fig. 1.27). W e take the x-axis nor mal to the given plane. By symmetry,\nthe electric field will not depend on y and z coordinates and its direction\nat every point must be parallel to the x-direction.\nWe can take the Gaussian sur face to be a\nrectangular parallelepiped of cross-sectional area\nA, as shown. (A cylindrical surface will also do.) As\nseen from the figure, only the two faces 1 and 2 will\ncontribute to the flux; electric field lines are parallel\nto the other faces and they, therefore, do not\ncontribute to the total flux.\nThe unit vector normal to surface 1 is in – x\ndirection while  the unit  vector normal to surface 2\nis in the + x direction. Therefore, flux  E.DS through\nboth the surfaces are equal and add up. Therefore\nthe net flux through the Gaussian surface is 2 EA.\nThe charge enclosed by the closed surface is sA.\nTherefore by Gauss’s law,FIGURE  1.27  Gaussian surface for a\nuniformly charged infinite plane sheet.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nElectric Charges\nand Fields\n352 EA = sA/e0\nor,  E = s/2e0\nVectorically,\n0ˆ\n2σ\nε=E n (1.33)\nwhere ˆn is a unit vector normal to the plane and going away from it.\nE is directed away from the plate if s  is positive and toward the plate\nif s is negative. Note that the above application of the Gauss’ law has\nbrought out an additional fact: E is independent of x also.\nFor a finite large planar sheet, Eq. (1.33) is approximately true in the\nmiddle regions of the planar sheet, away from the ends.\n1.14.3   Field due to a uniformly charged thin spherical shell\nLet s be the uniform surface charge density of a thin spherical shell of\nradius R (Fig. 1.28). The situation has obvious spherical symmetry. The\nfield at any point P , outside or inside, can depend only on r (the radial\ndistance from the centre of the shell to the point) and must be radial (i.e.,\nalong the radius vector).\n(i)Field outside the shell:  Consider a point P outside the\nshell with radius vector r. To calculate E at P, we take the\nGaussian surface to be a sphere of radius r and with centre\nO, passing thr ough P . All points on this spher e are equivalent\nrelative to the given charged configuration. (That is what we\nmean by spherical symmetry.) The electric field at each point\nof the Gaussian surface, therefore, has the same magnitude\nE and is along the radius vector at each point. Thus, E and\nDS at every point are parallel and the flux through each\nelement is E DS. Summing over all DS, the flux through the\nGaussian surface is E × 4 p r2. The charge enclosed is\ns × 4 p R2. By Gauss’s law\nE × 4 p r2 = 2\n04Rσ\nεπ\nOr,  2\n2 2\n0 04R qEr rσ\nε ε= =π\nwhere q  =  4 p R2 s is the total charge on the spherical shell.\nVectorially,\n2\n0ˆ\n4q\nrε=πE r (1.34)\nThe electric field is directed outward if q > 0 and inward if\nq < 0. This, however , is exactly the field pr oduced by a char ge\nq placed at the centre O. Thus for points outside the shell, the field due\nto a uniformly charged shell is as if  the entire charge of the shell is\nconcentrated at its centre.\n(ii)Field inside the shell:  In Fig. 1.28(b), the point P is inside the\nshell. The Gaussian surface is again a sphere through P centred at O.FIGURE  1.28  Gaussian\nsurfaces for a point with\n(a) r > R, (b) r < R.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n36Physics\n EXAMPLE  1.12The flux through the Gaussian surface, calculated as before, is\nE × 4 p r2. However , in this case, the Gaussian sur face encloses no\ncharge. Gauss’s law then gives\nE × 4 p r2 =  0\ni.e., E = 0          ( r < R ) (1.35)\nthat is, the field due to a uniformly charged thin shell is zero at all points\ninside the shell *. This important result is a direct consequence of Gauss’s\nlaw which follows from Coulomb’s law. The experimental verification of\nthis result confirms the 1/ r2 dependence in Coulomb’s law.\nExample 1.12 An early model for an atom considered it to have a\npositively charged point nucleus of charge Ze, surrounded by a\nuniform density of negative charge up to a radius R. The atom as a\nwhole is neutral. For this model, what is the electric field at a distance\nr from the nucleus?\nFIGURE  1.29\nSolution   The charge distribution for this model of the atom is as\nshown in Fig. 1.29. The total negative charge in the uniform spherical\ncharge distribution of radius R must be – Z e, since the atom (nucleus\nof charge Z e + negative charge) is neutral. This immediately gives us\nthe negative char ge density r, since we must have\n340–3RZeρπ=\nor 33\n4Ze\nRρ=−π\nTo find the electric field E(r) at a point P which is a distance r away\nfrom the nucleus, we use Gauss’s law. Because of the spherical\nsymmetry of the charge distribution, the magnitude of the electric\nfield E(r) depends only on the radial distance, no matter what the\ndirection of r. Its dir ection is along (or opposite to) the radius vector r\nfrom the origin to the point P . The obvious Gaussian sur face is a\nspherical sur face centr ed at the nucleus. W e consider two situations,\nnamely, r < R and r > R.\n(i) r < R : The electric flux f enclosed by the spherical surface is\n    f  =  E (r) × 4 p r2\n*Compare this with a uniform mass shell discussed in Section 7.5 of Class XI\nTextbook of Physics.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nElectric Charges\nand Fields\n37\n EXAMPLE  1.12wher e E (r)  is the magnitude of the electric field at r. This is because\nthe field at any point on the spherical Gaussian surface has the\nsame direction as the normal to the surface there,  and has the same\nmagnitude at all points on the surface.\nThe charge q enclosed by the Gaussian surface is the positive nuclear\ncharge and the negative char ge within the spher e of radius r,\ni.e., 34\n3rq Z e ρπ= +\nSubstituting for the char ge density r  obtained earlier , we have\n3\n3rq Z e Z e\nR= −\nGauss’s law then gives,\n2 3\n01( ) ;4Z e rE r r Rr Rε  = − <     π\nThe electric field is directed radially outward.\n(ii) r > R:  In this case, the total charge enclosed by the Gaussian\nspherical surface is zero since the atom is neutral. Thus, from Gauss’s\nlaw,\nE (r) × 4 p  r2 = 0  or  E (r) = 0;    r > R\nAt r = R, both cases give the same result: E = 0.\nSUMMARY\n1.Electric and magnetic forces determine the properties of atoms,\nmolecules and bulk matter .\n2.From simple experiments on frictional electricity, one can infer that\nthere are two types of charges in nature; and that like charges repel\nand unlike charges attract. By convention, the charge on a glass rod\nrubbed with silk is positive; that on a plastic rod rubbed with fur is\nthen negative.\n3.Conductors allow movement of electric charge through them,\ninsulators do not. In metals, the mobile charges are electrons; in\nelectrolytes both positive and negative ions are mobile.\n4.Electric charge has three basic properties: quantisation, additivity\nand conservation.\nQuantisation of electric charge means that total charge ( q) of a body\nis always an integral multiple of a basic quantum of charge ( e) i.e.,\nq = n e, where n = 0, ±1, ±2, ±3, .... Proton and electron have charges\n+e, –e, respectively. For macroscopic charges for which n is a very large\nnumber , quantisation of char ge can be ignor ed.\nAdditivity of electric charges means that the total charge of a system\nis the algebraic sum (i.e., the sum taking into account proper signs)\nof all individual charges in the system.\nConservation of electric charges means that the total charge of an\nisolated system remains unchanged with time. This means that when\nReprint 2025-26\n\n38Physics\nbodies are charged through friction, there is a transfer of electric charge\nfrom one body to another , but no cr eation or destruction\nof charge.\n5.Coulomb’s Law : The mutual electrostatic force between two point\ncharges q1 and q2 is proportional to the product q1q2 and inversely\nproportional to the square of the distance r21 separating them.\nMathematically,\nF21 = force on q2 due to  1 2\n1 21 2\n21ˆk (q q )qr= r\nwhere 21ˆr is a unit vector in the direction from q1 to q2 and k =  \n01\n4επ\nis the constant of proportionality.\nIn SI units, the unit of charge is coulomb. The experimental value of\nthe constant e0 is\ne0 = 8.854 × 10–12 C2 N–1 m–2\nThe approximate value of k is\nk = 9 × 109 N m2 C–2\n6.The ratio of electric force and gravitational force between a proton\nand an electron is\n2\n392 4 10\ne pk e.G m m≅ ×\n7.Superposition Principle : The principle is based on the property that the\nforces with which two charges attract or repel each other are not\naffected by the presence of a third (or more) additional charge(s). For\nan assembly of charges q1, q2, q3, ..., the force on any charge, say q1, is\nthe vector sum of the force on  q1 due to q2, the force on  q1 due to q3,\nand so on. For each pair , the for ce is given by the Coulomb’s law for\ntwo char ges stated earlier .\n8.The electric field E at a point due to a charge configuration is the\nforce on a small positive test charge q placed at the point divided by\nthe magnitude of the charge. Electric field due to a point charge q has\na magnitude | q|/4pe0r2; it is radially outwards from q, if q is positive,\nand radially inwards if q is negative. Like Coulomb force, electric field\nalso satisfies superposition principle.\n9.An electric field line is a curve drawn in such a way that the tangent\nat each point on the curve gives the direction of electric field at that\npoint. The relative closeness of field lines indicates the relative strength\nof electric field at different points; they crowd near each other in regions\nof strong electric field and are far apart where the electric field is\nweak. In regions of constant electric field, the field lines are uniformly\nspaced parallel straight lines.\n10.Some of the important properties of field lines are: (i) Field lines are\ncontinuous curves without any breaks. (ii) Two field lines cannot cross\neach other . (iii) Electr ostatic field lines start at positive char ges and\nend at negative charges —they cannot form closed loops.\n11.An electric dipole is a pair of equal and opposite charges q and – q\nseparated by some distance 2 a.

The law is especially useful\nin determining electric field E , when the source distribution has simple\nsymmetry:\n(i) Thin infinitely long straight wire of uniform linear charge density l\n0ˆ\n2 rλ\nε=πE n\nwhere r is the perpendicular distance of the point from the wire and\nˆnis the radial unit vector in the plane normal to the wire passing\nthrough the point.\n(ii) Infinite thin plane sheet of uniform surface charge density s\n0ˆ\n2σ\nε=E n\nwhere ˆn is a unit vector normal to the plane, outward on either side.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n40Physics\n(iii) Thin spherical shell of uniform surface charge density s\n2\n0ˆ ( )4qr Rrε= ≥πE r\nE = 0      (r   <   R)\nwhere r is the distance of the point from the centre of the shell and R\nthe radius of the shell. q is the total charge of the shell:  q = 4 pR2s.\nThe electric field outside the shell is as though the total charge is\nconcentrated at the centre.

Why do they not fly away?\nYou will lear n that ther e is a thir d kind of a fundamental for ce,\ncalled the str ong for ce which holds them together . The range of\ndistance wher e this for ce is ef fective is, however , very small ~10-14\nm. This is precisely the size of the nucleus. Also the electrons are\nnot allowed to sit on top of the protons, i.e. inside the nucleus,\ndue to the laws of quantum mechanics. This gives the atoms their\nstructure as they exist in na ture.\n2.Coulomb force and gravitational force follow the same inverse-square\nlaw. But gravitational force has only one sign (always attractive), while\nReprint 2025-26\n\nElectric Charges\nand Fields\n41Coulomb force can be of both signs (attractive and repulsive), allowing\npossibility of cancellation of electric forces. This is how gravity, despite\nbeing a much weaker force, can be a dominating and more pervasive\nforce in nature.\n3.The constant of proportionality k in Coulomb’s law is a matter of\nchoice if the unit of charge is to be defined using Coulomb’s law. In SI\nunits, however , what is defined is the unit of curr ent (A) via its magnetic\neffect (Ampere’s law) and the unit of charge (coulomb) is simply defined\nby (1C = 1 A s). In this case, the value of k is no longer arbitrary; it is\napproximately 9 × 109 N m2 C–2.\n4.The rather large value of k, i.e., the large size of the unit of charge\n(1C) from the point of view of electric effects arises because (as\nmentioned in point 3 already) the unit of charge is defined in terms of\nmagnetic forces (forces on  current–carrying wires) which are generally\nmuch weaker than the electric forces. Thus while 1 ampere is a unit\nof reasonable size for magnetic effects, 1 C = 1 A s, is too big a unit for\nelectric effects.\n5.The additive property of charge is not an ‘obvious’ property. It is related\nto the fact that electric charge has no direction associated with it;\ncharge is a scalar .\n6.Charge is not only a scalar (or invariant) under rotation; it is also\ninvariant for frames of reference in relative motion. This is not always\ntrue for every scalar . For example, kinetic ener gy is a scalar under\nrotation, but is not invariant for frames of reference in relative\nmotion.\n7.Conservation of total charge of an isolated system is a property\nindependent of the scalar nature of charge noted in point 6.\nConservation refers to invariance in time in a given frame of reference.\nA quantity may be scalar but not conserved (like kinetic energy in an\ninelastic collision). On the other hand, one can have conserved vector\nquantity (e.g., angular momentum of an isolated system).\n8.Quantisation of electric charge is a basic (unexplained) law of nature;\ninterestingly, there is no analogous law on quantisation of mass.\n9.Superposition principle should not be regarded as ‘obvious’, or\nequated with the law of addition of vectors. It says two things:\nforce on one charge due to another charge is unaffected by the\npresence of other charges, and there are no additional three-body,\nfour-body, etc., for ces which arise only when ther e are mor e than\ntwo charges.\n10.The electric field due to a discrete charge configuration is not defined\nat the locations of the discrete charges. For continuous volume\ncharge distribution, it is defined at any point in the distribution.\nFor a surface charge distribution, electric field is discontinuous\nacross the surfac e.\n11.The electric field due to a charge configuration with total charge zero\nis not zero; but for distances large compared to the size of\nthe configuration, its field falls off faster than 1/ r2, typical of field\ndue to a single charge. An electric dipole is the simplest example of\nthis fa ct.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n42Physics\nEXERCISES\n1.1 What is the force between  two small charged spheres having\ncharges of 2 × 10–7C and 3 × 10–7C placed 30 cm apart in air?\n1.2 The electrostatic force on a small sphere of charge 0.4 mC due to\nanother small sphere of charge –0.8 mC in air is 0.2 N.
