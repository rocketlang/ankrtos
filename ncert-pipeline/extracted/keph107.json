      "title": "Law of areas :  The line that joins any planet",
      "content": "2. Law of areas :  The line that joins any planet\nto the sun sweeps  equal areas in equal\nintervals of time (Fig. 7.2).  This law comes from\nthe observations that planets appear to move\nslower when they are  farther from the sun\nthan when they ar e near er.\nFig. 7.2 The planet P moves around the sun in an\nelliptical orbit. The shaded area is the area\n∆A swept out in a small interval of time  ∆t.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nGRAVITATION 129\n⊳3. Law of periods :  The square of the time period\nof revolution of a planet is proportional to the\ncube of the semi-major axis of the ellipse traced\nout by  the planet.\nTable 7.1 gives the approximate time periods\nof revolution of eight * planets around the sun\nalong with values of their semi-major axes.\nTable 7.1 Data from measurement of\nplanetary motions given below\nconfirm Kepler’s Law of Periods\n(a≡Semi-major  axis in units of  1010 m.\nT≡Time period of revolution of the planet\nin years(y).\nQ≡The quotient ( T2/a3  ) in units of\n10 -34 y2 m-3.)\nPlanet a T Q\nMercury 5.79 0.24 2.95\nVenus 10.8 0.615 3.00\nEarth 15.0 1 2.96\nMars 22.8 1.88 2.98\nJupiter 77.8\n11.9 3.01\nSaturn 143 29.5 2.98\nUranus 287 84 2.98\nNeptune 450 165 2.99\nThe law of areas can be understood as a\nconsequence of  conservation of angular\nmomentum whch is valid for any central\nforce . A central force is such that  the force\non the planet is along the vector joining the\nSun and the planet. Let the Sun be at the\norigin and let the position and momentum\nof the planet be denoted by r and p\nrespectively. Then the area swept out by the\nplanet of mass m in time interval ∆t is (Fig.\n7.2) ∆A given by\nΔA = ½  (r × v∆t) (7.1)\n Hence\nΔA/∆t   =½ (r × p)/m, (since  v = p/m)\n                       =    L / (2 m) (7.2)\nwhere v is the velocity,  L is the angular\nmomentum equal  to   ( r  ×  p).  For a central\nforce, which is dir ected along r, L is  a consta nt\nas the planet goes around. Hence,  ΔA/∆t is a\nconstant according to the last equation. This isthe law of areas. Gravitation is a central force\nand hence the law of areas follows.\nExample 7.1   Let  the speed of the planet\nat  the  perihelion P in Fig. 7.1(a) be vP  and\nthe Sun-planet distance SP be rP. Relate\n{rP, vP} to the corr esponding quantities at\nthe aphelion { rA, vA}. Will the planet take\nequal times to traverse BAC and CPB ?\nAnswer   The magnitude of the angular\nmomentum at P is Lp =  m p rp vp, since inspection\ntells us that rp and vp are mutually\nperpendicular . Similarly, LA = m p rA vA. From\nangular momentum conservation\nmp rp vp = m p rA vA\norv\nvp\nA=r\nrA\np⊳\nSince rA   > rp, vp > vA .\nThe ar ea SBAC bounded by the ellipse and\nthe radius vectors SB and SC is larger than SBPC\nin Fig. 7.1. From Kepler’s second law, equal areas\nare swept in equal times. Hence the planet will\ntake a longer time to traverse BAC than CPB.\n7.3  UNIVERSAL LAW OF GRAVITATION\nLegend has it that observing an apple falling from\na tree, Newton was inspired to arrive at an\nuniversal law of gravitation that led to an\nexplanation of terr estrial  gravitation as well as\nof Kepler’s laws.  Newton’s r easoning was that\nthe moon r evolving in an orbit of radius Rm was\nsubject to a centripetal acceleration due to\nearth’s gravity of magnitude\n2 2\n24m\nm\nmR VaR Tπ= = (7.3)\nwhere V is the speed of the moon related to the\ntime period T  by the relation 2 /m V R Tπ= . The\ntime period T is about 27.3 days and Rm was\nalready known then to be about 3.84 × 108m.  If\nwe substitute these numbers in Eq. (7.3), we get\na value of am much smaller than the value of\nacceleration due to gravity g on the surface of\nthe earth, arising also due to earth’s gravitational\nattraction.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n130 PHYSICS\n⊳This clearly shows that the force due to\nearth’s gravity decreases with distance.  If one\nassumes that the gravitational force due to the\nearth decreases in proportion to the inverse\nsquare of the distance from the centre of the\nearth, we will have am α2\nmR−; g α 2\nER− and we get\n2\n2m\nm ERg\na R=  3600 (7.4)\nin agreement with a value of g  9.8  m s-2 and\nthe value of am from Eq. (7.3).  These observations\nled Newton to propose the following Universal Law\nof Gravitation :\nEvery body in the universe attracts every other\nbody with a for ce which is dir ectly pr oportional\nto the pr oduct of their masses and inversely\nproportional to the squar e of the distance\nbetween them.\nThe quotation is essentially fr om Newton’s\nfamous tr eatise  called ‘Mathematical Principles\nof Natural Philosophy’ (Principia for short).\nStated Mathematically, Newton’s gravitation\nlaw reads : The for ce F on a point mass m2 due\nto another point mass m1 has the magnitude\n1 2\n2| |m mGr=F (7.5)\nEquation  (7.5) can be expressed in vector form as\nɵ()ɵ 1 2 1 2\n2 2– –m m m mG Gr r= = F r r\n   ɵ 1 2\n3–m mG= r\nr\nwhere G is the universal gravitational constant,\nɵr is the unit vector fr om m1 to m2 and r = r2 – r1\nas shown in Fig. 7.3.The  gravitational force is attractive, i.e., the\nforce F is along – r. The for ce on point mass m1\ndue to m2 is of course \n– F by Newton’s third law.\nThus, the gravitational force F12 on the body 1\ndue to 2 and F21 on the body 2 due to 1 are related\nas F12 = – F21.\nBefore we can apply Eq. (7.5) to objects under\nconsideration, we have to be careful since the\nlaw refers to point  masses whereas we deal with\nextended objects which have finite size. If we have\na collection of point masses, the force on any\none of them is the vector sum of the gravitational\nforces exerted by the other point masses as\nshown in Fig 7.4.\nFig. 7.4 Gravitational force on point mass m1 is the\nvector sum of the gravitational for ces exerted\nby m2, m3 and m4.\nThe total for ce on m1 is\n2 1\n1 2\n21Gm m\nr=Fɵ 3 1212\n31Gm m\nr+r ɵɵ 4 131 412\n41Gm m\nr+r r\nExample 7.2   Three equal masses of m kg\neach ar e fixed at the vertices of an\nequilateral triangle ABC.\n(a) What is the force acting on a mass 2 m\nplaced at the centr oid G of the triangl e?\n(b) What is the for ce if the mass at the\nvertex A is doubled ?\n      Take AG = BG = CG = 1 m (see Fig. 7.5)\nAnswer   (a) The angle between GC and the\npositive x-axis is 30° and so is the angle between\nGB and the negative x-axis. The individual forces\nin vector notation areFig. 7.3 Gravitational force on m1 due to m2 is along\nr wher e the vector r is (r2– r1).O\nReprint 2025-26\n\nGRAVIT ATION 131\ncases, a  simple law results when you do that :\n(1)The force of attraction between a hollow\nspherical shell of uniform density and a\npoint mass situated outside is just as if\nthe entire mass of the shell is\nconcentrated at the centre of the shell.\nQualitatively this can be understood as\nfollows: Gravitational forces caused by the\nvarious regions of the shell have components\nalong the line joining the point mass to the\ncentre as well as along a direction\nprependicular to this line. The components\nprependicular to this line cancel out when\nsumming over all regions of the shell leaving\nonly a resultant force along the line joining\nthe point to the centre. The magnitude of\nthis force works out to be as stated above.\n(2)The force of attraction due to a hollow\nspherical shell of uniform density, on a\npoint mass situated inside it is zero.\nQualitatively, we can again understand this\nresult. V arious r egions of the spherical shell\nattract the point mass inside it in various\ndirections. These forces cancel each other\ncompletely.\n7.4  THE GRAVITATIONAL CONSTANT\nThe value of the gravitational constant G entering\nthe Universal law of gravitation  can be\ndetermined experimentally and this was first done\nby English scientist Henry Cavendish in 1798.\nThe apparatus used by him is schematically\nshown in Fig.7.6\nFig. 7.6 Schematic drawing of Cavendish’s\nexperiment. S1 and S2 are large spheres\nwhich are kept on either side (shown\nshades) of the masses at A and B. When\nthe big spheres are taken to the other side\nof the masses (shown by dotted circles),\nthe bar AB rotates a little since the torque\nreverses direction. The angle of rotation can\nbe measured experimentally.Fig. 7.5 Three equal masses are placed at the three\nvertices of the ∆ ABC. A mass 2m is placed\nat the centroid G .\n()\nGA2ˆ\n1Gm m=F j\n()( ) GB2ˆ ˆcos 30 sin 301Gm mο ο= − − F  i j \n()( ) GC2ˆ ˆcos 30 sin 301Gm mο ο= + − F  i j \nFrom the principle of superposition and the law\nof vector addition, the resultant gravitational\nforce FR on (2 m) is\n FR  =  FGA + FGB + FGC\n ( )ο ο− − + = 30  sinˆ30  cosˆ2   ˆ2    2 2\nR  j  i j  F Gm Gm\n              ( )0 30  sinˆ30  cosˆ2  2= − +ο ο j  i  Gm\nAlternatively, one expects on the basis of\nsymmetry that the resultant force ought to be\nzero.\n(b) Now if the mass at vertex A is doubled\nthen\n⊳\nFor the gravitational force between an exte nded\nobject (like the earth) and a point mass, Eq. (7.5) is not\ndirectly applicable. Each point mass in the extended\nobject will exert a force on the given point mass and\nthese for ce will not all be in the same dir ection. W e\nhave to add up these forces vectorially  for all the point\nmasses in the extended object to get the total force.\nThis is easily done using calculus. For two special\nReprint 2025-26\n\n132 PHYSICS\nMrThe bar AB has two small lead spheres\nattached at its ends.  The bar is suspended from\na rigid support by a fine wire.  Two large lead\nspheres are brought close to the small ones but\non opposite sides as shown.  The big spheres\nattract the nearby small ones by equal and\nopposite force as shown.  There is no net force\non the bar but only a torque which is clearly\nequal to F times the length of the bar ,wher e F is\nthe force of attraction between a big sphere and\nits neighbouring small sphere.  Due to this\ntorque, the suspended wire  gets twisted till such\ntime as the restoring torque of the wire equals\nthe gravitational torque .  If θ is the angle of twist\nof the suspended wire, the restoring torque is\nproportional to θ, equal to τθ. Where τ is the\nrestoring couple per unit angle of twist. τ can be\nmeasured independently e.g. by applying a\nknown torque and measuring the angle of twist.\nThe gravitational for ce between the spherical\nballs is the same as if their masses ar e\nconcentrated at their centr es.  Thus if d is the\nseparation between the centr es of the big and\nits neighbouring small ball, M and m their\nmasses, the gravitational for ce between the big\nsphere and its neighouring small ball is.\n2MmF Gd= (7.6)\nIf   L  is the length of  the bar AB , then the\ntorque arising out of F  is  F  multiplied by L. At\nequilibrium, this is equal to the restoring torque\nand hence\n2MmG Ldτ θ= (7.7)\nObservation of θ thus enables one to\ncalculate G from this equation.\nSince Cavendish’s  experiment, the\nmeasur ement of G has been r efined and the\ncurrently accepted value is\nG = 6.67×10-11  N m2/kg2(7.8)\n7.5ACCELERA TION DUE TO GRA VITY OF\nTHE EARTH\nThe earth can be imagined to be a sphere made\nof a large number of concentric spherical shells\nwith the smallest one at the centre and the\nlargest one at its sur face.  A point outside the\nearth  is obviously outside all the shells.  Thus,all the shells exert a gravitational force at the\npoint outside just as if their masses are\nconcentrated at their common centre according\nto the result stated in section 7.3. The total mass\nof all the shells combined is just the mass of the\nearth.  Hence, at a point outside the earth, the\ngravitational force is just as if its entire mass of\nthe earth is concentrated at its centre.\nFor a point inside the earth, the situation\nis different.  This is illustrated in Fig. 7.7.\nFig. 7.7 The mass m is in a mine located at a depth\nd below the sur face of the Earth of mass\nME and radius R E. We treat the Earth to be\nspherically symmetric.\nAgain consider the earth  to be made up of\nconcentric shells as befor e and a point mass m\nsituated at a distance r from the centr e.  The\npoint  P lies outside the spher e of radius r.  For\nthe shells of radius gr eater than r , the point P\nlies inside.  Hence accor ding to result stated in\nthe last section, they exert no gravitational for ce\non mass m  kept at P .  The shells with radius ≤r\nmake up a spher e of radius r for which the point\nP lies on the sur face.  This smaller spher e\ntherefore exerts a for ce on a mass m at P as if\nits mass Mr is concentrated at the centre.  Thus\nthe force on the mass m at P has a magnitude\nr\n2( )Gm MF\nr= (7.9)\nWe assume that the entir e earth is of unifor m\ndensity and hence its mass is 3\nE4\n3E M Rπρ =\nwhere ME is the mass of the earth RE is its radius\nand ρ is the density.  On the other hand the\nmass of the sphere Mr of radius r is 3 4\n3rπρ and\nReprint 2025-26\n\nGRAVIT ATION 133\nhence\nE\n3\nEG m MrR=(7.10)\nIf the mass m is situated on the surface of\nearth, then  r = RE and the gravitational for ce on\nit is, from Eq. (7.10)\n2E\nEM mF GR=(7.11)\nThe acceleration experienced by the mass\nm, which is usually denoted by the symbol g is\nrelated to F by Newton’s 2nd law by relation\nF = mg. Thus\n2E\nEGMFgm R= = (7.12)\nAcceleration g  is readily measurable.  RE is a\nknown quantity.  The measur ement of G by\nCavendish’s experiment (or otherwise), combined\nwith knowledge of g and RE enables one to\nestimate \nME from Eq. (7.12).  This is the reason\nwhy ther e is a popular statement r egarding\nCavendish : “Cavendish weighed the earth”.\n7.6ACCELERA TION DUE TO GRA VITY BELOW\nAND ABOVE THE SURF ACE OF EAR TH\nConsider a point mass m at a height h above the\nsurface of the earth as shown in Fig. 7.8(a).  The\nradius of the earth is denoted by  RE . Since this\npoint is outside the earth,\nFig. 7.8 (a)g at a height h above the surface of the\nearth.its distance from the centre of the earth is\n(RE +  h ).  If   F (h) denoted the magnitude of\nthe  force on the point mass m , we get from\nEq. (7.5) :\n2( )( )E\nEGM mF hR h=+(7.13)\nThe acceleration experienced by the point\nmass is ( )/ ( )F h m g h ≡ and we get\n2( )( ) .\n( )E\nEGM F hg hm R h= =\n+(7.14)\nThis is clearly less than the value of g on the\nsurface of earth : 2.E\nEGMg\nR= For ,E h R<< we can\nexpand the RHS of Eq.

(7.15)\nEquation (7.15) thus tells us that for small\nheights h above the value of g decr eases by a\nfactor (1 2 / ).E h R−\nNow, consider a point mass m at a depth\nd below the surface of the earth (Fig. 7.8(b)),\nso that its distance from the centre of the\nearth is ( )ER d− as shown in the figure.   The\nearth can be thought of as being composed\nof a smaller sphere of radius  ( RE  – d )  and a\nspherical shell of thickness d.  The force on\nm due to the outer shell of thickness  d is\nzero because the result quoted in the\nprevious section. As far as the smaller\nsphere of radius  ( RE  – d  ) is concerned, the\npoint mass is outside it and hence according\nto the r esult quoted earlier , the for ce due to\nthis smaller sphere is just as if the entire\nmass of the smaller sphere is concentrated\nat the centre. If Ms  is the mass of the smaller\nsphere, then,\nMs/ME = ( RE – d)3  / RE3( 7.16)\nSince  mass of a sphere is proportional to be\ncube of its radius.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n134 PHYSICS\nFig. 7.8 (b)g at a depth d. In this case only the smaller\nsphere of radius (RE–d) contributes to g.\nThus the force on the point mass is\nF (d)  =   G  Ms  m  /  (RE  – d ) 2(7.17)\nSubstituting for  Ms  from above , we get\nF (d)   =  G  ME m ( RE – d ) /  RE 3(7.18)\nand hence the acceleration due to gravity at\na depth d,\ng(d) = ( )F d\nmis\n3( )( ) ( )E\nE\nEGM F dg d R dm R= = −\n(1 / )E\nE\nER dg g d RR−== −(7.19)\nThus, as we go down below earth’s surface,\nthe acceleration due gravity decr eases by a factor\n(1 / ).E d R− The r emarkable thing about\nacceleration due to earth’s gravity is that it is\nmaximum on its sur face decr easing whether you\ngo up or down.\n7.7  GRAVITATIONAL POTENTIAL ENERGY\nWe had discussed earlier the notion of potential\nenergy as being the ener gy stor ed in the body at\nits given position.  If the position of the particle\nchanges on account of for ces acting on it, then\nthe change in its potential energy is just the\namount of work done on the body by the force.\nAs we had discussed earlier , forces for which the\nwork done is independent of the path are the\nconservative forces.\nThe force of gravity is a conservative for ce\nand we can calculate the potential ener gy of a\nbody arising out of this force, called the\ngravitational potential energy. Consider pointsclose to the surface of earth, at distances from\nthe surface much smaller than the radius of the\nearth.  In such cases, the for ce of gravity is\npractically a constant equal to mg, directed\ntowards the centre of the earth.  If we consider a\npoint at a height h1 from the surface of the earth\nand another point vertically above it at a height\nh2 from the surface, the work done in lifting the\nparticle of mass m from the first to the second\nposition is denoted by W12\nW12 = Force × displacement\n      = mg\n (h2 – h1) (7.20)\nIf we associate a potential energy W(h) at a\npoint at a height h above the surface such that\nW(h) = mgh  + Wo(7.21)\n(wher e Wo = constant) ;\nthen it is clear that\nW12 = W(h2)  – W(h1) (7.22)\nThe work done in moving the particle is just\nthe dif ference of potential ener gy between its\nfinal and initial positions.Observe that the\nconstant Wo cancels out in Eq. (7.22).  Setting  h\n= 0 in the last equation, we get   W ( h = 0 ) =  Wo.\n.  h = 0 means points on the surface of the earth.\nThus,  Wo  is the  potential ener gy on the sur face\nof the earth.\nIf we consider points at arbitrary distance\nfrom the sur face of the earth, the r esult just\nderived is not valid since the assumption that\nthe gravitational force mg is a constant is no\nlonger valid.  However , from our discussion we\nknow that a point outside the earth, the for ce of\ngravitation on a particle dir ected towar ds the\ncentre of the earth is\n2EG M mF\nr= (7.23)\nwhere ME = mass of earth, m  = mass of the\nparticle and r its distance fr om the centr e of the\nearth.  If we now calculate the work done in\nlifting a particle fr om r = r1 to r = r2 (r2 > r1) along\na vertical path, we get instead of Eq. (7.20)\nWG M m\nrr\nrr\n12 212=∫d\n=− −\n\nG M mr rE1 1\n2 1(7.24)\nIn place of Eq. (7.21), we can thus associate\na potential ener gy W(r) at a distance r, such thatMs ME\nReprint 2025-26\n\nGRAVIT ATION 135\n⊳E\n1 ( ) ,G M mW r Wr=− + (7.25)\nvalid for r  > R ,\nso that once again W12 = W(r2) – W(r1).\nSetting   r = infinity in the last equation, we get\nW ( r = infinity ) =   W1 .   Thus,  W1  is the potential\nenergy at infinity. One should note that only the\ndifference of potential energy between two points\nhas a definite meaning  from Eqs. (7.22) and\n(7.24). One conventionally sets  W1 equal to zero,\nso that the potential energy at a point is just the\namount of work done in displacing the particle\nfrom infinity to that point.\nWe have  calculated the potential ener gy at\na point of a particle  due to gravitational forces\non it due to the earth and it is proportional to\nthe mass of the particle. The gravitational\npotential due to the gravitational for ce of the\nearth is defined as the potential ener gy of  a\nparticle of unit mass at that point. Fr om the\nearlier discussion, we lear n that the gravitational\npotential energy associated with two particles\nof masses m1 and m2 separated by distance by a\ndistance r is given by\n1 2–Gm mVr=  (if we choose V = 0 as r →∞)\nIt should be noted that an isolated system of\nparticles will have the total potential energy that\nequals the sum of energies (given by the above\nequation) for all possible pairs of its constituent\nparticles. This is an example of the application\nof the superposition principle.\nExample 7.3  Find the potential energy of\na system of four particles placed at the\nvertices of a square of side l. Also obtain\nthe potential at the centr e of the squar e.\nAnswer    Consider four masses each of mass m\nat the corners of a square of side l; See Fig. 7.9.\nWe have four mass pairs at distance l and two\ndiagonal pairs at distance 2l\nHence,\n2 2G  ( )   4   2 \n2 m G mW rl l= − −\nlm G\nlm G2 2  5.41    \n21  2    2  − =\n\n\n+ − =The gravitational potential at the centre of\nthe square  ()2 2=r  l/  is\nG m( )   4 2 = − U rl. ⊳\n7.8  ESCAPE SPEED\nIf a stone is thr own by hand, we see it falls back\nto the earth. Of course using machines we can\nshoot an object with much gr eater speeds and\nwith gr eater and gr eater initial speed, the object\nscales higher and higher heights. A natural\nquery that arises in our mind is the following:\n‘can we throw an object with such high initial\nspeeds that it does not fall back to the earth?’\nThe principle of conservation of ener gy helps\nus to answer this question. Suppose the object\ndid reach infinity and that its speed ther e was\nVf. The energy of an object is the sum of potential\nand kinetic energy. As before W1 denotes that\ngravitational potential ener gy of the object at\ninfinity.

Their motion is very similar to the\nmotion of planets around the Sun and hence\nKepler’s laws of planetary motion are equally\napplicable to them.  In particular , their orbits\naround the earth are circular or elliptic.  Moon is\nthe only natural satellite of the earth with a near\ncircular orbit with a time period of approximately\n27.3 days which is also roughly equal to the\nrotational period of the moon about its own axis.\nSince, 1957, advances in technology have enabled\nmany countries including India to launch artificial\nearth satellites for practical use in fields like\ntelecommunication, geophysics and meteorology.\nWe will consider a satellite in a cir cular orbit\nof a distance ( RE + h) from the centr e of the earth,\nwher e RE = radius of the earth. If \nm is the mass\nof the satellite and V  its speed, the centripetal\nforce r equired for this orbit is\nF(centripetal) = 2\n( )EmV\nR h+(7.33)\ndirected towards the centre.  This centripetal force\nis provided by the gravitational for ce, which is\nF(gravitation) = 2( )E\nEG m M\nR h+(7.34)\nwhere ME is the mass of the earth.\nEquating R.H.S of Eqs. (7.33) and (7.34) and\ncancelling out m, we get\n2\n( )E\nEG MVR h=+(7.35)\nThus V decreases as h increases.  From\nequation (7.35),the speed V  for  h = 0  is\n2( 0) /E E V h GM R gR= = = (7.36)\nwhere we have used the relation\ng =2/E GM R . In every orbit, the satellitetraverses a distance 2π (RE + h) with speed V.  Its\ntime period T therefore is\n3 /22 ( ) 2 ( )E E\nER h R hTV G Mπ π+ += =(7.37)\non substitution of value of V from Eq.

For a\nsatellite very close to the sur face of earth h can\nbe neglected in comparison to RE in Eq.

Let F1, F2, ….Fn be the individual\nforces due to M1, M2, ….Mn, each  given by the law of gravitation.

The gravitational potential energy associated with two particles separated by a distance\nr is given by\nrm m GV2 1     − =\nwhere V is taken to be zero at r → ∞. The total potential energy for a system of particles is the\nsum of energies for all pairs of particles, with each pair represented by a term of the form given\nby above equation.

However , it is not special\nto the inverse square law of gravitation. It holds for any central force.\n3.In Kepler’s third law (see Eq. (7.1) and  T2 = KS R3. The constant KS is the same for all\nplanets in circular orbits. This applies to satellites orbiting the Earth [(Eq. (7.38)].\n4.An astronaut experiences weightlessness in a space satellite. This is not because the\ngravitational for ce is small at that location in space. It is because both the astr onaut\nand the satellite ar e in “fr ee fall” towar ds the Earth.\n5.The gravitational potential ener gy associated with two particles separated by a distance\nr is given by\nVG m m\nr= +–1 2constant\nThe constant can be given any value. The simplest choice is to take it to be zero. With\nthis choice\nVG m m\nr=–1 2\nThis choice implies that V →  0 as r →  ∞.  Choosing location of zer o of the gravitational\nenergy is the same as choosing the arbitrary constant in the potential energy. Note that\nthe gravitational force is not altered by the choice of this constant.\n6.The total mechanical energy of an object is the sum of its kinetic energy (which is always\npositive) and the potential energy. Relative to infinity (i.e. if we presume that the potential\nenergy of the object at infinity is zero), the gravitational potential energy of an object is\nnegative. The total energy of a satellite is negative.\n7.The commonly encountered expression m gh for the potential energy is actually an\napproximation to the difference in the gravitational potential energy discussed in the\npoint 6, above.\n8.Although the gravitational force between two particles is central, the force between two\nfinite rigid bodies is not necessarily along the line joining their centre of mass. For a\nspherically symmetric body however the force on a particle external to the body is as if\nthe mass is concentrated at the centre and this force is therefore central.\n9.The gravitational for ce on a particle inside a spherical shell is zer o.
