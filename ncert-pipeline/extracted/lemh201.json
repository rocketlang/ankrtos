Leibnitz\n(1646-1716)\nReprint 2025-26\n\n226 MATHEMA TICS\nThere is a connection, known as the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus , between\nindefinite integral and definite integral which makes the definite integral as a practical\ntool for science and engineering. The definite integral is also used to solve many interesting\nproblems from various disciplines like economic s, finance and probability .\nIn this Chapter , we shall confine ourselves to the study of indefinite and definite\nintegrals and their elementary properties including some techniques of integration.\n7.2  Integration as an Inverse Process of Differentiation\nIntegration is the inverse process of differentiation. Instead of differentiating a function,\nwe are given the derivative of a function and asked to find its primitive, i.e., the original\nfunction. Such a process is called integration  or anti differ entiation .\nLet us consider the following examples:\nWe know that (sin )dxdx =cos x ... (1)\n3\n( )3d x\ndx =x2... (2)\nand ( )xdedx=ex... (3)\nWe observe that in (1), the function cos x is the derived function of sin x. We say\nthat sin x is an anti derivative (or an integral) of cos x. Similarly , in (2) and (3), 3\n3x and\nex are the anti derivatives (or integrals) of x2 and ex, respectively . Again, we note that\nfor any real number C, treated as constant function, its derivative is zero and hence, we\ncan write (1), (2) and (3) as follows :\n(sin + C) cos =dx xdx, 3\n2( + C)3=d xxdxand ( + C) =x x de edx\nThus, anti derivatives (or integrals) of the above cited functions are not unique.\nActually , there exist infinitely many anti derivatives of each of these functions which\ncan be obtained by choosing C arbitrarily from the set of real numbers. For this reason\nC is customarily referred to as arbitrary constant . In fact, C is the parameter  by\nvarying which one gets different anti derivatives (or integrals) of the given function.\nMore generally , if there is a function F such that F ( ) = ( )dx f xdx, ∀x ∈ I (interval),\nthen for any arbitrary real number C, (also called constant of integration )\n[ ]F ( ) + Cdxdx =f(x), x ∈ I\nReprint 2025-26\n\nINTEGRALS         227\nThus, {F + C, C ∈ R} denotes a family of anti derivatives of f.\nRemark   Functions with same derivatives dif fer by a constant. To show this, let g and h\nbe two functions having the same derivatives on an interval I.\nConsider the function f = g – h defined by f(x) = g(x) – h(x), ∀x ∈ I\nThendf\ndx=f′ = g′  – h′ giving  f′ (x) = g′ (x) – h′ (x) ∀x ∈ I\nor f′ (x) =0, ∀x ∈ I by hypothesis,\ni.e., the rate of change of f with respect to x is zero on I and hence f is constant.\nIn view of the above remark, it is justified to infer that the family {F + C, C ∈ R}\nprovides all possible anti derivatives of f.\nWe introduce a new symbol, namely , ( )f x dx∫  which will represent the entire\nclass of anti derivatives read as the indefinite integral of f with respect to x.\nSymbolically , we write ( ) = F ( ) + Cf x dx x∫.\nNotation  Given that  ( )dyf xdx= , we write y = ( )f x dx∫ .\nFor the sake of convenience, we mention below the following symbols/terms/phrases\nwith their meanings as given in the Table (7.1).\nTable 7.1\nSymbols/T erms/Phrases Meaning\n( )f x dx∫ Integral of f  with respect to x\nf(x) in ( )f x dx∫Integrand\nx in  ( )f x dx∫ Variable of integration\nIntegrate Find the  integral\nAn integral of f A function F such that\nF′(x) = f (x)\nIntegration The process of finding the integral\nConstant of Integration Any real number C, considered as\nconstant function\nReprint 2025-26\n\n228 MATHEMA TICS\nWe already know the formulae for the derivatives of many important functions.\nFrom these formulae, we can write down immediately the corresponding formulae\n(referred to as standard formulae) for the integrals of these functions, as listed below\nwhich will be used to find integrals of other functions.\nDerivatives Integrals (Anti derivatives)\n(i)1\n1n\nn d xxdx n+ = +  ;1\nC1n\nn xx dxn+\n= ++∫, n ≠ –1\nParticularly , we note that\n( ) 1dxdx= ;       C dx x= +∫\n(ii) ( )sin cosdx xdx=  ; cos sin Cx dx x= +∫\n(iii) ( )– cos sindx xdx=  ; sin cos Cx dx – x= +∫\n(iv) ( )2tan secdx xdx=  ;2sec tan C x dx x= +∫\n(v) ( )2– cot cosecdx xdx=  ;2cosec cot C x dx – x= +∫\n(vi) ( )sec sec tandx x xdx=  ; sec tan sec Cx x dx x = +∫\n(vii) ( )– cosec cosec cotdx x xdx=  ; cosec cot – cosec C x x dx x = + ∫\n(viii) ( )– 1\n21sin\n1dxdx – x= ;– 1\n2sin C\n1dxx\n– x= +∫\n(ix) ( )– 1\n21– cos\n1dxdx – x= ;– 1\n2cos C\n1dx– x\n– x= +∫\n(x) ( )– 1\n21tan\n1dxdx x=\n+ ;– 1\n2tan C\n1dxx\nx= +\n+∫\n(xi) ( )x x de edx= ; Cx xe dx e = +∫\nReprint 2025-26\n\nINTEGRALS         229\n(xii) ( )1log | |dxdx x=;1log | | C dx xx= +∫\n(xiii)x\nx d aadx log a = \n  ; Cx\nx aa dxlog a= +∫\n/handptrtsld1Note   In practice, we normally do not mention the interval over which the various\nfunctions are defined. However , in any specific problem one has to keep it in mind.\n7.2.1  Some properties of indefinite integral\nIn this sub section, we shall derive some properties of indefinite integrals.\n(I)The process of differentiation and integration are inverses of each other in the\nsense of the following results :\n( )df x dxdx∫ =f(x)\nand ( )f x dx′∫  =f(x) + C, where C is any arbitrary constant.\nProof  Let F be any anti derivative of f, i.e.,\nF( )dxdx =f(x)\nThen ( )f x dx∫  =F(x) + C\nTherefore ( )df x dxdx∫ = ( )F ( ) + Cdxdx\n= F ( ) = ( )dx f xdx\nSimilarly , we note that\nf′(x) = ( )df xdx\nand hence ( )f x dx′∫  =f(x) + C\nwhere C is arbitrary constant called constant of integration.\n(II) Two indefinite integrals with the same derivative lead to the same family of\ncurves and so they are equivalent.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n230 MATHEMA TICS\nProof  Let f and g be two functions such that\n( )df x dxdx∫ = ( )dg x dxdx∫\nor ( ) ( )df x dx – g x dxdx   ∫ ∫ = 0\nHence ( ) ( )f x dx – g x dx∫ ∫ =C, where C is any real number   (Why?)\nor ( )f x dx∫  = ( ) Cg x dx +∫\nSo the families of curves { } 1 1 ( ) C , C Rf x dx + ∈∫\nand { } 2 2 ( ) C , C Rg x dx + ∈∫  are identical.\nHence, in this sense, ( ) and ( )f x dx g x dx∫ ∫ are equivalent.\n/handptrtsld1Note  The equivalence of the families { } 1 1 ( ) + C ,Cf x dx ∈ ∫R and\n{ } 2 2 ( ) + C ,Cg x dx ∈ ∫R is customarily expressed by writing ( ) = ( )f x dx g x dx∫ ∫ ,\nwithout mentioning the parameter .\n(III) [ ] ( ) + ( ) ( ) + ( )f x g x dx f x dx g x dx = ∫ ∫ ∫\nProof By Property (I), we have\n[ ( ) + ( )]df x g x dxdx   ∫  =f(x) + g(x) ...

The search for the requisite function for finding\nan anti derivative is known as integration by the method of inspection. We illustrate it\nthrough some examples.\nExample 1  Write an anti derivative for each of the following functions using the\nmethod of inspection:\n(i)cos 2 x (ii) 3x2 + 4x3(iii)1\nx, x ≠ 0\nSolution\n(i)We look for a function whose derivative is cos 2 x. Recall that\nd\ndx sin 2 x =2 cos 2 x\nor cos 2x  = 1\n2d\ndx (sin 2 x) =1sin 22dxdx \n  \nTherefore, an anti derivative of cos 2 x is 1sin 22x.\n(ii) We look for a function whose derivative is 3 x2 + 4x3. Note that\n( )3 4 dx xdx+ = 3x2 + 4x3.\nTherefore, an anti derivative of 3 x2 + 4x3  is  x3 + x4.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n232 MATHEMA TICS\n(iii) We know that\n1 1 1(log ) 0 and [log ( )] ( 1) 0d dx ,x –x – ,xdx x dx –x x= > = = <\nCombining above, we get ( )1log 0dx ,xdx x= ≠\nTherefore, 1logdx xx=∫  is one of the anti derivatives of 1\nx.\nExample 2  Find the following integrals:\n(i)3\n21x –dx\nx∫ (ii)   2\n3( 1)x dx+∫(iii)   ∫3\n21( 2 – )+ xx e dxx\nSolution\n(i)We have\n3\n2\n21 – x –dx xdx– x dx\nx=∫ ∫ ∫(by Property V)\n= 1 1 2 1\n1 2 C C1 1 2 1–x x––+ +   + +    + +   ;  C1, C2 are constants of integration\n= 2 1\n1 2 C C2 1–x x– ––+  = 2\n1 21+ C C2x–x+\n= 21+ C2x\nx+ , where C = C1 – C2 is another constant of integration.\nANote   From now onwards, we shall write only one constant of integration in the\nfinal answer .\n(ii)We have\n2 2\n3 3 ( 1)x dx x dx dx+ = +∫ ∫ ∫\n=21\n3\nC213xx+\n+ +\n+ = 5\n33C5x x+ +\nReprint 2025-26\n\nINTEGRALS         233\n(iii)We have 3 3\n2 21 1( 2 ) 2x xx e – dx x dx e dx – dxx x+ = + ∫ ∫ ∫ ∫\n=312\n2 – log + C312x xe x+\n+\n+\n=5\n222 – log + C5xx e x+\nExample 3  Find the following integrals:\n(i) (sin cos )x x dx+∫ (ii)cosec (cosec cot ) x x x dx + ∫\n(iii) 21 sin\ncos– xdx\nx∫\nSolution\n(i)We have\n(sin cos ) sin cosx x dx x dx x dx+ = +∫ ∫ ∫\n= – cos sin C x x+ +\n(ii) We have\n2(cosec (cosec + cot ) cosec cosec cot x x x dx x dx x x dx = + ∫ ∫ ∫\n= – cot cosec C x – x +\n(iii) We have\n2 2 21 sin 1 sin\ncos cos\ncos– x xdx dx – dx\nx x x=∫ ∫ ∫\n= 2sec tan secx dx – x x dx∫ ∫\n= tan sec Cx – x +\nExample 4  Find the anti derivative F of  f defined by f (x) = 4 x3 – 6, where F (0) = 3\nSolution One anti derivative of f (x) is x4 – 6x since\n4( 6 )dx – xdx =4x3 – 6\nTherefore, the anti derivative F is given by\nF(x) =x4 – 6x + C, where C is constant.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n234 MATHEMA TICS\nGiven that F(0) = 3, which gives,\n3 =0 – 6 × 0 + C    or    C = 3\nHence, the required anti derivative is the unique function F defined by\nF(x) =x4 – 6x + 3.\nRemarks\n(i)We see that if F is an anti derivative of f, then so is F + C, where C is any\nconstant. Thus, if we know one anti derivative F of a function f, we can write\ndown an infinite number of anti derivatives of f by adding any constant to F\nexpressed by F(x)  + C, C ∈ R. In applications, it is often necessary to satisfy an\nadditional condition which then determines a specific value of C giving unique\nanti derivative of the given function.\n(ii) Sometimes, F is not expressible in terms of elementary functions viz., polynomial,\nlogarithmic, exponential, trigonometric functions and their inverses etc. We are\ntherefore blocked for finding ( )f x dx∫ . For example, it is not possible to find\n2– xe dx∫ by inspection since we can not find a function whose derivative is 2– xe\n(iii) When the variable of integration is denoted by a variable other than x, the integral\nformulae are modified accordingly .

It was based on inspection, i.e., on the\nsearch of a function F whose derivative is f which led us to the integral of f. However ,\nthis method, which depends on inspection, is not very suitable for many functions.\nHence, we need to develop additional techniques or methods for finding the integrals\nby reducing them into standard forms. Prominent among them are methods based on:\n1.Integration by Substitution\n2.Integration using Partial Fractions\n3.Integration by Parts\n7.3.1  Integration by substitution\nIn this section, we consider the method of integration by substitution.\nThe given integral ( )f x dx∫  can be transformed into another form by changing\nthe independent variable x to t by substituting x = g (t).\nReprint 2025-26\n\n236 MATHEMA TICS\nConsider I = ( )f x dx∫\nPut x = g(t) so that dx\ndt = g′(t).\nWe write dx =g′(t) dt\nThus I = ( ) ( ( )) ( )f x dx f g t g t dt = ′∫ ∫\nThis change of variable formula is one of the important tools available to us in the\nname of integration by substitution. It is often important to guess what will be the useful\nsubstitution. Usually , we make a substitution for a function whose derivative also occurs\nin the integrand as illustrated in the following examples.\nExample 5 Integrate the following functions w .r.t. x:\n(i)sin mx (ii) 2x sin ( x2 + 1)\n(iii)4 2tan sec x x\nx(iv)1\n2sin (tan )\n1–x\nx+\nSolution\n(i)We know that derivative of mx  is m. Thus, we make the substitution\nmx = t so that mdx  = dt.\nTherefore,      1sin sinmx dx t dtm=∫ ∫  =  – 1\nmcos t + C  = – 1\nmcos mx  + C\n(ii) Derivative of x2 + 1 is 2 x. Thus, we use the substitution x2 + 1 = t so that\n2x dx = dt .\nTherefore,  22 sin ( 1) sinx x dx t dt + =∫ ∫  =  – cos t + C  = – cos ( x2 + 1) + C\n(iii) Derivative of x is 1\n21 1\n2 2–\nx\nx= . Thus, we use the substitution\n1so that giving\n2x t dx dt\nx= =  dx = 2t dt.\nThus,4 2 4 2tan sec 2 tan sec x x t t t dtdxt x= ∫ ∫  = 4 22 tan sec t t dt∫\nAgain, we make another substitution tan t = u so that sec2 t dt = du\nReprint 2025-26\n\nINTEGRALS         237\nTherefore,4 2 42 tan sec 2 t t dt u du =∫ ∫  = 5\n2 C5u+\n=5 2tan C5t+ (since u = tan t)\n=5 2tan C (since )5x t x+ =\nHence,4 2tan sec x xdx\nx∫  =5 2tan C5x+\nAlternatively , make the substitution tan x t=\n(iv) Derivative of  1\n21tan\n1–x\nx=\n+. Thus, we use the substitution\ntan–1 x = t so that 21dx\nx+ = dt.\nTherefore ,  1\n2sin (tan )sin\n1–xdx t dt\nx=\n+∫ ∫ =  – cos t + C = – co s(tan –1x) + C\nNow , we discuss some important integrals involving trigonometric functions and\ntheir standard integrals using substitution technique.

In this\nsection, we shall study what is called definite integral of a function. The definite integral\nhas a unique value. A definite integral is denoted by ( )b\naf x dx∫, where a is called the\nlower limit of the integral and b is called the upper limit of the integral. The definite\nintegral is introduced either as the limit of a sum or if it has an anti derivative F in the\ninterval [a , b], then its value is the difference  between the values of F at the end\npoints, i.e., F (b) – F(a) .\n7.8  Fundamental Theorem of Calculus\n7.8.1   Area function\nWe have defined ( )b\naf x dx∫ as the area of\nthe region bounded by the curve y = f(x),\nthe ordinates x = a and x = b and x-axis. Let x\nbe a given point in [a , b]. Then ( )x\naf x dx∫\nrepresents the area of the light shaded region\nin Fig 7.1 [Here it is assumed that f(x) > 0 for\nx ∈ [a, b], the assertion made below is\nequally true for other functions as well].\nThe area of this shaded region depends upon\nthe value of x.\nIn other words, the area of this shaded region is a function of x. We denote this\nfunction of x by A(x). We call the function A(x) as Area function  and is given by\nA(x) =∫( )x\naf x dx ... (1)\nBased on this definition, the two basic fundamental theorems have been given.\nHowever , we only state them as their proofs are beyond the scope of this text book.\n7.8.2   First fundamental theorem of integral calculus\nTheor em 1 Let f be a continuous function on the closed interval [ a, b] and let A (x) be\nthe area function. Then A ′ ′′ ′′(x) = f (x), for all x ∈ ∈∈ ∈∈ [a, b].Fig 7.1\nReprint 2025-26\n\n268 MATHEMA TICS\n7.8.3   Second fundamental theorem of integral calculus\nWe state below an important theorem which enables us to evaluate definite integrals\nby making use of anti derivative.\nTheorem 2  Let f  be continuous function defined on the closed interval [ a, b] and F be\nan anti derivative of f. Then ∫( )b\naf x dx = [F( )] =b\nax  F (b) – F( a).\nRemarks\n(i)In words, the Theorem 2 tells us that ( )b\naf x dx∫= (value of the anti derivative F\nof f at the upper limit b – value of the same anti derivative at the lower limit a).\n(ii) This theorem is very useful, because it gives us a method of calculating the\ndefinite integral more easily , without calculating the limit of a sum.\n(iii) The crucial operation in evaluating a definite integral is that of finding a function\nwhose derivative is equal to the integrand. This strengthens the relationship\nbetween differentiation and integration.\n(iv) In ( )b\naf x dx∫, the function f needs to be well defined and continuous in [ a, b].\nFor instance, the consideration of definite integral 132 2\n2( –1)x x dx\n−∫ is erroneous\nsince the function f expressed by f(x) = 1\n2 2 ( –1)x x  is not defined in a portion\n– 1 < x < 1 of the closed interval [– 2, 3].\nSteps for  calculating ( )b\naf x dx∫.\n(i)Find the indefinite integral ( )f x dx∫ .

One of the important methods for finding the indefinite integral is the method\nof substitution.\nTo evaluate ( )b\naf x dx∫, by substitution, the steps could be as follows:\n1.Consider the integral without limits and substitute, y = f(x) or x = g(y) to reduce\nthe given integral to a known form.\n2.Integrate the new integrand with respect to the new variable without mentioning\nthe constant of integration.\n3.Resubstitute for the new variable and write the answer in terms of the original\nvariable.\n4.Find the values of answers obtained in (3) at the given limits of integral and find\nthe difference of the values at the upper and lower limits.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n272 MATHEMA TICS\n/handptrtsld1Note  In order to quicken this method, we can proceed as follows: After\nperforming steps 1, and 2, there is no need of step 3. Here, the integral will be kept\nin the new variable itself, and the limits of the integral will accordingly be changed,\nso that we can perform the last step.\nLet us illustrate this by examples.\nExample 26  Evaluate 14 5\n15 1x x dx\n−+∫.\nSolution Put  t  = x5 + 1, then dt = 5x4 dx.\nTherefore,4 55 1x x dx +∫  = t dt∫  = 3\n22\n3t = 3\n5 22( 1)3x+\nHence,14 5\n15 1x x dx\n−+∫  =13\n5 2\n– 12( 1)3x \n+ \n  \n= ( )3 3\n5 5 2 22(1 1) – (– 1) 13 \n+ +  \n   \n=3 3\n2 222 03 \n− \n   = 2 4 2(2 2)3 3=\nAlternatively , first we transform the integral and then evaluate the transformed integral\nwith new limits.\nLet t =x5 + 1.

In the differential calculus,\nwe are given a function and we have to find the derivative or differential of\nthis function, but in the integral calculus, we are to find a function whose\ndifferential is given. Thus, integration is a process which is the inverse of\ndifferentiation.\nLet F( ) ( )dx f xdx= . Then we write ( ) F ( ) Cf x dx x = +∫ . These integrals\nare called indefinite integrals or general integrals, C is called constant of\nintegration.
