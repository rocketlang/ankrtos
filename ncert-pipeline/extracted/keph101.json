For this we should know the\ndependence of the physical quantity on other\nquantities (upto three physical quantities or\nlinearly independent variables) and consider it\nas a product type of the dependence. Let us take\nan example.\nExample 1.5 Consider a simple\npendulum, having a bob attached to astring, that oscillates under the action of\nthe force of gravity. Suppose that the period\nof oscillation of the simple pendulum\ndepends on its length  ( l), mass of the bob\n(m) and acceleration due to gravity ( g).\nDerive the expression for its time period\nusing method of dimensions.\nAnswer   The dependence of time period T on\nthe  quantities l, g and m as a product may be\nwritten as :\nT = k lx gy mz\nwhere k is dimensionless constant and x, y\nand z are the exponents.\nBy considering dimensions on both sides, we\nhave\no o 1 1 1 –2 1[L M T ]=[L ] [L T ] [M ]x y z\n= Lx+y T–2y  Mz\nOn equating the dimensions on both sides,\nwe have\nx + y = 0; –2 y = 1; and z = 0\nSo that 1 1, – , 02 2x y z= = =\nThen, T = k l½ g–½\nor, T = lkg\nNote that value of constant k can not be obtained\nby the method of dimensions. Here it does not\nmatter if some number multiplies the right side\nof this formula, because that does not affect its\ndimensions.\nActually, k = 2π so that T = 2l\ngπ ⊳\nDimensional analysis is very useful in deducing\nrelations among the interdependent physical\nquantities. However , dimensionless constants\ncannot be obtained by this method. The method\nof dimensions can only test the dimensional\nvalidity, but not  the exact relationship between\nphysical quantities in any equation. It does not\ndistinguish between the physical quantities\nhaving same dimensions.\nA number of exercises at the end of this\nchapter will help you develop skill in\ndimensional analysis.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPHYSICS 10\nSUMMARY\n1.Physics is a quantitative science, based on measurement of physical quantities.  Certain\nphysical quantities have been chosen as fundamental or base quantities (such as\nlength, mass, time, electric current, thermodynamic temperature, amount of substance,\nand luminous intensity).\n2.Each base quantity is defined in terms of a certain basic, arbitrarily chosen but properly\nstandardised reference standard called unit (such as metre, kilogram, second, ampere,\nkelvin, mole and candela).  The units for the fundamental or base quantities are called\nfundamental or base units.\n3.Other physical quantities, derived from the base quantities, can be expressed as a\ncombination of the base units and are called derived units.  A complete set of units,\nboth fundamental and derived, is called a system of units.\n4.The International System of Units (SI) based on seven base units is at present\ninternationally accepted unit system and is widely used throughout the world.\n5.The SI units are used in all physical measurements, for both the base quantities and\nthe derived quantities obtained from them.  Certain derived units are expressed by\nmeans of SI units with special names (such as joule, newton, watt, etc).\n6.The SI units have well defined and internationally accepted unit symbols (such as m\nfor metre, kg for kilogram, s for second, A for ampere, N for newton etc.).\n7.Physical measurements are usually expressed for small and large quantities in scientific\nnotation, with powers of 10.  Scientific notation and the prefixes are used to simplify\nmeasurement notation and numerical computation, giving indication to the precision\nof the numbers.\n8.Certain general rules and guidelines must be followed for using notations for physical\nquantities and standard symbols for SI units, some other units and SI prefixes for\nexpressing properly the physical quantities and measurements.\n9.In computing any physical quantity, the units for derived quantities involved in the\nrelationship(s) are treated as though they were algebraic quantities till the desired\nunits are obtained.\n10.In measured and computed quantities proper significant figures only should be retained.\nRules for determining the number of significant figures, carrying out arithmetic\noperations with them, and ‘rounding off ‘ the uncertain digits must be followed.\n11.The dimensions of base quantities and combination of these dimensions describe\nthe nature of physical quantities. Dimensional analysis can be used to check the\ndimensional consistency of equations, deducing relations among the physical\nquantities, etc. A dimensionally consistent equation need not be actually an\nexact (correct) equation, but a dimensionally wrong or inconsistent equation\nmust be wrong.\nEXERCISES\nNote : In stating numerical answers, take care of significant figures.\n1.1 Fill in the blanks\n(a) The volume of a cube of side 1 cm is equal to .....m3\n(b) The surface area of a solid cylinder of radius 2.0 cm and height 10.0 cm is equal to\n      ...(mm)2\n(c) A vehicle moving with a speed of 18 km h–1 covers....m in 1 s\n(d) The relative density of lead is 11.3.

Suppose we employ a system of units in which the unit of mass equals α\nkg, the unit of length equals β m, the unit of time is γ s.  Show that a calorie has a\nmagnitude 4.2 α–1 β–2 γ2 in terms of the new units.\n1.4 Explain this statement clearly :\n“To call a dimensional quantity ‘large’ or ‘small’ is meaningless without specifying a\nstandard for comparison”. In view of this, reframe the following statements wherever\nnecessary :\n(a) atoms are very small objects\n(b) a jet plane moves with great speed\n(c) the mass of Jupiter is very large\n(d) the air inside this room contains a large number of molecules\n(e) a proton is much more massive than an electron\n(f) the speed of sound is much smaller than the speed of light.\n1.5 A new unit of length is chosen such that the speed of light in vacuum is unity. What\nis the distance between the Sun and the Earth in terms of the new unit if light takes\n8 min and 20 s to cover this distance ?\n1.6 Which of the following is the most precise device for measuring length :\n(a) a vernier callipers with 20 divisions on the sliding scale\n(b) a screw gauge of pitch 1 mm and 100 divisions on the circular scale\n(c) an optical instrument that can measure length to within a wavelength of light ?\n1.7 A student measures the thickness of a human hair by looking at it through a\nmicroscope of magnification 100. He makes 20 observations and finds that the average\nwidth of the hair in the field of view of the microscope is 3.5 mm. What is the\nestimate on the thickness of hair ?\n1.8 Answer the following :\n(a)You ar e given a thr ead and a metr e scale.  How will you estimate the diameter of\nthe thread ?\n(b)A screw gauge has a pitch of 1.0 mm and 200 divisions on the circular scale. Do\nyou think it is possible to increase the accuracy of the screw gauge arbitrarily by\nincreasing the number of divisions on the circular scale ?\n(c)The mean diameter of a thin brass rod is to be measured by  vernier callipers.  Why\nis a set of 100 measurements of the diameter expected to yield a more reliable\nestimate than a set of 5 measurements only ?\n1.9 The photograph of a house occupies an area of 1.75 cm2 on a 35 mm slide.  The slide\nis projected on to a screen, and the area of the house on the screen is 1.55 m2.  What\nis the linear magnification of the pr ojector -screen arrangement.\n1.10 State the number of significant figures in the following :\n(a)  0.007 m2\n(b)  2.64 × 1024 kg\n(c)  0.2370 g cm–3\n(d)  6.320 J\n(e)  6.032 N m–2\n(f)   0.0006032 m2\n1.11 The length, breadth and thickness of a rectangular sheet of metal are 4.234 m, 1.005 m, and\n2.01 cm respectively. Give the area and volume of the sheet to correct significant figures.\n1.12 The mass of a box measured by a grocer’s balance is 2.30 kg. Two gold pieces of\nmasses 20.15 g  and 20.17 g are added to the box.  What is (a) the total mass of the\nbox, (b) the difference in the masses of the pieces to correct significant figures ?\n1.13 A famous relation in physics relates ‘moving mass’ m to the ‘rest mass’ mo of a\nparticle in terms of its speed v and the speed of light, c.  (This relation first arose as\na consequence of special relativity due to Albert Einstein). A boy recalls the relation\nalmost correctly but forgets where to put the constant c.  He writes :\n( )mm\n1 v0=\n−21/2.\nGuess where to put the missing c.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPHYSICS 12\n1.14 The unit of length convenient on the atomic scale is known as an angstrom and is\ndenoted by Å: 1 Å = 10–10 m. The size of a hydrogen atom is about 0.5 Å. What is the\ntotal  atomic volume in m3 of a mole of hydrogen atoms ?\n1.15 One mole of an ideal gas at standard temperature and pressure occupies 22.4 L\n(molar volume). What is the ratio of molar volume to the atomic volume of a mole of\nhydrogen ?   (Take the size of  hydrogen molecule to be about 1 Å). Why is this ratio\nso large ?\n1.16 Explain this common observation clearly : If you look out of the window of a fast\nmoving train, the nearby trees, houses etc. seem to move rapidly in a direction opposite\nto the train’s motion, but the distant objects (hill tops, the Moon, the stars etc.)\nseem to be stationary. (In fact, since you  are aware that you are moving, these\ndistant objects seem to move with you).\n1.17 The Sun is a hot plasma (ionized matter) with its inner core at a temperature exceeding\n107 K, and its outer surface at a temperature of about 6000 K. At these high\ntemperatures, no substance remains in a solid or liquid phase. In what range do you\nexpect the mass density of the Sun to be, in the range of densities of solids and\nliquids or gases ?  Check if your guess is correct from the following data : mass of the\nSun = 2.0 ×1030 kg, radius of the Sun = 7.0 × 108 m.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n",
