      "content": "Chapter 6, we have seen that the concept of\npotential energy is possible only for conservative\nforces. The spring force F = –kx  is a conservative\nforce, with associated potential energy\n2 1\n2U = k x (13.16)\nHence the potential energy of a particle\nexecuting simple harmonic motion is,\nU(x)  =   2\n21x  k  \n         2 2 1cos ( + )2= k A t ω φ  (13.17)\nThus, the potential energy of a particle\nexecuting simple harmonic motion is also\nperiodic, with period T/2, being zero at the mean\nposition and maximum at the extreme\ndisplacements.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nOSCILLATIONS 269\nIt follows from Eqs. (13.15) and (13.17) that\nthe total energy, E, of the system is,\nE  = U + K\n2 2 2 2  1 1cos ( + ) + sin ( + )2 2=  k A t  k A t ω φ ω φ\n2 2 2 1cos ( + ) + sin ( + )2=  k A t t ω φ ω φ   \nUsing the familiar trigonometric identity, the\nvalue of the expression in the brackets is unity.\nThus,\n2 1\n2E =  k A (13.18)\nThe total mechanical energy of a harmonic\noscillator is thus independent of time as\nexpected for motion under any conservative\nforce. The time and displacement dependence\nof the potential and kinetic energies of a\nlinear simple harmonic oscillator are shown\nin Fig. 1 3.16.Observe that both kinetic energy and\npotential energy in SHM are seen to be always\npositive in Fig. 1 3.16. Kinetic energy can, of\ncourse, be never negative, since it is\nproportional to the square of speed. Potential\nenergy is positive by choice of the undermined\nconstant in potential energy. Both kinetic\nenergy and potential energy peak twice during\neach period of SHM. For x = 0, the energy is\nkinetic; at the extremes x = ±A, it is all\npotential energy. In the course of motion\nbetween these limits, kinetic energy increases\nat the expense of potential energy or\nvice-versa.\nu Example 13.7   A block whose mass is 1 kg\nis fastened to a spring. The spring has a\nspring constant of 50 N m–1. The block is\npulled to a distance x = 10 cm from its\nequilibrium position at x = 0 on a frictionless\nsurface from rest at t = 0. Calculate the\nkinetic, potential and total energies of the\nblock when it is 5 cm away from the mean\nposition.\nAnswer  The block executes SHM, its angular\nfrequency, as given by Eq.

The stone executes a to and fro motion,\nit is periodic with a period of about two seconds.\nWe shall show that this periodic motion is\nsimple harmonic for small displacements fromOrcos (7.07 t) = 0.5 and hence\nsin (7.07 t)  =3\n2  = 0.866\nThen, the velocity of the block at x = 5 cm is\n      = 0.1  × 7.07 × 0.866 m s–1\n          = 0.61 m s–1\nHence the K.E. of the block,\n \n21 =  2  v m\n           = ½[1kg  × (0.6123 m s–1 )2 ]\n           = 0.19 J\nThe P .E. of the block,\n  \n21 =  2x  k  \n           = ½(50 N m–1 × 0.05 m  × 0.05 m)\n           = 0.0625 J\nThe total energy of the block at x = 5 cm,\n           =  K.E. + P .E.\n           =  0.25 J\nwe also know that at maximum  displacement,\nK.E. is zero and hence the total energy of the\nsystem is equal to the P .E. Ther efore, the total\nenergy of the system,\n          = ½(50 N m–1 ×  0.1 m  × 0.1 m )\n          = 0.25 J\nwhich is same as the sum of the two energies at\na displacement of 5 cm. This is in conformity\nwith the principle of conservation of energy.   ⊳\n13.8 The Simple Pendulum\nIt is said that Galileo measured the periods of a\nswinging chandelier in a church by his pulse\nbeats. He observed that the motion of the\nchandelier was periodic. The system is a kind\nof pendulum. Y ou can also make your own\npendulum by tying a piece of stone to a long\nunstretchable thread , approximately 100 cm\nlong.  Suspend your pendulum from a suitable\nsupport so that it is free to oscillate. Displace\nthe stone to one side by a small distance and(a)\n (b)\nFig. 13.17 (a) A bob oscillating about its mean\nposition. (b) The radial force T-mg cos θ\nprovides centripetal force but no torque\nabout the support. The tangential force\nmg sin θ provides the restoring torque.\nthe mean position. Consider simple pendulum\n— a small bob of mass m tied to an inextensible\nmassless string of length L. The other end of\nthe string is fixed to a rigid support. The bob\noscillates in a plane about the vertical line\nthrough the support. Fig. 13.17(a) shows this\nsystem. Fig. 13.17(b) is a kind of ‘free-body’\ndiagram of the simple pendulum showing the\nforces acting on the bob.\nLet θ be the angle made by the string with\nthe vertical. When the bob is at the mean\nposition, θ = 0\nThere are only two forces acting on the bob;\nthe tension T along the string and the vertical\nReprint 2025-26\n\nOSCILLATIONS 271\nforce due to gravity (=mg). The force mg can be\nresolved into the component mg cosθ along the\nstring and mg sin θ perpendicular to it. Since\nthe motion of the bob is along a circle of length\nL and centre at the support point, the bob has\na radial acceleration ( ω2L) and also a tangental\nacceleration; the latter arises since motion along\nthe arc of the circle is not uniform. The radial\nacceleration is provided by the net radial force\nT –mg cosθ, while the tangential acceleration is\nprovided by mg sin θ. It is more convenient to\nwork with torque about the support since the\nradial force gives zero torque. Torque τ about\nthe support is entirely provided by the tangental\ncomponent of force\nτ =  –L (mg sinθ) (13.19)\nThis is the restoring torque that tends to reduce\nangular displacement — hence the negative\nsign. By Newton’s law of rotational motion,\nτ   =  I α (13.20)\nwhere I is the moment of inertia of the system\nabout the support and α is the angular\nacceleration. Thus,\nI α = –m g sin θ   L (13.21)\nOr,\nα  =  sin  m g L  I θ − (13.22)\nWe can simplify Eq. (13.22) if we assume that\nthe displacement θ is small. W e know that sin θ\ncan be expressed as,\nsin  ± ...3! 5!  θ θθ θ3 5\n  =  − + (13.23)\nwhere θ is in radians.\nNow if θ  is small, sin θ can be approximated\nby θ and Eq. (13.22) can then be written as,\n α θ   =  −  mgL\nI (13.24)\nIn Table 1 3.1, we have listed the angle θ in\ndegrees, its equivalent in radians, and the\nvalue of the function sin θ . From this table it\ncan be seen that for θ as large as 20 degrees,\nsin θ is nearly the same as θ expressed\nin radians .Table 13.1  sin θ θθ θθ as ma function of angle θ θθ θθ\n(degrees) (radians) sin\nEquation (13.24) is mathematically, identical to\nEq. (13.11) except that the variable is angular\ndisplacement. Hence we have proved that for\nsmall q, the motion of the bob is simple harmonic.\nFrom Eqs. (13.24) and (13.11),\nω  =  mgL\nI \nand\n IT  mgLπ  = 2       (13.25)\nNow since the string of the simple pendulum\nis massless, the moment of inertia I is simply\nmL2. Eq. (13.25) then gives the well-known\nformula for time period of a simple pendulum.\nLT  gπ  =  2     (13.26)\nuExample 13.8  What is the length of a\nsimple pendulum, which ticks seconds ?\nAnswer  From Eq. (13.26), the time period of a\nsimple pendulum is given by,\n LT  gπ  =  2   \nFrom this relation one gets,\n2\n2 4gTLπ  =   \nThe time period of a simple pendulum, which\nticks seconds, is 2 s.

The motion that repeats itself is called periodlic motion.\n2. The period T  is the time reequired for one complete oscillation, or cycle. It is related to\nthe frequency v by,\n1Tv=\nThe frequency  ν of periodic or oscillatory motion is the number of oscillations per\nunit time. In the SI, it is measured in hertz :\n                      1 hertz = 1 Hz = 1 oscillation per second = 1s–1\n3. In simple harmonic motion  (SHM), the displacement x (t) of a particle from its\nequilibrium position is given by,\nx (t)  = A cos ( ωt + φ ) (displacement),\nin which A  is the amplitude  of the displacement, the quantity  ( ωt + φ ) is the phase of\nthe motion, and φ is the phase constant . The angular frequency  ω is related to the\nperiod and frequency of the motion by ,\n                         22     Tπω πν= = (angular frequency).\n4. Simple harmonic motion can also be viewed as the projection of uniform circular\nmotion on the diameter of the circle in which the latter motion occurs.\n5. The particle velocity and acceleration during SHM as functions of time are given by,\nv (t)  =  – ωA sin ( ωt + φ )            (velocity),\n                        a (t)  =  – ω2A cos ( ωt + φ )\n                                = –ω2x (t)                            (acceleration),\nThus we see that both velocity and acceleration of a body executing simple harmonic\nmotion are periodic functions, having the velocity amplitude  vm=ω A  and acceleration\namplitude  am =ω2A, respectively.\n6. The force acting in a simple harmonic motion is proportional to the displacement and\nis always directed towards the centre of motion.\n7. A particle executing simple harmonic motion has, at any time, kinetic energy\nK = ½ mv2  and potential energy U = ½ kx2.  If no friction is present the mechanical\nenergy of the system, E = K + U  always remains constant even though K and U change\nwith time.\n8. A particle of mass m oscillating under the influence of Hooke’s law restoring force\ngiven by F = – k x  exhibits simple harmonic motion with\nω k\nm=(angular frequency)\n2mT kπ= (period)\nSuch a system is also called a linear oscillator .\n9. The motion of a simple pendulum swinging through small angles is approximately\nsimple harmonic. The period of oscillation is given by,\n2LTgπ=\nReprint 2025-26\n\nOSCILLATIONS 273\nPOINTS TO PONDER\n1. The period T is the  least time after which motion repeats itself.  Thus, motion repeats\nitself after nT wher e n is an integer .\n2. Every periodic motion is not simple harmonic motion. Only that periodic motion\ngoverned by the force law F = – k x is simple harmonic.\n3. Circular motion can arise due to an inverse-square law force (as in planetary motion)\nas well as due to simple har monic for ce in two dimensions equal to: – mω2r.  In the\nlatter case, the phases of motion, in two perpendicular directions ( x and y) must differ\nby π/2. Thus, for example, a particle subject to a force  – mω2r with initial position (0,\nA) and velocity ( ωA, 0) will move uniformly in a circle of radius A.\n4. For linear simple harmonic motion with a given ω, two initial conditions are necessary\nand sufficient to determine the motion completely.  The  initial  conditions may be (i)\ninitial position and initial velocity or (ii) amplitude and phase or (iii) energy\nand phase.\n5. From point 4 above, given  amplitude or energy, phase of motion is determined by the\ninitial position or initial velocity.\n6. A combination of two simple harmonic motions with arbitrary amplitudes and phases\nis not necessarily periodic.  It is periodic only if frequency of one motion is an integral\nmultiple of the other’s fr equency.  However , a periodic motion can always be expr essed\nas a sum of infinite number of harmonic motions with appropriate amplitudes.\n",
