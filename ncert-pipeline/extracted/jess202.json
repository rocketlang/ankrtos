      "content": "CHAPTER 2:   SECTORS OF THE INDIAN ECONOMY\nAn economy is best understood when we\nstudy its components or sectors. Sectoral\nclassification can be done on the basis of\nseveral criteria. I n this chapter , thre e\ntypes of classifications are discussed:\nprimary/secondary/tertiary; organised/\nunorganised; and public/private. Y ou can\ncreate a discussion about these types by\ntaking examples familiar to the students\nand relate them to their daily life. It is\nimportant to emphasise the changing\nroles of sectors. This can be highlighted\nfurther by drawing attention of the\nstudents to the rapid growth of service\nsector . While elaborating the ideas\nprovided in the chapter , the students may\nneed to be familiarised with a few\nfundamental concepts such as Gross\nDomestic Product, Employment etc. Since\nthe students may find this difficult to\nunderstand, it is necessary to explain to\nthem through examples. Several activities\nand exercises are suggested in the chapter\nto help the students understand how a\nperson’s activity could be placed —\nwhether in the primary, secondary or\ntertiary, organised or unorganised, and\npublic or private sector . You may\nencourage the students to talk to various\nworking people around them (such as\nshop owners, casual workers, vegetable\nvendors, workshop mechanics, domestic\nworkers etc.) to know more about how they\nlive and work. Based on such information,\nthe students can be encouraged to\ndevelop their own classification of\neconomic activities.\nAnother important issue to be\nhighlighted is about the problems caused\nby the changes in the roles of sectors.\nThe chapter has taken the example of\nunemployment and what the government\ncan do to solve it. The declining importance\nof agriculture and growing importance ofindustry and services should be related\nto the experience of the children by taking\nmore examples that they may observe in\ntheir day-to-day life. Information derived\nfrom the media could be used for this\npurpose. Y ou may encourage the students\nto bring important cuttings and stories\nfrom newspapers, which could be\nprominently displayed in storyboards, and\nencourage the class to discuss these\nissues. While discussing the unorganised\nsector , the key issue of protecting the\nworkers engaged in the sector should be\nhighlighted. Y ou may  also encourage the\nstudents to visit persons and enterprises\nin the unorganised sector and get a first\nhand experience from real life situation.\nSources for Information\nThe G VA data used in this chapter\npertaining to Real G ross V alue Added at\nBasic Prices by Industry of Origin at\n2011–12 prices is taken from Economic\nSurvey. It is a valuable source of G VA and\nother information relating to the Indian\neconomy . For evaluation purposes,\nparticularly to develop the analytical\nability of learners, teachers can refer to\nthis report through the Internet to get data\nfor dif ferent years.  Due to change in\nmethodology , latest data is not used in the\nchapter .\nThe employment figures are based\non data taken from the five-yearly surveys\non employment and unemployment\nconducted by the National Sample Survey\nOrganisation (NSSO) now known as\nNational Statistical Office (NSO). NSO is\nan organisation under the Ministry of\nStatistics and Programme Implementation,\nGovernment of India. The website you can\nlog onto is: http:/mospi.gov.in.  Employment\ndata is also available from other sources\nsuch as Census of India.\n     U UU UUNDERSTNDERSTNDERSTNDERSTNDERST ANDING ANDINGANDING ANDINGANDING  E  E E  E ECONOMICCONOMICCONOMICCONOMICCONOMIC  D  D D  D DEVEL EVELEVEL EVELEVEL OPMENT OPMENTOPMENT OPMENTOPMENT 18 1818 1818\nReprint 2025-26\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSECTORS\nOF THE INDIAN ECONOMYCHAPTER 2\nSECTORS OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES\nLet us look at these pictures. Y ou will find that people are\nengaged in various economic activities. Some of these are\nactivities producing goods. Some others are producing\nservices. These activities are happening around us every\nminute even as we speak.  How do we understand these\nactivities? One way of doing this is to group them (classify\nthem) using some important criterion. These groups are also\ncalled sectors.\nReprint 2025-26\nReprint 2025-26\n\n     U UUUUNDERSTNDERSTNDERST NDERSTNDERST ANDING ANDINGANDING ANDINGANDING  E  E E  E ECONOMICCONOMICCONOMICCONOMICCONOMIC  D  D D  D DEVEL EVELEVEL EVELEVEL OPMENT OPMENTOPMENT OPMENTOPMENT 20 2020 2020There are many activities that are\nundertaken by directly using\nnatural resources. Take, for\nexample, the cultivation of cotton. It\ntakes place within a crop season. For\nthe growth of the cotton plant, we\ndepend mainly, but not entirely,\non natural factors like rainfall,\nsunshine and climate. The product\nof this activity, cotton, is a natural\nproduct. Similarly, in the case of an\nactivity like dairy, we are dependent\non the biological process of\nthe animals and availability\nof fodder etc. The product\nhere, milk, also is a natural\nproduct. Similarly , minerals\nand ores are also natural\nproducts. When we produce\na good by exploiting natural\nresources, it is an activity of\nthe primary sector . Why\nprimary? This is because it\nforms the base for all\nother products that we\nsubsequently make. Since\nmost of the natural\nproducts we get are from\nagriculture, dairy, fishing,\nforestry, this sector is also\ncalled agriculture and related\nsector .\nThe secondary sector  covers\nactivities in which natural  products\nare changed into other forms through\nways of manufacturing that we\nassociate with industrial activity. It is\nthe next step after primary. The\nproduct is not produced by nature\nbut has to be made and therefore\nsome process of manufacturing is\nessential. This could be in a factory, a\nworkshop or at home.  For example,\nusing cotton fibre from the plant, wespin yarn and weave cloth. Using\nsugarcane as a raw material, we make\nsugar or gur. We convert earth into\nbricks and use bricks to make houses\nand buildings. Since this sector\ngradually became associated with the\ndifferent kinds of industries that came\nup, it is also called as industrial sector .\nAfter primary and secondary, there\nis a third category of activities that falls\nunder tertiary sector  and is different\nfrom the above two. These are\nactivities that help in the development\nof the primary and secondary sectors.\nThese activities, by themselves, do not\nproduce a good but they are an aid\nor a support for the production\nprocess. For example, goods that are\nproduced in the primary or secondary\nsector would need to be transported\nby trucks or trains and then sold in\nwholesale and retail shops. At times,\nit may be necessary to store these in\ngodowns. W e also may need to talk to\nothers over telephone or send letters\n(communication) or borrow money\nfrom banks (banking) to help\nproduction and trade. T ransport,\nstorage, communication, banking,\ntrade are some examples of tertiary\nactivities. Since these activities\ngenerate services rather than goods,\nthe tertiary sector is also called the\nservice sector .\nService sector also includes some\nessential services that may not directly\nhelp in the production of goods. For\nexample, we require teachers, doctors,\nand those who provide personal\nservices such as washermen, barbers,\ncobblers, lawyers, and people to do\nadministrative and accounting works.\nIn recent times, certain new services\nbased on information technology such\nas internet cafe, ATM booths, call\ncentres, software companies etc have\nbecome important.\nTertiar y\n(Service)\nSectorPrimary\n(Agriculture )\nSector\nSecondary\n(Industrial)\nSectorproduces\nnatural\ngoods\nproduces\nmanufactured\ngoodshelps to develop\nother sectors\nWe begin by looking at different\nkind of economic activities.\nReprint 2025-26\nReprint 2025-26\n\nS SS SSECTORS ECTORSECTORSECTORSECTORS      OF OFOF OFOF     THE THETHE THETHE I  I I  I INDIAN NDIANNDIAN NDIANNDIAN  E  E E  E ECONOMYCONOMYCONOMYCONOMYCONOMY 21 2121 2121EXAMPLE\nImagine what would happen if farmers\nrefuse to sell sugarcane to a particular\nsugar mill.

Let us look at some examples.\nReprint 2025-26\nReprint 2025-26\n\n     U UU UUNDERSTNDERSTNDERSTNDERSTNDERST ANDING ANDINGANDING ANDINGANDING  E  E E  E ECONOMICCONOMICCONOMICCONOMICCONOMIC  D  D D  D DEVEL EVELEVEL EVELEVEL OPMENT OPMENTOPMENT OPMENTOPMENT 22 2222 2222\nThe various production activities in the primary , secondary and\ntertiary sectors produce a very large number of goods and\nservices. A lso, the thre e sectors have a large number of people\nworking in them to produce these goods and services.  The next\nstep, therefore, is to see how much goods and services are\nproduced and how many people work in each sector . In an\neconomy there could be one or more sectors which are dominant\nin terms of total production and employment, while other sectors\nare relatively small in size.\nHow do we count the various goods and services\nand know the total production in each sector?\nWith so many thousands of goods and services produced, you\nmight think this is an impossible task! Not only would the task\nbe enormous, you might also wonder how we can add up cars\nand computers and nails and furniture. I t won’t make sense!!!\nYou are right in thinking so. T o get around this problem,\neconomists suggest that the values of goods and services should\nbe used rather than adding up the actual numbers. F or example,\nif 10,000 kgs of wheat is sold at Rs 20 per kg, the value of\nwheat will be Rs 2,00 ,000. The value of 5000 coconuts at Rs\n15 per coconut will be Rs 75,000 . Similarly , the value of go ods\nand services in the three sectors are calculated, and then added\nup.\nRemember , there is one precaution one has to take. N ot every\ngood (or service) that is produced and sold ne eds to be counted. I t\nmakes sense only to include the final goods and services . Take,\nfor instance, a farmer who sells wheat to a flour mill for Rs 20 per\nkg. The mill grinds the wheat and sells the flour to a biscuit\ncompany for Rs 25 per kg. The biscuit company uses the flour\nand things such as sugar and oil to make four packets of biscuits.\nIt sells biscuits in the market to the consumers for Rs 80 (Rs 20\nper packet). Biscuits are the final goods, i.e., goods that reach the\nconsumers.\nWhy are only ‘final goods and services’ counted?  In contrast\nto final goods, goods such as wheat and the wheat flour in this\nexample are intermediate goods.  Intermediate goods are used\nup in producing final goods and services. The value of final\ngoods already includes  the value of all the intermediate goods\nthat are used in making the final go od. H ence, the value of Rs\n80 for the biscuits (final good) already includes the value of\nflour (Rs 25). Similarly , the value of all other intermediate go ods\nwould have be en included. T o count the value of the flour and\nwheat separately is therefore not correct because then we would\nbe counting the value of the same things a number of times.\nFirst as wheat, then as flour and finally as biscuits.COMP ARING THE THREE SECTORS\n...BUT I SHOULD BE P AID THE\nFULL V ALUE OF THE WHEA T\nTHAT I PR ODUCE !\nReprint 2025-26\nReprint 2025-26\n\nS SS SSECTORS ECTORSECTORSECTORSECTORS      OF OFOF OFOF     THE THETHE THETHE I  I I  I INDIAN NDIANNDIAN NDIANNDIAN  E  E E  E ECONOMYCONOMYCONOMYCONOMYCONOMY 23 2323 2323The value of final goods and servicesThe value of final goods and servicesThe value of final goods and servicesThe value of final goods and servicesThe value of final goods and services\nproduced in each sector during aproduced in each sector during aproduced in each sector during aproduced in each sector during aproduced in each sector during a\nparticular year provides the totalparticular year provides the totalparticular year provides the totalparticular year provides the totalparticular year provides the total\nproduction of the sector for that year.production of the sector for that year.production of the sector for that year.production of the sector for that year.production of the sector for that year.\nAnd the sum of pr oduction in the different\nsectors gives what is called the Gross GrossGrossGrossGross\nDomestic PrDomestic PrDomestic PrDomestic PrDomestic Pr oduct (GDP) oduct (GDP) oduct (GDP) oduct (GDP) oduct (GDP) of a country.  It\nis the value of all final goods and services\nproduced within a countrywithin a countrywithin a countrywithin a countrywithin a country  during a\nparticular year . GDP shows how big the\neconomy is.\nIn India, the mammoth task of\nmeasuring GDP is undertaken by a central\ngover nment ministry. This Ministry, with\nthe help of various government\ndepartments of all the Indian states and\nunion territories, collects information\nrelating to total volume of goods and\nservices and their prices and then estimates\nthe GDP .\nRecently Indian Government began to\nbring out the contribution of three sectors\ntowar ds Gr oss V alue Added (GV A) in place\nof the contribution of three sectors towards\nGross Domestic Product to be at par with\nglobal practices. The GV A measur es the\ncontribution of three sectors of an\neconomy after adjusting for taxes and\nsubsidies. Y ou will lear n mor\ne about the\nGVA and the dif ference between GDP\nand GV A in higher classes. Her e we will\nonly understand how goods and services\nproduced in these three sectors —primary,\nsecondary and tertiary sectors\nhave changed.\nHistorical Change in Sectors\nGenerally, it has been noted fr om the\nhistories of many, now developed,\ncountries that at initial stages of\ndevelopment, primary sector was the most\nimportant sector of economic activity.\nAs the methods of far ming changed\nand agriculture sector began to pr osper ,\nit produced much more food than before.\nMany people could now take up other\nactivities. There were increasing number\nof craft-persons and traders. Buying and\nselling activities increased many times.Besides, there were also transporters,\nadministrators, ar my etc. However , at this\nstage, most of the goods produced were\nnatural products from the primary sector\nand most people were also employed in\nthis sector .\nOver a long time (mor e than hundr ed\nyears), and especially because new methods\nof manufacturing were introduced,\nfactories came up and started expanding.\nThose people who had earlier worked on\nfarms now began to work in factories in\nlarge numbers. They were forced to do so\nas you read in history chapters. People\nbegan to use many more goods that were\nproduced in factories at cheap rates.\nSecondary sector gradually became the\nmost important in total production and\nemployment. Hence, over time, a shift had\ntaken place. This means that the importance\nof the sectors had changed.\nIn the past 100 years, there has been a\nfurther shift from secondary to tertiary\nsector in developed countries.  The service\nsector has become the most important in\nterms of total pr oduction. Most of the\nworking people are also employed in the\nservice sector . This is the general patter n\nobserved in developed countries.\nWhat is the total production and\nemployment in the three sectors in India?\nOver the years have ther e been changes\nsimilar to the pattern observed for the\ndeveloped countries? W e shall see in the\nnext section.\n1.What does the history of developed countries indicate\nabout the shifts that have taken place between sectors?\n2.Correct and arrange the important aspects for calculating\nGDP from this Jumble.\nTo count goods and services we add the numbers that\nare produced. We count all those that were produced in\nthe last five years. Since we shouldn’t leave out anything\nwe add up all these goods and services.\n3.Discuss with your teacher how you could calculate the\ntotal value of a good or service by using the method of\nvalue added at each stage.LET’S WORK THESE OUT\nReprint 2025-26\nReprint 2025-26\n\n     U UU UUNDERSTNDERSTNDERSTNDERSTNDERST ANDING ANDINGANDING ANDINGANDING  E  E E  E ECONOMICCONOMICCONOMICCONOMICCONOMIC  D  D D  D DEVEL EVELEVEL EVELEVEL OPMENT OPMENTOPMENT OPMENTOPMENT 24 2424 2424Graph 1 shows the\nproduction of goods and\nservices in the three sectors.\nThis is shown for two years,\n1977 –78 and 2017 –18.

There could be\nseveral reasons.\nFirst, in any country several\nservices such as hospitals,\neducational institutions, post and\ntelegraph services, police stations,\ncourts, village administrative offices,\nmunicipal corporations, defence,\ntransport, banks, insurance\ncompanies, etc. are required. These\ncan be considered as basic services .\nIn a developing country the\ngovernment has to take responsibility\nfor the provision of these services.\nSecond, the development of\nagriculture and industry leads to the\ndevelopment of services such asGraph 1: GV A by Primary , Secondary and\nTertiary Sectors\nWhat does the comparison between\n1977–78 and 2017–18 show?\nWhat conclusions can we draw\nfrom the comparison?\nLet’s find out.14000000\n12000000\n10000000\n8000000\n6000000\n4000000\n2000000\n0\n1977-78 2017-18\nRs. in crores\nReprint 2025-26\nReprint 2025-26\n\nS SS SSECTORS ECTORSECTORS ECTORSECTORS      OF OFOF OFOF     THE THETHE THETHE I  I I  I INDIAN NDIANNDIAN NDIANNDIAN  E  E E  E ECONOMYCONOMYCONOMYCONOMYCONOMY 25 2525 2525transport, trade, storage and the\nlike, as we have already se en. G reater\nthe development of the primary and\nsecondary sectors, more would be the\ndemand for such services.\nThird, as income levels rise, certain\nsections of people start demanding\nmany more services like eating out,\ntourism, shopping, private hospitals,\nprivate schools, professional training\netc. Y ou can se e this change quite\nsharply in cities, especially in big cities.\nFourth, over the past decade or so,\ncertain new services such as\nthose based on information and\ncommunication technology have\nbecome important and essential. The\nproduction of these services has been\nrising rapidly.  In Chapter 4, we shall\nsee examples of these new services\nand the reasons for their expansion.\nHowever , you must remember that\nnot all of the service sector is growing\nequally well. Service sector in India\nemploys many dif ferent kinds of\npeople. At one end there are a limited\nnumber of services that employ highly\nskilled and educated workers. At the\nother end, there are a very large\nnumber of workers engaged in\nservices such as small shopkeepers,\nrepair persons, transport persons,\netc. These people barely manage to\nearn a living and yet they perform\nthese services because no alternative\nopportunities for work are available\nto them. Hence, only a part of this\nsector is growing in importance. You\nshall read more about this in the next\nsection.\nWhere are most of the people\nemployed?\nGraph 2 presents percentage share of\nthe thre e sectors in G VA. Now you can\ndirectly see the changing importance\nof the sectors over the forty years.Graph 2: Share of Sectors in GV A\nA remarkable fact about India is\nthat while there has been a change\nin the share of the three sector s in\nGVA, a similar shift has not taken\nplace in employment. Graph 3\nshows the share of employment in\nthe thre e sectors in 197 7-78 and\n2017-18 . The primary sector\ncontinues to be the largest\nemployer even now.\nWhy didn’t a similar shift out\nof primary sector happen in case\nof employment? I t is because not\nenough jobs were created in the\nsecondary and tertiary sector s.

The\nsame applies to the tertiary sector\nas well. While production in the\nservice sector rose by 1 4 times,\nemployment in the service sector\nrose around five times.\nAs a result, more than half of the\nworkers in the country are working\nin the primary sector , mainly in\nagriculture, producing only about\none sixth of the G VA. In contrast to\nthis, the secondary and tertiary\nsectors produce the rest of the\nproduce whereas they employ less\nabout half the people. Does this mean\nthat the workers in agriculture\nare not producing as much as\nthey could?\nWhat it means is that there\nare more people in agriculture than\nis necessary. So, even if you move\na few people out, production will\nnot be affected. In other words,\nworkers in the agricultural sector are\nunderemployed .\nFor instance, take the case of a\nsmall farmer , Laxmi, owning about\ntwo hectares of unirrigated land\ndependent only on rain and\ngrowing crops , like jowar  and arhar.\nAll five members of her family work\nin the plot throughout the year .\nWhy? They have nowhere else to go\nfor work. Y ou will se e that everyone\nis working, none remains idle, but\nin actual fact , their labour effort\ngets divided. Each one is doing\nsome work but no one is fully\nemployed. This is the situation of\nunderemployment, where people\nare apparently working but all\nof them are made to work less\nthan their potential. This kind ofunderemployment is hidden in\ncontrast to someone who does not\nhave a job and is clearly visible as\nunemployed. Hence, it is also\ncalled disguised unemployment.\nNow, supposing a landlord,\nSukhram, comes and hires one or\ntwo members of the family to work\non his land. Laxmi’s family is now\nable to earn some extra income\nthrough wages. Since you do  not\nneed five people to look after that\nsmall plot, two people moving out\ndoes not affect production on their\nfarm. In the above example, two\npeople may move to work in a\nfactory. Once again the earnings of\nthe family would increase and they\nwould also continue to produce as\nmuch from their land.\nThere are lakhs of farmers like\nLaxmi  in India. This means that even\nif we remove a lot of people from\nagricultural sector and provide them\nwith proper work elsewhere,\nagricultural production will not\nsuffer. The incomes of the people who\ntake up other work would increase\nthe total family income.\nThis underemployment can also\nhappen in other sectors. For\nexample there are thousands of\ncasual workers in the service\nsector in urban areas who search\nfor daily employment. They are\nemployed as painters, plumbers,\nrepair persons and others doing\nodd jobs. Many of them don’t find\nwork everyday. Similarly , we see\nother people of the service sector\non the street pushing a cart or\nselling something where they may\nspend the whole day but earn\nvery little.  They are doing this\nwork because they do not have\nbetter opportunities.\nReprint 2025-26\nReprint 2025-26\n\nS SS SSECTORS ECTORSECTORS ECTORSECTORS      OF OFOF OFOF     THE THETHE THETHE I  I I  I INDIAN NDIANNDIAN NDIANNDIAN  E  E E  E ECONOMYCONOMYCONOMYCONOMYCONOMY 27 2727 2727How to Create More\nEmployment?\nFrom the above discussion , we can see\nthat there continues to be considerable\nunderemployment in agriculture.\nThere are also people who are not\nemployed at all. In what ways can one\nincrease employment for people? Let\nus look at some of them.\nTake the case of Laxmi with her\ntwo-hectare plot of unirrigated land.\nThe government can spend some\nmoney or banks can provide a loan,\nto construct a well for her family to\nirrigate the land. Laxmi will then be\nable to irrigate her land and take a\nsecond crop, wheat, during the rabi\nseason. Let us suppose that one\nhectare of wheat can provide\nemployment to two people for 50 days\n(including sowing, watering, fertiliserLET’S WORK THESE OUT\nTABLE 2.2 SHARE OF PRIMAR Y SECT OR IN\nGDP  AND EMPLOYMENT\nShare in Gross V alue Added (GV A)\nShare in employment1.Complete the table using the data given in Graphs 2 and 3 and answer the question\nthat follows.

So, two\nmore members of the family can be\nemployed in her own field. Now\nsuppose a new dam is constructed\nand canals are dug to irrigate many\nsuch farms. This could lead to a lot of\nemployment generation within the\nagricultural sector itself reducing the\nproblem of underemployment.\nNow, suppose Laxmi and other\nfarmers produce much more than\nbefore. They would also need to sell some\nof this. For this they may be required to\ntransport their products to a nearby\ntown. If the government invests some\nmoney in transportation and storage of\ncrops, or makes better rural roads so\nthat mini-trucks reach everywhere\nseveral farmers like Laxmi, who now\nhave access to water, can continue to\ngrow and sell these crops. This activity\ncan provide productive employment to\nnot just farmers but also others such as\nthose in services like transport or trade.\nLaxmi’s need is not confined to\nwater alone. To cultivate the land, she\nalso needs seeds, fertilisers,\nagricultural equipment and pumpsets\nto draw water . Being a poor far mer,\nshe cannot afford many of these. So ,\nshe will have to borrow money from\nmoneylenders and pay a high rate ofinterest. If the local bank gives her\ncredit at a reasonable rate of interest,\nshe will be able to buy all these in time\nand cultivate her land. This means that\nalong with water , we also need to\nprovide cheap agricultural credit to the\nfarmers for far ming to impr ove. W e will\nlook at some of these needs in Chapter\n3, Money and Credit .\nAnother way by which we can\ntackle this problem is to identify,\npromote and locate industries and\nservices in semi-rural areas where a\nlarge number of people may be\nemployed. For instance, suppose\nmany farmers decide to grow arhar\nand chickpea (pulse crops). Setting\nup a dal mill to procure and process\nthese and sell in the cities is one such\nexample. Opening a cold storage could\ngive an opportunity for farmers to\nstore their products like potatoes and\nonions and sell them when the price\nis good. In villages near forest areas,\nwe can start honey collection centres\nwhere farmers can come and sell wild\nhoney. It is also possible to set up\nindustries that process vegetables and\nagricultural produce like potato,\nsweet potato, rice, wheat, tomato,\nfruits, which can be sold in outside\nmarkets. This will provide\nemployment in industries located in\nsemi-rural areas and not necessarily\nin large urban centres.\nDo you know that in India about\n60 per cent of the population belongs\nto the age group 5-29 years? Out of\nthis, only about 51 per cent are\nattending educational institutions.\nThe rest and particularly those aged\nless than 18 years may be at home or\nWhat groups of people do\nyou think are unemployed\nor underemployed in your\narea?

It is\ncalled Mahatma Gandhi National\nRural Employment Guarantee Act\n2005 (MGNREGA 2005 ). Under\nMGNREGA 2005, all those who are\nable to, and are in need of, work in\nrural areas are guaranteed 100 days\nof employment in a year by the\ngovernment. If the government fails in\nits duty to provide employment, it will\ngive unemployment allowances to the\npeople. The types of work that would\nin future help to increase the\nproduction from land  will be given\npreference u nder the Act.many of them may be working as\nchild labourers.  If these children are\nto attend schools, we will require more\nbuildings, more teachers and other\nstaff. A study conducted by the\nerstwhile Planning Commission  (now\nknown as NITI Aayog) estimates that\nnearly 20 lakh jobs can be created in\nthe education sector alone. Similarly,\nif we are to improve the health\nsituation, we need many more doctors,\nnurses, health workers etc. to work\nin rural areas. These are some ways\nby which jobs would be created and\nwe would also be able to address the\nimportant aspects of development\ntalked about in Chapter 1.\nEvery state or region has potential\nfor increasing the income and\nemployment for people in that area.\nIt could be tourism, or regional craft\nindustry, or new services like IT. Some\nof these would require proper\nplanning and support from the\ngovernment. For example, the same\nstudy by the Planning Commission\nsays that if tourism as a sector is\nimproved, every year we can give\nadditional employment to more than\n35 lakh people.\nWe must r ealise that some of the\nsuggestions discussed above would\ntake a long time to implement. For the\nshort-term, we need some quick\nmeasures. Recognising this, the\ncentral government in India made a\nlaw implementing the  Right to W ork\n1.

But the\nemployment opportunities in the\norganised sector have been expanding\nvery slowly. It is also common to find\nmany organised sector enterprises in\nthe unorganised sector . They adopt\nsuch strategies to evade taxes and\nrefuse to follow laws that protect\nlabourers. As a result, a large number\nof workers are forced to enter the\nunorganised sector jobs, which pay a\nvery low salary. They are often\nexploited and not paid a fair wage.\nTheir earnings are low and not\nregular . These jobs ar e not secur e and\nhave no other benefits.\nSince the 1990s, it is also common\nto see a large number of workers\nlosing their jobs in the organised\nsector . These workers ar e forced to\ntake up jobs in the unorganised\nsector with low earnings. Hence,\nbesides the need for more work, there\nis also a need for protection and\nsupport of the workers in the\nunorganised sector .Who are these vulnerable people\nwho need protection? In the rural\nareas, the unorganised sector mostly\ncomprises of landless agricultural\nlabourers, small and marginal\nfarmers, sharecroppers and artisans\n(such as weavers, blacksmiths,\ncarpenters and goldsmiths). Nearly\n80 per cent of rural households in\nIndia are in small and marginal\nfarmer category. These farmers need\nto be supported through adequate\nfacility for timely delivery of seeds,\nagricultural inputs, credit, storage\nfacilities and marketing outlets.\nIn the urban areas, unorganised\nsector comprises mainly of workers in\nsmall-scale industry, casual workers\nin construction, trade and transport\netc., and those who work as street\nvendors, head load workers, garment\nmakers, rag pickers etc. Small-scale\nindustry also needs government’s\nsupport for procuring raw material\nand marketing of output. The casual\nworkers in both rural and urban\nareas need to be protected.\nWe also find that majority of\nworkers from scheduled castes, tribes\nand backward communities\nfind themselves in the\nunorganised sector . Besides\ngetting the irregular and low\npaid work, these workers also\nface social discrimination.\nProtection and support to\nthe unorganised sector\nworkers is thus necessary\nfor both economic and\nsocial development.\nWhen factories close down, many\nonce regular workers are found\nselling goods or pushing a cart or\ndoing some other odd job\nReprint 2025-26\nReprint 2025-26\n\nS SS SSECTORS ECTORSECTORSECTORSECTORS      OF OFOF OFOF     THE THETHE THETHE I  I I  I INDIAN NDIANNDIAN NDIANNDIAN  E  E E  E ECONOMYCONOMYCONOMYCONOMYCONOMY 33 3333 3333Sector Criteria used Most important Problems indicated and\nconclusion how they can be tackled\nPrimary , Nature\nSecondary , of activity\nTertiary\nOrganised,\nUnorganisedLET’S RECALL\nWith so many activities taking place around us, one needs to use the\nprocess of classification to think in a useful manner . The criterion for\nclassification could be many depending on what we desire to find out.\nThe process of classification helps to analyse a situation.\nIn dividing the economic activities into three sectors — primary,\nsecondary, tertiary — the criterion used was the ‘nature of activity’. On\nthe basis of this classification, we were able to analyse the pattern of total\nproduction and employment in India. Similarly, we divided the economic\nactivities into organised and unorganised and used the classification to\nlook at employment in the two sectors.\nWhat was the most important conclusion that was derived from the\nclassification exercises? What were the problems and solutions that were\nindicated? Can you summarise the information in the following table?\nTABLE 2.4 CLASSIFYING ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES\nAnother way of classifying economic\nactivities into sectors could be on the\nbasis of who owns assets and is\nresponsible for the delivery of services.\nIn the public  sector , the gover nment\nowns most of the assets and provides\nall the services. In the private  sector ,\nownership of assets and delivery of\nservices is in the hands of private\nindividuals or companies. Railways or\npost office is an example of the public\nsector whereas companies like Tata\nIron and Steel Company Limited\n(TISCO) or Reliance Industries\nLimited (RIL) are privately owned.\nActivities in the private sector are\nguided by the motive to earn profits.To get such services we have to pay\nmoney to these individuals and\ncompanies. The purpose of the public\nsector is not just to earn profits.\nGovernments raise money through\ntaxes and other ways to meet expenses\non the services rendered by it. Modern\nday governments spend on a whole\nrange of activities. What are these\nactivities? Why do governments spend\non such activities? Let’s find out.\nThere are several things needed by\nthe society as a whole but which the\nprivate sector  will not provide at\na reasonable cost.  Why? Some of\nthese need spending large sums of\nmoney, which is beyond the capacitySECTORS IN TERMS OF OWNERSHIP: PUBLIC\nAND PRIV ATE SECTORS\nReprint 2025-26\nReprint 2025-26\n\n     U UU UUNDERSTNDERSTNDERSTNDERSTNDERST ANDING ANDINGANDING ANDINGANDING  E  E E  E ECONOMICCONOMICCONOMICCONOMICCONOMIC  D  D D  D DEVEL EVELEVEL EVELEVEL OPMENT OPMENTOPMENT OPMENTOPMENT 34 3434 3434of the private sector . Also, collecting\nmoney from thousands of people who\nuse these facilities is not easy . Even\nif they do provide these things they\nwould charge a high rate for their\nuse. Examples are construction of\nroads, bridges, railways, harbours,\ngenerating electricity, providing\nirrigation through dams etc.  Thus,\ngovernments have to undertake such\nheavy  spending and ensure that\nthese facilities are available for\neveryone.\nThere are some activities, which\nthe government has to support . The\nprivate sector may not continue their\nproduction or business unless\ngovernment encourages it. For\nexample, selling electricity at the cost\nof generation may push up the costs\nof production of goods in many\nindustries. Many units, especially\nsmall-scale units, might have to shut\ndown. Government here steps in by\nproducing and supplying electricity\nat rates which these industries can\nafford. Government has to bear part\nof the cost.\nSimilarly , the Government in I ndia\nbuys wheat and rice from farmers at\na ‘fair price’. This it stores in its\ngodowns and sells at a lower price to\nconsumers through ration shops. Y ou\nhave read about this in the chapter\non Food Security in C lass I X. Thegovernment has to bear some of the\ncost. I n this way , the government\nsupports both farmers and\nconsumers.\nThere are a large number of\nactivities which are the primary\nresponsibility of the government. The\ngovernment must spend on these.\nProviding health and education\nfacilities for all is one example. W e have\ndiscussed some of these issues in the\nfirst chapter . Running proper scho ols\nand providing quality education,\nparticularly elementary education, is\nthe duty of the government. I ndia’s size\nof illiterate population is one of the\nlargest in the world.\nSimilarly , we know that nearly half\nof India’s children are malnourished\nand a quarter of them are critically\nill. W e have read about I nfant\nMortality Rates. The infant mortality\nrate of Odisha (36) or Madhya\nPradesh (43) is higher than some of\nthe poorest regions of the world.\nGovernment also needs to pay\nattention to aspects of human\ndevelopment such as availability of\nsafe drinking water , housing facilities\nfor the poor and food and nutrition.\nIt is also the duty of the government\nto take care of the poorest and most\nignored regions of the country through\nincreased spending in such areas.\nSUMMING UP\nIn this chapter we have looke d at ways of\nclassifying economic activities into some\nmeaningful groups. One way of doing this\nis to examine whether the activity relates to\nthe primary , secondary or tertiary sectors.\nThe data for India, for the last thirty years,\nshows that while  goods and services\nproduced in the tertiary sector contribute\nthe most to G DP, the employment remains\nin the primary sector . We have also se enwhat all can be done for increasing\nemployment opportunities in the country .\nAnother classification is to consider whether\npeople are working in organised or\nunorganised sectors. M ost people are\nworking in the unorganised sectors and\nprotection is necessary for them. W e also\nlooked at the dif ference betwe en private and\npublic activities, and why it is important\nfor public activities to focus on certain areas .\nReprint 2025-26\nReprint 2025-26\n\n1.Fill in the blanks using the correct option given in the bracket:\n(i)Employment in the service sector _________  increased to the same extent\nas production.
