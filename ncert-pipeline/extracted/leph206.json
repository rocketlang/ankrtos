Image is real and at 7.5  cm from the lens on its right\nside.\n(b)f = –16  cm. Image is real and at 48  cm from the lens on its right side.\n9.9 v = 8.4  cm, image is erect and virtual. It is diminished to a size\n1.8 \ncm. As u ® ¥, v ® f (but never beyond f while m ® 0).\nNote that when the object is placed at the focus of the concave lens\n(21 cm), the image is located at 10.5  cm (not at infinity as one might\nwrongly think).\n9.10 A  diverging lens of focal length 60  cm\n9.11 (a)ve = –25  cm and  fe = 6.25 cm give ue = –5 cm; vO = (15 – 5)  cm =\n10 cm,\nfO = uO = – 2.5  cm; Magnifying power = 20\n(b)uO = – 2.59  cm.\nMagnifying power = 13.5.\n9.12 Angular magnification of the eye-piece for image at 25  cm\n  25\n251 11\n.; | | .25cm 2 27cm11eu= = ; vO = 7.2  cm\nSeparation = 9.47  cm; Magnifying power = 88\n9.13 24; 150  cm\n9.14 (a)Angular magnification = 1500\n(b)Diameter of the image  = 13.7  cm.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n347Answers\n9.15 Apply mirror equation and the condition:\n(a)f < 0 (concave mirror);  u < 0 (object on left)\n(b)f > 0; u < 0\n(c)f > 0 (convex mirror) and u < 0\n(d)f < 0 (concave mirror); f < u < 0\nto deduce the desired result.\n9.16 The pin appears raised by 5.0  cm. It can be seen with an explicit ray\ndiagram that the answer is independent of the location of the slab\n(for small angles of incidence).\n9.17 (a)sin i¢c = 1.44/1.68 which gives  i¢c  = 59°. Total internal reflection\ntakes place  when \ni > 59° or when r < rmax = 31°. Now ,\n(sin /sin ) .max maxi r =1 68, which gives imax  ~  60°. Thus , all\nincident rays of angles in the range 0 < i < 60° will suffer total\ninternal reflections in the pipe. (If the length of the pipe is\nfinite, which it is in practice, there will be a lower limit on i\ndetermined by the ratio of the diameter to the length of the\npipe.)\n(b)If there is no outer coating, i¢c = sin–1(1/1.68) = 36.5° . Now,\ni = 90° will have r = 36.5°  and  i¢ = 53.5° which is greater than\ni¢c. Thus, all incident rays (in the range 53.5°  < i < 90°) will\nsuffer total internal reflections.\n9.18 For fixed distance s between object and screen, the lens equation\ndoes not give a real solution for u or v if f is greater than s/4.\nTherefore,  fmax = 0.75  m.\n9.19 21.4 cm\n9.20 (a)(i)Let a parallel beam be the incident from the left on the convex\nlens first.\nf1 = 30  cm and u1 = – , give  v1 = + 30  cm. This image becomes\na virtual object for the second lens.\nf2 = –20  cm, u2 = + (30 – 8)  cm = + 22 cm which gives,\nv2 = – 220  cm. The parallel incident beam appears to diverge\nfrom a point 216  cm from the centre of the two-lens system .\n(ii)Let the parallel beam be incident from the left on the concave\nlens  first:  f1 = – 20  cm, u1 = – ¥, give v1 = – 20  cm. This image\nbecomes a real object for the second lens: f2 = + 30  cm, u2 =\n– (20 + 8)  cm = – 28  cm which gives, v2 = – 420  cm. The parallel\nincident beam appears to diverge from a point 416 cm on the\nleft of the centre of the two-lens system.\nClearly, the answer depends on which side of the lens system\nthe parallel beam is incident. Further we do not have a simple lens\nequation true for all u (and v) in terms of a definite constant of the\nsystem  (the constant being determined by f1 and f2, and the separation\nbetween the lenses). T he notion of effective focal length, therefore,\ndoes not seem to be meaningful for this system.\n(b)u1 = – 40  cm, f1 = 30  cm, gives v1= 120 cm.\nMagnitude of magnification due to the first (convex) lens is 3.\nu2= + (120 – 8)  cm = +112  cm (object virtual);\nf2 = – 20 cm which gives v2112 20\n92= −×cm\nMagnitude of magnification due to the second (concave)\nReprint 2025-26\n\n348Physics\nlens = 20/92.\nNet magnitude of magnification = 0.652\nSize of the image = 0.98  cm\n9.21 If the refracted ray in the prism is incident on the second face at the\ncritical angle ic, the angle of refraction r at the first face is (60°– ic).\nNow, ic = sin–1 (1/1.524) ~ 41°\nTherefore, r = 19°\nsin i =  0.4962; i  ~ 30°\n9.22 (a)1 1\n91\n10 v+ =\ni.e., v = – 90  cm,\nMagnitude of magnification = 90/9 = 10.\nEach square in the virtual image  has an area 10 × 10 × 1  mm2\n= 100  mm2 = 1 cm2\n(b)Magnifying power = 25/9 = 2.8\n(c)No, magnification of an image by a lens and angular magnification\n(or magnifying power) of an optical instrument are two separate\nthings. The latter is the ratio of the angular size of the object\n(which is equal to the angular size of the image even if the image\nis magnified) to the angular size of the object if placed at the near\npoint (25  cm). Thus, magnification magnitude is |( v\n/u)| and\nmagnifying power is (25/ | u|). Only when the image is located at\nthe near point | v| = 25  cm, are the two quantities equal.\n9.23 (a)Maximum magnifying power is obtained when the image is at\nthe near point (25  cm)\nu =  – 7.14  cm.\n(b)Magnitude of magnification = (25/ | u|) = 3.5.\n(c)Magnifying power  = 3.5\nYes, the magnifying power (when the image is pr oduced at 25  cm)\nis equal to the magnitude of magnification.\n9.24 Magnification  = ( . / ) 6 25 1  = 2.5\n            v = +2.5 u\n       1\n2511\n10 .uu\ni.e.,u = – 6  cm\n|v| = 15  cm\nThe virtual image is closer than the normal  near point (25  cm) and\ncannot be seen by the eye distinctly.\n9.25 (a)Even though the absolute image size is bigger than the object\nsize, the angular size of the image is equal to the angular size of\nthe object. The magnifier helps in the following way: without it\nobject would be placed no closer than 25  \ncm;  with it the object\ncan be placed much closer . The closer object has lar ger angular\nsize than the same object at 25  cm. It is in this sense that angular\nmagnification is achieved.\n(b)Yes, it decr eases a little because the angle subtended at the eye\nis then slightly less than the angle subtended at the lens. The\nReprint 2025-26\n\n349Answers\neffect is negligible if the image is at a very large distance away.\n[Note:  When the eye is separated from the lens , the angles\nsubtended at the eye by the first object and its image are not\nequal.]\n(c)First, grinding lens of very small focal length is not easy. More\nimportant, if you decrease focal length, aberrations (both spherical\nand chromati c) become more pronounced. So, in practice, you\ncannot  get a magnifying power of more than 3 or so with a simple\nconvex lens. However , using an aberration corr ected lens system,\none can increase this limit by a factor of 10 or so.\n(d)Angular magnification of eye-piece is [ (25/fe) + 1] (fe in cm) which\nincr\neases if fe is smaller . Further , magnification of the objective\nis given by   O\nO O O1\n| | (| |/ ) 1v\nu u f=\n−\nwhich is large when  O| |u is slightly greater than fO. The micro-\nscope is used for viewing very close object. So O| |u is small, and\nso is fO.\n(e)The image of the objective in the eye-piece is known as ‘ey e-ring’.\nAll the rays from the object refracted by objective go through the\neye-ring. Therefore, it is an ideal position for our eyes for viewing.\nIf we place our eyes too close to the eye-piece , we shall not collect\nmuch of the light and also reduce our field of view. If we position\nour eyes on the eye-ring and the area of the pupil of our eye is\ngreater or equal to the area of the eye-ring, our eyes will collect\nall the light refracted by the objective. The precise location of\nthe eye-ring naturally depends on the separation between the\nobjective and the eye-piece. When you view through a microscope\nby placing your eyes on one end,the ideal distance between the\neyes and eye-piece is usually built-in the design of the\ninstrument.\n9.26 Assume microscope in normal use i.e., image at 25  cm.

The\nseparation between the objective and the eye-piece should be (7.5 +\n4.17)  cm = 11.67  cm. Further the object should be placed 1.5  cm from\nthe objective to obtain the desired magnification.\n9.27 (a)m = (fO/fe) = 28\n(b)m = f\nff\neO O125+\n\n = 33.6\nReprint 2025-26\n\n350Physics\n9.28 (a)fO + fe = 145  cm\n(b)Angle subtended by the tower = (100/3000) = (1/30) rad .\nAngle subtended by the image produced by the objective\n=  \nO140h h\nf=\nEquating  the two, h  = 4.7  cm.\n            (c) Magnification (magnitude) of the eye-piece = 6.

Parallel rays coming fr om the object\nat infinity will focus at a distance of 110  mm fr om the lar\nger mirr or.\nThe distance of virtual object for the smaller mirror = (110 –20) =\n90 mm. The focal length of smaller mirror is 70  mm. Using the mirror\nformula, image is for med at 315  mm fr om the smaller mirr or.\n9.30 The reflected rays get deflected by twice the angle of rotation of the\nmirror. Ther efore, d/1.5 = tan 7°. Hence d = 18.4  cm.\n9.31 n = 1.33\n",
