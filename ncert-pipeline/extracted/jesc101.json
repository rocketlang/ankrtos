Write a balanced chemical equation with state symbols for the\nfollowing reactions.\n(i)Solutions of barium chloride and sodium sulphate in water react\nto give insoluble barium sulphate and the solution of sodium\nchloride.\n(ii)Sodium hydroxide solution (in water) reacts with hydrochloric\nacid solution (in water) to produce sodium chloride solution and\nwater .?\nReprint 2025-26\n\nChemical Reactions and Equations 7Let us discuss some more examples of combination reactions.\n(i)Burning of coal\nC(s) + O2(g)  → CO2(g) (1.15)\n(ii)Formation of water from H2(g) and O2(g)\n2H2(g) + O2(g) → 2H2O(l) (1.16)\nIn simple language we can say that when two or more substances\n(elements or compounds) combine to form a single product, the reactions\nare called combination reactions.\nIn Activity 1.4, we also observed that a large amount of heat is evolved.\nThis makes the reaction mixture warm. Reactions in which heat is\nreleased along with the formation of products are called exothermic\nchemical reactions.\nOther examples of exothermic reactions are –\n(i)Burning of natural gas\nCH4(g) + 2O2 (g) →  CO2 (g) + 2H2O (g) (1.17)\n(ii)Do you know that respiration is an exothermic process?\nWe all know that we need energy to stay alive. W e get this ener gy\nfrom the food we eat. During digestion, food is broken down into simpler\nsubstances. For example, rice, potatoes and bread contain\ncarbohydrates. These carbohydrates are broken down to form glucose.\nThis glucose combines with oxygen in the cells of our body and provides\nenergy. The special name of this reaction is respiration, the process of\nwhich you will study in Chapter 6.\nC6H12O6(aq) + 6O2(aq) → 6CO2(aq) + 6H2O(l) + energy (1.18)\n(Glucose)\n(iii) The decomposition of vegetable matter into compost is also an\nexample of an exothermic reaction.\nIdentify the type of the reaction taking place in Activity 1.1, where\nheat is given out along with the formation of a single product.\nDo Y ou Know?A solution of slaked lime produced by the reaction 1.13 is used for whitewashing\nwalls. Calcium hydroxide reacts slowly with the carbon dioxide in air to form a thin\nlayer of calcium carbonate on the walls. Calcium carbonate is  formed after two to\nthree days of whitewashing and gives a shiny finish to the walls. It is interesting to note\nthat the chemical formula for marble is also CaCO3.\nCa(OH)2(aq) + CO2(g) →CaCO3(s)  + H2O(l) (1.14)\n(Calcium (Calcium\nhydroxide) carbonate)\nReprint 2025-26\n\nScience 8 88 88Figure 1.5\nHeating of lead nitrate and\nemission of nitrogen dioxide\nFigure 1.4\nCorrect way of heating\nthe boiling tube\ncontaining crystals\nof ferrous sulphate\nand of smelling the\nodour\nActivity 1.6Activity 1.6Activity 1.6Activity 1.6Activity 1.6\nnTake about 2 g lead nitrate powder in a boiling\ntube.\nnHold the boiling tube with a pair of tongs and\nheat it over a flame, as shown in Fig. 1.5.\nnWhat do you observe?

You can also smell the characteristic odour of burning\nsulphur.\n2FeSO4(s) Heat →   Fe2O3(s)  +  SO2(g)  + SO3(g) (1.19)\n(Ferrous sulphate)   (Ferric oxide)\nIn this reaction you can observe that a single reactant breaks down\nto give simpler products. This is a decomposition reaction. Ferrous\nsulphate crystals (FeSO4. 7H2O) lose water when heated and the colour\nof the crystals changes. It then decomposes to ferric oxide (Fe2O3),\nsulphur dioxide (SO2) and sulphur trioxide (SO3). Ferric oxide is a solid,\nwhile SO2 and SO3 are gases.\nDecomposition of calcium carbonate to calcium oxide and carbon\ndioxide on heating is an important decomposition reaction used in\nvarious industries. Calcium oxide is called lime or quick lime. It has\nmany uses – one is in the manufacture of cement. When a decomposition\nreaction is carried out by heating, it is called thermal decomposition.\nCaCO3(s) Heat →   CaO(s)    +   CO2(g) (1.20)\n(Limestone)    (Quick lime)\nAnother example of a thermal decomposition reaction is given\nin Activity 1.6.1.2.2 Decomposition Reaction\nReprint 2025-26\n\nChemical Reactions and Equations 9 99 99Activity 1.7Activity 1.7Activity 1.7Activity 1.7Activity 1.7\nActivity 1.8Activity 1.8Activity 1.8Activity 1.8Activity 1.8\nnTake about 2 g silver chloride in a china dish.\nnWhat is its colour?\nnPlace this china dish in sunlight for some time\n(Fig. 1.7).\nnObserve the colour of the silver chloride after some\ntime.\nFigure 1.7\nSilver chloride turns grey\nin sunlight to form silver\nmetalYou will see that white silver chloride turns grey in sunlight.

Is this an exothermic or endothermic reaction?Carry out the following ActivitySilver bromide also behaves in the same way.\n2AgBr(s)Sunlight → 2Ag(s) + Br2(g) (1.23)\nThe above reactions are used in black and white photography.\nWhat form of energy is causing these decomposition reactions?\nWe have seen that the decomposition reactions require energy either\nin the form of heat, light or electricity for breaking down the reactants.\nReactions in which energy is absorbed are known as endothermic\nreactions.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nChemical Reactions and Equations 11Why does the iron nail become brownish in colour and the blue colour\nof copper sulphate solution fades?\nThe following chemical reaction takes place in this Activit y–\nFe(s) + CuSO4(aq) → FeSO4(aq)    +   Cu(s) (1.24)\n        (Copper sulphate) (Iron sulphate)\nIn this reaction, iron has displaced or removed another element,\ncopper , from copper sulphate solution. This r eaction is known as\ndisplacement reaction.\nOther examples of displacement reactions are\nZn(s) + CuSO4(aq)   → ZnSO4(aq)   +     Cu(s) (1.25)\n     (Copper sulphate) (Zinc sulphate)\nPb(s) + CuCl2(aq)   → PbCl2(aq)     +     Cu(s) (1.26)\n      (Copper chloride) (Lead chloride)\nZinc and lead ar e mor e reactive elements than copper .

This insoluble substance\nformed is known as a precipitate. Any reaction that\nproduces a precipitate can be called a precipitation reaction.\nNa2SO4(aq) + BaCl2(aq) → BaSO4(s) + 2NaCl(aq) (1.27)\n(Sodium (Barium (Barium (Sodium\nsulphate) chloride) sulphate) chloride)Figure 1.8 Figure 1.8 Figure 1.8 Figure 1.8 Figure 1.8 (b) Iron nails and copper sulphate solutions compared before and after the experiment\nReprint 2025-26\n\nScience 121.2.5 Oxidation and Reduction\nActivity 1.11Activity 1.11Activity 1.11Activity 1.11Activity 1.11\n/square6Heat a china dish containing about 1 g\ncopper powder (Fig. 1.10).\n/square6What do you observe?\nFigure 1.10Figure 1.10Figure 1.10Figure 1.10Figure 1.10\nOxidation of copper to\ncopper oxideThe surface of copper powder becomes coated with\nblack copper(II) oxide. Why has this black\nsubstance formed?\nThis is because oxygen is added to copper and\ncopper oxide is formed.\n2Cu + O2  Heat →  2CuO (1.28)\nIf hydrogen gas is passed over this heated material (CuO), the black\ncoating on the surface turns brown as the reverse reaction takes place\nand copper is obtained.\nCuO +H Cu+H O2 2Heat →  (1.29)\nIf a substance gains oxygen during a reaction, it is said to be oxidised.\nIf a substance loses oxygen during a reaction, it is said to be reduced.\nDuring this reaction (1.29), the copper(II) oxide is losing oxygen and\nis being reduced. The hydrogen is gaining oxygen and is being oxidised.\nIn other words, one reactant gets oxidised while the other gets reduced\nduring a reaction. Such reactions are called oxidation-reduction reactions\nor redox reactions.\n(1.30)\nSome other examples of redox reactions are:\nZnO + C → +Zn CO (1.31)\nMnO HCl MnCl H O Cl2 2 2 2 4 2+ → + + (1.32)Recall Activity 1.2Recall Activity 1.2Recall Activity 1.2Recall Activity 1.2Recall Activity 1.2 , where you have mixed the solutions of lead(II) nitrate\nand potassium iodide.\n(i)What was the colour of the precipitate formed? Can you name the compound\nprecipitated?\n(ii)Write the balanced chemical equation for this r eaction.\n(iii)Is this also a double displacement reaction?What causes this? The  white precipitate of BaSO4 is formed by the\nreaction of 2–\n4SO and Ba2+. The other product formed is sodium chloride\nwhich remains in the solution. Such reactions in which there is an\nexchange of ions between the reactants are called double displacement\nreactions.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nChemical Reactions and Equations 13In reaction (1.31) carbon is oxidised to CO and ZnO is reduced to Zn.\nIn reaction (1.32) HCl is oxidised to Cl2 whereas MnO2 is reduced to MnCl2.\nFrom the above examples we can say that if a substance gains oxygen\nor loses hydrogen during a reaction, it is oxidised. If a substance loses\noxygen or gains hydrogen during a reaction, it is reduced.\nQUESTIONS\n?1. Why does the colour of copper sulphate solution change when\nan iron nail is dipped in it?\n2.

This process\nis commonly known as rusting of iron. Some other metals also get\ntarnished in this manner . Have you noticed the colour of the coating\nformed on copper and silver? When a metal is attacked by substances\naround it such as moisture, acids, etc., it is said to corrode and this\nprocess is called corrosion. The black coating on silver and the green\ncoating on copper are other examples of corrosion.\nCorrosion causes damage to car bodies, bridges, iron railings, ships\nand to all objects made of metals, specially those of iron. Corrosion of\niron is a serious problem. Every year an enormous amount of money is\nspent to r eplace damaged ir on. You will lear n mor e about corr osion in\nChapter 3.\n1.3.2 Rancidity\nHave you ever tasted or smelt the fat/oil containing food materials left\nfor a long time?\nWhen fats and oils are oxidised, they become rancid and their smell\nand taste change. Usually substances which prevent oxidation\n(antioxidants) are added to foods containing fats and oil. Keeping food\nin air tight containers helps to slow down oxidation. Do you know that\nchips manufacturers usually flush bags of chips with gas such as\nnitrogen to prevent the chips from getting oxidised ?Recall Activity 1.1Recall Activity 1.1Recall Activity 1.1Recall Activity 1.1Recall Activity 1.1 ,     where a magnesium ribbon burns with a dazzling flame in air (oxygen)\nand changes into a white substance, magnesium oxide.

Equations must always be balanced.\n/square6In a combination reaction two or more substances combine to form a new single\nsubstance.\n/square6Decomposition reactions are opposite to combination reactions. In a decomposition\nreaction, a single substance decomposes to give two or more substances.\n/square6Reactions in which heat is given out along with the products are called exothermic\nreactions.\n/square6Reactions in which energy is absorbed are known as endothermic reactions.\n/square6When an element displaces another element from its compound, a displacement\nreaction occurs.\n/square6Two different atoms or groups of atoms (ions) are exchanged in double displacement\nreactions.\n/square6Precipitation reactions produce insoluble salts.\n/square6Reactions also involve the gain or loss of oxygen or hydrogen by substances.\nOxidation is the gain of oxygen or loss of hydrogen. Reduction is the loss of oxygen\nor gain of hydrogen.\nEXERCISES\n1.Which of the statements about the reaction below are incorrect?\n2PbO(s) + C(s) →  2Pb(s) + CO2(g)\n(a) Lead is getting reduced.\n(b) Carbon dioxide is getting oxidised.\n(c) Carbon is getting oxidised.\n(d) Lead oxide is getting reduced.\n(i)(a) and (b)\n(ii) (a) and (c)\n(iii) (a), (b) and (c)\n(iv) all\n2.Fe2O3 + 2Al → Al2O3 + 2Fe\nThe above reaction is an example of a\n(a) combination reaction.\n(b) double displacement reaction.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nChemical Reactions and Equations 15(c) decomposition reaction.\n(d) displacement reaction.\n3.What happens when dilute hydr ochloric acid is added to iron fillings?
