A = BA cos q (6.1)\nwhere q   is angle between B and A. The notion of the area as a vector\nhas been discussed earlier in Chapter 1. Equation (6.1) can be\nextended to curved surfaces and nonuniform fields.\nIf the magnetic field has different magnitudes and directions at\nvarious parts of a surface as shown in Fig. 6.5, then the magnetic\nflux through the surface is given by\n1 1 2 2d d Φ= + +B A B A. .B... = B A.i id\nall∑(6.2)\nwhere ‘all’ stands for summation over all the area elements dAi\ncomprising the surface and Bi is the magnetic field at the area element\ndAi. The SI unit of magnetic flux is weber (Wb) or tesla meter\nsquared (T m2). Magnetic flux is a scalar quantity.\n6.4  F ARADA Y’S LAW OF INDUCTION\nFrom the experimental observations, Faraday arrived at a\nconclusion that an emf  is induced in a coil when magnetic flux\nthrough the coil changes with time. Experimental observations\ndiscussed in Section 6.2 can be explained using this concept.\nThe motion of a magnet towards or away from coil C1 in\nExperiment 6.1 and moving a current-carrying coil C2 towards\nor away from coil C1 in Experiment 6.2, change the magnetic\nflux associated with coil C1.  The change in magnetic flux induces\nemf in coil C1. It was this induced emf which caused electric\ncurr\nent to flow in coil C1 and thr ough the galvanometer . A\nplausible explanation for the observations of Experiment 6.3 is\nas follows: When the tapping key K is pressed, the current in\ncoil C2 (and the resulting magnetic field) rises from zero to a\nmaximum value in a short time. Consequently, the magnetic\nflux through the neighbouring coil C1 also increases. It is the change in\nmagnetic flux through coil C1 that produces an induced emf in coil C1.\nWhen the key is held pressed, current in coil C2 is constant. Therefore,\nthere is no change in the magnetic flux through coil C1 and the current in\ncoil C1 drops to zero. When the key is released, the current in C2 and the\nresulting magnetic field decreases from the maximum value to zero in a\nshort time. This results in a decrease in magnetic flux through coil C1\nand hence again induces an electric current in coil C1*. The common\npoint in all these observations is that the time rate of change of magnetic\nflux through a circuit induces emf in it. Faraday stated experimental\nobservations in the form of a law called Faraday’s law of electromagnetic\ninduction . The law is stated below.FIGURE  6.4 A plane of\nsurface area A placed in a\nuniform magnetic field B.\nFIGURE  6.5 Magnetic field Bi\nat the ith area element. d Ai\nrepresents area vector of the\nith area element.\n*Note that sensitive electrical instruments in the vicinity of an electromagnet\ncan be damaged due to the induced emfs (and the resulting currents)  when the\nelectromagnet is turned on or off.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPhysics\n158\n EXAMPLE  6.1The magnitude of the induced emf in a circuit is equal\nto the time rate of change of magnetic flux through the\ncircuit.\nMathematically, the induced emf  is given by\nd–dB\ntΦε= (6.3)\nThe negative sign indicates the direction of e  and hence\nthe direction of current in a closed loop. This will be\ndiscussed in detail in the next section.\nIn the case of a closely wound coil of N turns, change\nof flux associated with each turn, is the same. Therefore,\nthe expression for the total induced emf is given by\nd–dBNtΦε= (6.4)\nThe induced emf can be increased by increasing the\nnumber of turns N of a closed coil.\nFrom Eqs. (6.1) and (6.2), we see that the flux can be\nvaried by changing any one or more of the terms B, A and\nq. In Experiments 6.1 and 6.2 in Section 6.2, the flux is\nchanged by varying B. The flux can also be altered by\nchanging the shape of a coil (that is, by shrinking it or\nstretching it) in a magnetic field, or rotating a coil in a\nmagnetic field such that the angle q  between B and A\nchanges. In these cases too, an emf is induced in the\nrespective coils.\nExample 6.1  Consider Experiment 6.2. (a) What would you do to obtain\na large deflection of the galvanometer? (b) How would you demonstrate\nthe presence of an induced current in the absence of a galvanometer?\nSolution\n(a)To obtain a large deflection , one or more of the following steps can\nbe taken:  (i) Use a rod made of soft iron  inside the coil C2, (ii) Connect\nthe coil to a powerful battery, and (iii) M ove the arrangement rapidly\ntowards the test coil  C1.\n(b)Replace the galvanometer by a small bulb, the kind one finds in a\nsmall torch  light. The relative motion between the two coils will cause\nthe bulb to glow and thus demonstrate the presence of an induced\ncurrent.\nIn experimental physics one must learn to innovate. Michael Faraday\nwho is ranked as one of the best experimentalists ever , was legendary\nfor his innovative skills.\nExample 6.2A square loop of side 10 cm and resistance 0.5 W is\nplaced vertically in the east-west  plane. A uniform magnetic field of\n0.10 T is set up across the plane in the north-east direction. The\nmagnetic field is decreased to zero in 0.70 s at a steady rate. Determine\nthe magnitudes of induced emf and current during this time-interval.Michael Faraday  [1791–\n1867] Faraday made\nnumerous contributions to\nscience, viz., the discovery\nof electromagnetic\ninduction, the laws of\nelectrolysis, benzene, and\nthe fact that the plane of\npolarisation is rotated in an\nelectric field. He is also\ncredited with the invention\nof the electric motor , the\nelectric generator and the\ntransfor mer. He is widely\nregarded as the greatest\nexperimental scientist of\nthe nineteenth century.\nMICHAEL FARADA Y (1791–1867)\n EXAMPLE  6.2\nReprint 2025-26\n\nElectromagnetic\nInduction\n159\n EXAMPLE  6.2Solution The angle q made by the area vector of the coil with the\nmagnetic field is 45°. From Eq. (6.1), the initial magnetic flux is\nF = BA cos q\n–20.1 10Wb\n2×=\nFinal flux, Fmin = 0\nThe change in flux is brought about in 0.70 s. From Eq. (6.3), the\nmagnitude of the induced emf is given by\n()– 0B\nt tΦΦεΔ= =Δ Δ –310= 1.0 mV\n2 0.7=\n×\nAnd the magnitude of the current is\n–310 V2mA0.5IRε= = =Ω\nNote that the earth’s magnetic field also produces a flux through the\nloop. But it is a steady field (which does not change within the time\nspan of the experiment) and hence does not induce any emf.\nExample 6.3\nA circular coil of radius 10 cm, 500 turns and resistance 2 W is placed\nwith its plane perpendicular to the horizontal component of the earth’s\nmagnetic field. It is rotated about its vertical diameter through 180°\nin 0.25 s. Estimate the magnitudes of the emf and current induced in\nthe coil. Horizontal component of the earth’s magnetic field at the\nplace is 3.0 × 10–5 T.\nSolution\nInitial flux through the coil,\nFB (initial)= BA cos q\n= 3.0 × 10–5 × (p ×10–2) × cos 0°\n= 3p × 10–7 Wb\nFinal flux after the rotation,\nFB (final)    = 3.0 × 10–5 × (p ×10–2) × cos 180°\n= –3p  × 10–7 Wb\nTherefore, estimated value of the induced emf is,\nNtΦεΔ=Δ\n   = 500 × (6 p × 10–7)/0.25\n   = 3.8  × 10–3  V\nI = e/R = 1.9 × 10–3 A\nNote that the magnitudes of e and I are the estimated values. Their\ninstantaneous values are different and depend upon the speed of\nrotation at the particular instant. EXAMPLE  6.3\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPhysics\n1606.5  L ENZ’ S LAW AND C ONSER VATION OF ENERGY\nIn 1834, German physicist Heinrich Friedrich Lenz (1804-1865) deduced\na rule, known as \nLenz’s law which gives the polarity of the induced emf\nin a clear and concise fashion. The statement of the law is:\nThe polarity of induced emf is such that it tends to produce a current\nwhich opposes the change in magnetic flux that produced it.\nThe negative sign shown in Eq. (6.3) repr esents this ef fect. W e can\nunderstand Lenz’s law by examining Experiment 6.1 in Section 6.2.1. In\nFig. 6.1, we see that the North-pole of a bar magnet is being pushed\ntowards the closed coil. As the North-pole of the bar magnet moves towards\nthe coil, the magnetic flux through the coil increases. Hence current is\ninduced in the coil in such a direction that it opposes the increase in flux.\nThis is possible only if the current in the coil is in a counter -clockwise\ndirection with respect to an observer situated on the side of the magnet.\nNote that magnetic moment associated with this current has North polarity\ntowards the North-pole of the approaching magnet. Similarly, if the North-\npole of the magnet is being withdrawn from the coil, the magnetic flux\nthrough the coil will decrease. To counter this decrease in magnetic flux,\nthe induced current in the coil flows in clockwise direction and its South-\npole faces the receding North-pole of the bar magnet. This would result in\nan attractive force which opposes the motion of the magnet and the\ncorresponding decrease in flux.\nWhat will happen if an open circuit is used in place of the closed loop\nin the above example? In this case too, an emf is induced across the open\nends of the circuit. The direction of the induced emf can be found\nusing Lenz’s law. Consider Figs. 6.6 (a) and (b). They provide an easier\nway to understand the direction of induced currents. Note that the\ndirection shown by  and  indicate the directions of the induced\ncurrents.\nA little reflection on this matter should convince us on the\ncorrectness of Lenz’s law. Suppose that the induced current was in\nthe direction opposite to the one depicted in Fig. 6.6(a). In that case,\nthe South-pole due to the induced current will face the approaching\nNorth-pole of the magnet. The bar magnet will then be attracted\ntowards the coil at an ever increasing acceleration. A gentle push on\nthe magnet will initiate the process and its velocity and kinetic energy\nwill continuously increase without expending any energy. If this can\nhappen, one could construct a perpetual-motion machine by a\nsuitable arrangement. This violates the law of conservation of energy\nand hence can not happen.\nNow consider the correct case shown in Fig. 6.6(a). In this situation,\nthe bar magnet experiences a repulsive force due to the induced\ncurrent. Therefore, a person has to do work in moving the magnet.\nWhere does the energy spent by the person go? This energy is\ndissipated by Joule heating produced by the induced current.FIGURE  6.6\nIllustration of\nLenz’s law.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nElectromagnetic\nInduction\n161\n EXAMPLE  6.4Example 6.4\nFigure 6.7 shows planar loops of different shapes moving out of or\ninto a region of a magnetic field which is directed normal to the plane\nof the loop away fr om the r eader . Deter mine the dir ection of induced\ncurrent in each loop using Lenz’s law.\nFIGURE  6.7\nSolution\n(i)The magnetic flux through the rectangular loop abcd increases,\ndue to the motion of the loop into the region of magnetic field, The\ninduced current must flow along the path bcdab so that it opposes\nthe increasing flux.\n(ii)Due to the outward motion, magnetic flux through the triangular\nloop abc decreases due to which the induced current flows along\nbacb, so as to oppose the change in flux.\n(iii)As the magnetic flux decreases due to motion of the irregular\nshaped loop abcd out of the region of magnetic field, the induced\ncurrent flows along cdabc, so as to oppose change in flux.\nNote that there are no induced current as long as the loops are\ncompletely inside or outside the region of the magnetic field.\nExample 6.5\n(a)A closed loop is held stationary in the magnetic field between the\nnorth and south poles of two permanent magnets held fixed. Can\nwe hope to generate current in the loop by using very strong\nmagnets?\n(b)A closed loop moves normal to the constant electric field between\nthe plates of a lar ge capacitor . Is a curr ent induced in the loop\n(i) when it is wholly inside the region between the capacitor plates\n(ii) when it is partially outside the plates of the capacitor? The\nelectric field is normal to the plane of the loop.\n(c)A rectangular loop and a circular loop are moving out of a uniform\nmagnetic field region (Fig. 6.8) to a field-free region with a constant\nvelocity v. In which loop do you expect the induced emf to be\nconstant during the passage out of the field region?  The field is\nnormal to the loops. EXAMPLE  6.5\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPhysics\n162\n EXAMPLE  6.5FIGURE  6.8\n(d)Predict the polarity of the capacitor in the situation described by\nFig. 6.9.\nFIGURE  6.9\nSolution\n(a)No. However strong the magnet may be, current can be induced\nonly by changing the magnetic flux through the loop.\n(b)No current is induced in either  case. Current can not be induced\nby changing the electric flux.\n(c)The induced emf is expected to be constant only in the case of the\nrectangular loop. In the case of circular loop, the rate of change of\narea of the loop during its passage out of the field region is not\nconstant, hence induced emf will vary accordingly.\n(d)The polarity of plate ‘A’ will be positive with respect to plate ‘B’ in\nthe capacitor .\n6.6  M OTIONAL E LECTROMOTIVE F ORCE\nLet us consider a straight conductor moving in a uniform and time-\nindependent magnetic field.  Figure 6.10 shows a rectangular conductor\nPQRS  in which the conductor PQ is free to move. The rod PQ is moved\ntowards the left with a constant velocity v  as\nshown in the figure. Assume that there is no\nloss of energy due to friction. PQRS forms a\nclosed circuit enclosing an area that changes\nas PQ moves. It is placed in a uniform magnetic\nfield B which is perpendicular to the plane of\nthis system. If the length RQ = x and RS = l, the\nmagnetic flux FB enclosed  by the loop PQRS\nwill be\nFB = Blx\nSince x is changing with time, the rate of change\nof flux FB will induce an emf given by:\n( )– d d–d dBBlxt tΦε= =\n   = d–dxBl Blvt= (6.5)FIGURE  6.10  The arm PQ is moved to the left\nside, thus decreasing the area of the\nrectangular loop. This movement\ninduces a current I as shown.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nElectromagnetic\nInduction\n163where we have used dx /dt = –v  which is the speed of the conductor PQ.\nThe induced emf Blv is called motional emf . Thus, we are able to produce\ninduced emf by moving a conductor instead of varying the magnetic field,\nthat is, by changing the magnetic flux enclosed by the circuit.\nIt is also possible to explain the motional emf expression in Eq. (6.5)\nby invoking the Lorentz force acting on the free charge carriers of conductor\nPQ. Consider any arbitrary charge q in the conductor PQ. When the rod\nmoves with speed v, the charge will also be moving with speed \nv in the\nmagnetic field B. The Lorentz force on this charge is qvB in magnitude,\nand its direction is towards Q. All charges experience the same force, in\nmagnitude and direction, irrespective of their position in the rod PQ.\nThe work done in moving the charge from P to Q is,\nW = qvBl\nSince emf is the work done per unit charge,\nW\nqε=\n    = Blv\nThis equation gives emf induced across the rod PQ and is identical\nto Eq. (6.5). W e stress that our presentation is not wholly rigorous. But\nit does help us to understand the basis of Faraday’s law when\nthe conductor is moving in a uniform and time-independent\nmagnetic field.\nOn the other hand, it is not obvious how an emf is induced when a\nconductor is stationary and the magnetic field is changing – a fact which\nFaraday verified by numerous experiments. In the case of a stationary\nconductor , the for ce on its char ges is given by\nF = q (E + v ´ ´´´´ B) = q\nE (6.6)\nsince v = 0. Thus, any force on the charge must arise from the electric\nfield term E alone. Therefore, to explain the existence of induced emf or\ninduced current, we must assume that a time-varying magnetic field\ngenerates an electric field. However , we hasten to add that electric fields\nproduced by static electric charges have properties different from those\nproduced by time-varying magnetic fields. In ",

      "content": "Chapter 4, we learnt that\ncharges in motion (current) can exert force/torque on a stationary magnet.\nConversely, a bar magnet in motion (or more generally, a changing\nmagnetic field) can exert a force on the stationary charge. This is the\nfundamental significance of the Faraday’s discovery. Electricity and\nmagnetism are related.\nExample 6.6  A metallic rod of 1 m length is rotated  with a frequency\nof 50 rev/s, with one end hinged at the cent re and the other end at the\ncircumference of a circular metallic ring of radius 1  m, about an axis\npassing through the cent re and perpendicular to the plane of the ring\n(Fig. 6.11) . A constant and uniform magnetic field  of 1 T parallel to the\naxis is present everywhere. What is the emf  between the cent re and\nthe metallic ring? EXAMPLE  6.6\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPhysics\n164\n EXAMPLE  6.6FIGURE  6.11\nSolution\nMethod I\nAs the rod is rotated, free electrons in the rod move towards the outer\nend due to Lorentz force and get distributed over the ring. Thus, the\nresulting separation of charges produces an emf across the ends of\nthe rod. At a certain value of emf, there is no more flow of electrons\nand a steady state is reached. Using Eq. (6.5), the magnitude of the\nemf generated across a length d r of the rod as it moves at right angles\nto the magnetic field is given by\nd d Bv rε= .

These\ntwo situations are described separately in the next two sub-sections.\nHowever, in both the cases, the flux through a coil is proportional to the\ncurrent. That is,  ΦB α I.\nFurther, if the geometry of the coil does not vary with time then,\nd d\nd dB I\nt tΦ∝\nFor a closely wound coil of N turns, the same magnetic flux is linked\nwith all the turns. When the flux ΦB through the coil changes, each turn\ncontributes to the induced emf. Therefore, a term called flux linkage  is\nused which is equal to NΦB for a closely wound coil and in such a case\nNΦB∝ I\nThe constant of proportionality, in this relation, is called inductance .\nWe shall see that inductance depends only on the geometry of the coil\nand intrinsic material properties. This aspect is akin to capacitance which\nfor a parallel plate capacitor depends on the plate area and plate separation\n(geometry) and the dielectric constant K of the intervening medium\n(intrinsic material property).\nInductance is a scalar quantity. It has the dimensions of [M L2 T–2 A–2]\ngiven by the dimensions of flux divided by the dimensions of current. The\nSI unit of inductance is henry  and is denoted by H. It is named in honour\nof Joseph Henry who discovered electromagnetic induction in USA,\nindependently of Faraday in England.\n6.7.1  Mutual inductance\nConsider Fig. 6.12 which shows two long co-axial solenoids each of length\nl. We denote the radius of the inner solenoid S1 by r1 and the number of\nturns per unit length by n1. The corresponding quantities for the outer\nsolenoid S2 are r2 and n2, respectively. Let N1 and N2 be the total number\nof turns of coils S1 and S2, respectively.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPhysics\n166When a current I2 is set up through S2, it in turn sets\nup a magnetic flux through S1. Let us denote it by Φ1.\nThe corresponding flux linkage with  solenoid S1 is\nN11 12 2M IΦ= (6.7)\nM12 is called the mutual inductance  of solenoid S1 with\nrespect to solenoid S2. It is also referred to as the\ncoefficient of mutual induction .\nFor these simple co-axial solenoids it is possible to\ncalculate M12. The magnetic field due to the current I2 in\nS2 is µ0n2I2. The resulting flux linkage with coil S1 is,\n()()()2\n1 1 1 1 0 2 2N n l r n IΦ µ = π\n         2\n0 1 2 1 2n n r l Iµ= π (6.8)\nwhere n1l is the total number of turns in solenoid S1.\nThus, from Eq. (6.7) and Eq. (6.8),\nM12 = µ0n1n2πr2\n1l (6.9)\nNote that we neglected the edge effects and considered\nthe magnetic field µ0n2I2 to be uniform throughout the\nlength and width of the solenoid S2. This is a good approximation keeping\nin mind that the solenoid is long, implying l  >> r2.\nWe now consider the reverse case. A current I1 is passed through the\nsolenoid S1 and the flux linkage with coil S2 is,\nN2Φ2 = M21 I1(6.10)\nM21 is called the mutual inductance  of solenoid S2 with respect to\nsolenoid S1.\nThe flux due to the current I1 in S1 can be assumed to be confined\nsolely inside S1 since the solenoids are very long. Thus, flux linkage with\nsolenoid S2 is\n()()()2\n2 2 2 1 0 1 1N n l r n IΦ µ = π\nwhere n2l is the total number of turns of S2. From Eq. (6.10),\nM21 = µ0n1n2πr2\n1l (6.11)\nUsing Eq. (6.9) and Eq. (6.10), we get\nM12 = M21= M (say) (6.12)\nWe have demonstrated this equality for long co-axial solenoids.\nHowever, the relation is far more general. Note that if the inner solenoid\nwas much shorter than (and placed well inside) the outer solenoid, then\nwe could still have calculated the flux linkage N1Φ1 because the inner\nsolenoid is effectively immersed in a uniform magnetic field due to the\nouter solenoid. In this case, the calculation of M12 would be easy. However,\nit would be extremely difficult to calculate the flux linkage with the outer\nsolenoid as the magnetic field due to the inner solenoid would vary across\nthe length as well as cross section of the outer solenoid. Therefore, the\ncalculation of M21 would also be extremely difficult in this case. The\nequality M12=M21 is very useful in such situations.FIGURE  6.12 Two long co-axial\nsolenoids of same\nlength l.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nElectromagnetic\nInduction\n167\n EXAMPLE  6.8We explained the above example with air as the medium within the\nsolenoids. Instead, if a medium of relative permeability µr had been present,\nthe mutual inductance would be\nM =µr µ0 n1n2π r2\n1 l\nIt is also important to know that the mutual inductance of a pair of\ncoils, solenoids, etc., depends on their separation as well as their relative\norientation.\nExample  6.8 Two concentric circular coils, one of small radius r1 and\nthe other of large radius r2, such that r1 << r2,  are placed co-axially\nwith centres coinciding. Obtain the mutual inductance of the\narrangement.\nSolution  Let a current I2 flow through the outer circular coil. The\nfield at the centre of the coil is B2 = µ0I2 / 2r2. Since the other\nco-axially placed coil has a very small radius, B2 may be considered\nconstant over its cross-sectional area. Hence,\nΦ1 = πr2\n1B2\n     2\n0 1\n2\n22rIrµπ=\n     = M12 I2\nThus,\n2\n0 1\n12\n22rMrµπ=\nFrom Eq.

However, we\ncan accept this value because r1 << r2.\nNow, let us recollect Experiment 6.3 in Section 6.2. In that experiment,\nemf is induced in coil C1 wherever there was any change in current through\ncoil C2. Let Φ1 be the flux through coil C1 (say of N1 turns) when current in\ncoil C2 is I2.\nThen, from Eq. (6.7), we have\nN1Φ1 = MI2\nFor currents varrying with time,\n()() 1 1 2 d d\nd dN MI\nt tΦ=\nSince induced emf in coil C1 is given by\n()1 1d–dN\ntΦε1=\nWe get,\n2d–dIMtε1=\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPhysics\n168It shows that varying current in a coil can induce emf in a neighbouring\ncoil. The magnitude of the induced emf depends upon the rate of change\nof current and mutual inductance of the two coils.\n6.7.2  Self-inductance\nIn the previous sub-section, we considered the flux in one solenoid due\nto the current in the other.  It is also possible that emf is induced in a\nsingle isolated coil due to change of flux through the coil by means of\nvarying the current through the same coil. This phenomenon is called\nself-induction . In this case, flux linkage through a coil of N turns is\nproportional to the current through the coil and is expressed as\nBN IΦ∝\nBL N IΦ= (6.13)\nwhere constant of proportionality L is called self-inductance  of the coil. It\nis also called the coefficient of self-induction  of the coil. When the current\nis varied, the flux linked with the coil also changes and an emf is induced\nin the coil. Using Eq. (6.13), the induced emf is given by\n()B d–dN\ntΦε=\nd–dILtε= (6.14)\nThus, the self-induced emf always opposes any change  (increase or\ndecrease) of current in the coil.\nIt is possible to calculate the  self-inductance for circuits with simple\ngeometries. Let us calculate the self-inductance of a long solenoid of cross-\nsectional area A and length l, having n turns per unit length. The magnetic\nfield due to a current I flowing in the solenoid is B = µ0 n I  (neglecting edge\neffects, as before). The total flux linked with the solenoid is\n()()()0 BN nl n I AΦ µ=\nI Al n2\n0µ=\nwhere nl is the total number of turns. Thus, the self-inductance is,\nLIΒΝΦ=\n   2\n0n Alµ= (6.15)\nIf we fill the inside of the solenoid with a material of relative permeability\nµr (for example soft iron, which has a high value of relative permeability),\nthen,\n2\n0r L n Alµ µ= (6.16)\nThe self-inductance of the coil depends on its geometry and on the\npermeability of the medium.\nThe self-induced emf is also called the back em f as it opposes any\nchange in the current in a circuit. Physically, the self-inductance plays\nReprint 2025-26\n\nElectromagnetic\nInduction\n169the role of inertia . It is the electromagnetic analogue of mass in mechanics.\nSo, work needs to be done against the back emf ( ε) in establishing the\ncurrent. This work done is stored as magnetic potential energy. For the\ncurrent I at an instant in a circuit, the rate of work done is\nd\ndWItε=\nIf we ignore the resistive losses and consider only inductive effect,\nthen using Eq. (6.14),\nd d\nd dW IL It t=\nTotal amount of work done in establishing the current I is\nW W L I II\n= =∫ ∫d d\n0\nThus, the energy required to build up the current I is,\n21\n2W LI= (6.17)\nThis expression reminds us of mv2/2 for the (mechanical) kinetic energy\nof a particle of mass m, and shows that L is analogous to m (i.e., L is\nelectrical inertia and opposes growth and decay of current in the circuit).\nConsider the general case of currents flowing simultaneously in two\nnearby coils. The flux linked with one coil will be the sum of two fluxes\nwhich exist independently. Equation (6.7) would be modified into\nN11 11 1 12 2M I M IΦ= +\nwhere M11 represents inductance due to the same coil.\nTherefore, using Faraday’s law,\n1 2\n1 11 12d d\nd dI IM Mt tε= − −\nM11 is the self-inductance and is written as L1.

The\nmodern ac generator with a typical output\ncapacity of 100 MW is a highly evolved machine.\nIn this section, we shall describe the basic\nprinciples behind this machine. The Y ugoslav\ninventor Nicola Tesla is credited with the\ndevelopment of the machine. As was pointed out\nin Section 6.3, one method to induce an emf or\ncurrent in a loop is through a change in the\nloop’s orientation or a change in its effective area.\nAs the coil rotates in a magnetic field B , the\neffective area of the loop (the face perpendicular\nto the field) is A cos q, where q is the angle\nbetween A and B. This method of producing a\nflux change is the principle of operation of a\nReprint 2025-26\n\nElectromagnetic\nInduction\n171simple ac generator . An ac generator converts mechanical ener gy into\nelectrical energy.\nThe basic elements of an ac generator are shown in Fig. 6.13. It consists\nof a coil mounted on a rotor shaft. The axis of rotation of the coil is\nperpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field. The coil (called\narmature) is mechanically rotated in the  uniform magnetic field by some\nexternal means. The rotation of the coil causes the magnetic flux through\nit to change, so an emf is induced in the coil. The ends of the\ncoil are connected to an external circuit by means of slip rings\nand brushes.\nWhen the coil is rotated with a constant angular speed w, the angle q\nbetween the magnetic field vector B and the area vector A of the coil at any\ninstant t  is q  = wt (assuming q = 0° at t = 0). As a result, the effective area\nof the coil exposed to the magnetic field lines changes with time, and from\nEq. (6.1), the flux at any time t  is\nFB = BA cos q = BA  cos wt\nFrom Faraday’s law, the induced emf for the rotating coil of N  turns\nis then,\nd d– – (cos )dt dBN NBA ttΦε ω = =\nThus, the instantaneous value of the emf is\nε ω ω=NBA sin t (6.19)\nwhere NBA w is the maximum value of the emf, which occurs when\nsin wt = ±1. If we denote NBA w as e0, then\ne = e0 sin wt (6.20)\nSince the value of the sine fuction varies between +1 and –1, the sign, or\npolarity of the emf changes with time. Note from Fig. 6.14 that the emf\nhas its extremum value when q = 90° or q = 270°, as the change of flux is\ngreatest at these points.\nThe direction of the current changes periodically and therefore the current\nis called alternating curr ent (ac). Since w = 2pn, Eq (6.2 0) can be written as\ne = e0sin 2p n t (6.21)\nwhere n is the frequency of revolution of the generator’s coil.\nNote that Eq. (6.20) and (6.21) give the instantaneous value of the emf\nand e varies between + e0 and – e0 periodically. W e shall lear n how to\ndetermine the time-averaged value for the alternating voltage and current\nin the next chapter .\nIn commercial generators, the mechanical energy required for\nrotation of the armature is provided by water falling from a height, for\nexample, from dams. These are called hydro-electric generators .\nAlternatively, water is heated to produce steam using coal or other\nsources. The steam at high pressure produces the rotation of the\narmatur e. These ar e called thermal generators . Instead of coal, if a\nnuclear fuel is used, we get nuclear power generators .

If the circuit is\nclosed, a current I = e/R is set up in it, where R is the resistance of the\ncircuit.\n3.Lenz’s law states that the polarity of the induced emf is such that it\ntends to produce a current which opposes the change in magnetic flux\nthat produces it. The negative sign in the expression for Faraday’s law\nindicates this fact.\n4.When a metal rod of length l is placed normal to a uniform magnetic\nfield B and moved with a velocity v perpendicular to the field, the\ninduced emf (called motional em f) across its ends is\ne = Bl v\n5.Inductance is the ratio  of the flux -linkage  to current. It is equal to  NF/I.\n6.A changing current in a coil (coil 2) can induce an emf in a nearby coil\n(coil 1). This relation is given by,\n2\n1 12d\ndIMtε= −\nThe quantity M12 is called mutual inductance of coil 1 with respect to\ncoil 2. One can similarly define M21. There exists a general equality,\nM12 = M21\n7.When a current in a coil changes, it induces a back emf in the same\ncoil. The self-induced emf is given by,\nd\ndILtε= −\nL is the self-inductance of the coil. It is a measure of the inertia of the\ncoil against the change of current through it.\n8.The self-inductance of a long solenoid, the core of which consists of a\nmagnetic material of relative per meability mr, is given by\nL = mr  m0 n2 Al\nwhere A is the area of cross-section of the solenoid, l its length and n\nthe number of turns per unit length.\n9.In an ac generator , mechanical ener gy is converted to electrical ener gy\nby virtue of electromagnetic induction. If coil of N turn and area A  is\nrotated at n revolutions per second in a uniform magnetic field B, then\nthe motional emf produced is\ne = NBA (2pn) sin (2pnt)\nwhere we have assumed that at time t = 0 s, the coil is perpendicular to\nthe field.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPhysics\n174POINTS TO PONDER\n1.Electricity and magnetism are intimately related. In the early part of the\nnineteenth century, the experiments of Oersted, Ampere and others\nestablished that moving charges (currents) produce a magnetic field.\nSomewhat later , around 1830, the experiments of Faraday and Henry\ndemonstrated that a moving magnet can induce electric current.\n2.In a closed circuit, electric currents are induced so as to oppose the\nchanging magnetic flux. It is as per the law of conservation of energy.\nHowever , in case of an open cir cuit, an emf is induced acr oss its ends.\nHow is it related to the flux change?\n3.The motional emf discussed in Section 6.5 can be argued independently\nfrom Faraday’s law using the Lor entz for ce on moving char ges. However ,\neven if the charges are stationary [and the q (v × B) term of the Lorentz\nforce is not operative], an emf is nevertheless induced in the presence of a\ntime-varying magnetic field. Thus, moving charges in static field and static\ncharges in a time-varying field seem to be symmetric situation for Faraday’s\nlaw. This gives a tantalising hint on the relevance of the principle of\nrelativity for Faraday’s law.\nEXERCISES\n6.1 Predict the direction of induced current in the situations described\nby the following Figs. 6.15(a) to (f).Quantity Symbol Units Dimensions Equations\nMagnetic Flux FBWb (weber) [M L2 T–2 A–1] FB = B Ai\nEMF e V (volt) [M L2 T–3 A–1] e = B d( )/dN tΦ−\nMutual Inductance M H (henry) [M L2 T–2 A–2] e1 ()12 2d /dM I t= −\nSelf Inductance L H (henry) [M L2 T–2 A–2] () d /dL I tε= −\nReprint 2025-26\n\nElectromagnetic\nInduction\n175\nFIGURE  6.15\n6.2 Use Lenz’s law to determine the direction of induced current in the\nsituations described by Fig. 6.16:\n(a)A wire of irregular shape turning into a circular shape;\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPhysics\n176(b)A circular loop being deformed into a narrow straight wire.\nFIGURE  6.16\n6.3 A long solenoid with 15 turns per cm has a small loop of area 2.0 cm2\nplaced inside the solenoid normal to its axis.
