Later , you will realise that x3 may also be read\nas x raised to the power 3.\nx, x2, x3, ... are all algebraic expressions obtained from x.\n(ii)The expression 2y2 is obtained from y:2y2 = 2 × y × y\nHere by multiplying y with y we obtain y2 and then we multiply y2 by the constant 2.\n(iii) In (3x2 – 5) we first obtain x2, and multiply it by 3 to get 3 x2.\nFrom 3 x2, we subtract 5 to finally arrive at 3 x2 – 5.\n(iv) In xy, we multiply the variable x with another variable y. Thus,\nx × y = xy.\n (v) In 4xy + 7, we first obtain xy, multiply it by 4 to get 4 xy and\nadd 7 to 4\nxy to get the expression.\n10.3  T ERMS OF AN EXPRESSION\nWe shall now put in a systematic form what we have learnt above about how expressions\nare formed. For this purpose, we need to understand what terms  of an expression and\ntheir factors  are.\nConsider the expression (4x  + 5). In forming this expression, we first formed 4x\nseparately as a product of 4 and x and then added 5 to it. Similarly consider the expression\n(3x2 + 7y). Here we first formed 3 x2 separately as a product of 3, x and x . We then\nformed 7 y separately as a product of 7 and y. Having formed 3 x2 and 7 y separately , we\nadded them to get the expression.\nYou will find that the expressions we deal with can always be seen this way . They\nhave parts which are formed separately and then added. Such parts of an expression\nwhich are formed separately first and then added are known as terms . Look at the\nexpression (4 x2 – 3xy). We say that it has two terms, 4 x2 and –3 xy. The term 4 x2 is a\nproduct of 4, x and x, and the term (–3 xy) is a product of (–3), x and y.\nTerms ar e added to form expressions. Just as the terms 4x  and 5 are added to\nform the expression (4 x + 5), the terms 4 x2 and (–3 xy) are added to give the expression\n(4x2 – 3xy). This is because 4 x2 + (–3 xy) = 4x2 – 3xy.\nNote, the minus sign (–)  is included in the term. In the expression 4x2 –3xy, we\ntook the term as (–3 xy) and not as (3 xy). That is why we do not need to say that\nterms are ‘added or subtracted’ to form an expression; just ‘added’ is enough.\nFactors of a term\nWe saw above that the expression (4x2 – 3xy) consists of two terms 4 x2 and –3xy . The\nterm 4 x2 is a product of 4, x and x; we say that 4, x and x are the factors of the term 4 x2.\nA term is a product of its factors. The term –3 xy is a product of the factors –3, x and y.Describe how the\nfollowing expressions\nare obtained:\n7xy + 5, x2y, 4x2 – 5\nxTRY THESE\n2024-25\n\nMATHEMA TICS 162\nWe can represent the terms and factors of\nthe terms of an expression conveniently and\nelegantly by a tree diagram. The tree for the\nexpression (4 x2 – 3xy) is as shown in the\nadjacent figure.\nNote, in the tree diagram, we have used\ndotted lines for factors and continuous lines for\nterms. This is to avoid mixing them.\nLet us draw a tree diagram for the expression\n5xy + 10.\nThe factors are such that they cannot be\nfurther factorised. Thus we do not write 5 xy as\n5 × xy, because xy can be further factorised.\nSimilarly , if x3 were a term, it would be written as\nx × x × x and not x2 × x. Also, remember that\n1 is not taken as a separate factor .\nCoefficients\nWe have learnt how to write a term as a product of factors.\nOne of these factors may be numerical and the others algebraic\n(i.e., they contain variables). The numerical factor is said to be\nthe numerical coefficient or simply the coefficient of the term.\nIt is also said to be the coefficient of the rest of the term (which\nis obviously the product of algebraic factors of  the term). Thus\nin 5xy, 5 is the coef ficient  of the term . It is also the coef ficient\nof xy. In the term 10 xyz, 10 is the coef ficient of xyz, in the term\n–7x2y2, –7 is the coefficient of x2y2.\nWhen the coefficient of a term is +1, it is usually omitted.\nFor example, 1 x is written as x; 1 x2y2 is written as x2y2 and\nso on. Also, the coef ficient (–1) is indicated only by the minus sign. Thus (–1) x is\nwritten as –  x; (–1) x2 y2 is written as –  x2 y2 and so on.\nSometimes, the word ‘coef ficient’  is used in a more general way . Thus\nwe say that in the term 5 xy, 5 is the coef ficient of xy, x is the coef ficient of 5 y\nand y is the coefficient of 5 x. In 1\n0xy2, 10 is the coefficient of xy2, x is the\ncoefficient of 1 0y2 and y2 is the coefficient of 10 x. Thus, in this more general\nway, a coef ficient may be either a numerical factor or an algebraic factor or\na product of two or more factors. It is said to be the coefficient of the\nproduct of the remaining factors.\nEXAMPLE  1Identify , in the following expressions, terms which are\nnot constants.

When terms have different\nalgebraic factors, they are unlike  terms. For example, in the expression 2 xy – 3x + 5xy – 4,\nlook at the terms 2 xy and 5 xy. The factors of 2 xy are 2, x and y. The factors of 5 xy are 5,\nx and y. Thus their algebraic (i.e., those which contain variables) factors are the same and\n2024-25\n\nMATHEMA TICS 164\nhence they are like terms. On the other hand the\nterms 2 xy and –3 x, have different algebraic factors.\nThey are unlike terms. Similarly , the terms, 2 xy\nand 4, are unlike terms. Also, the terms –3 x and 4\nare unlike terms.\n10.5 MONOMIALS , BINOMIALS , TRINOMIALS  AND\nPOLYNOMIALS\nAn expression with only one term is called a monomial ; for example, 7 xy, – 5m,\n3z2, 4 etc.\nAn expression which contains two unlike terms is called a\nbinomial ; for example, x + y, m – 5, mn + 4\nm, a2 – b2 are\nbinomials. The expression 10pq is not a binomial; it is a\nmonomial. The expression ( a + b + 5) is not a binomial.\nIt contains three terms.\nAn expression which contains three terms is called a\ntrinomial ; for example, the expressions x + y + 7, ab + a +b,\n3x2 – 5x  + 2, m + n + 10 are trinomials. The expression\nab + a + b + 5 is, however not a trinomial; it contains four\nterms and not three. The expression x +  y + 5x is not a trinomial\nas the terms x and 5 x are like terms.\nIn general, an expression with one or more terms is called a polynomial. Thus a\nmonomial, a binomial and a trinomial are all polynomials.\nEXAMPLE  3State with reasons, which of the following pairs of terms are of like\nterms and which are of unlike terms:\n(i)7x, 12y (ii)15x, –21 x (iii) – 4ab, 7ba (iv) 3xy, 3x\n(v)6xy2, 9x2y (vi) pq2, – 4pq2(vii) mn2, 10mn\nSOLUTION\nS.

There are a number of situations in which we need to find the value\nof an expression, such as when we wish to check whether a particular value of a variable\nsatisfies a given equation or not.\nWe find values of expressions, also, when we use formulas from geometry and from\neveryday mathematics. For example, the area of a square is l2, where l is the length of a\nside of the square. If l =  5 cm., the area is 52 cm2 or 25 cm2; if the side is 10 cm, the area\nis 102 cm2 or 100 cm2 and so on. We shall see more such examples in the next section.\n2024-25\n\nALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS 167\nEXAMPLE  4Find the values of the following expressions for x = 2.\n(i)x + 4 (ii)4x – 3 (iii) 19 – 5 x2\n(iv) 100 – 10 x3\nSOLUTION Putting x = 2\n(i)In x + 4, we get the value of x + 4, i.e.,\nx + 4 = 2 + 4 = 6\n(ii)In 4x – 3, we get\n4x – 3 =  (4 × 2) – 3 = 8 – 3 = 5\n(iii) In 19 – 5 x2, we get\n19 – 5 x2 = 19 – (5 × 22) = 19 – (5 × 4) = 19 – 20 = – 1\n(iv) In 100 – 10\nx3, we get\n100 – 10 x3 = 100 – (10 × 23) = 100 – (10 × 8) (Note 23 = 8)\n= 100 – 80 = 20\nEXAMPLE  5Find the value of the following expressions when n =  – 2.\n(i)5n – 2 (ii)5n2 + 5n – 2 (iii) n3 + 5n2 + 5n – 2\nSOLUTION\n(i)Putting the value of n = – 2, in 5 n – 2, we get,\n5(– 2) – 2 = – 10 – 2 = – 12\n(ii)In 5n2 + 5n – 2, we have,\nfor n = –2, 5 n – 2 = –12\nand 5 n2 = 5 × (– 2)2 = 5 × 4 = 20 [as (– 2)2 = 4]\nCombining,\n5n2 + 5n – 2 = 20 – 12 = 8\n(iii) Now , for n = – 2,\n5n2 + 5n – 2 = 8 and\nn3 = (–2)3 = (–2) × (–2) × (–2) = – 8\nCombining,\nn3 + 5n2 + 5n – 2 = – 8 + 8 = 0\nWe shall now consider expressions of two variables, for example, x + y, xy. To work\nout the numerical value of an expression of two variables, we need to give the values of\nboth variables. For example, the value of ( x + y), for x = 3 and y = 5, is 3 + 5 = 8.\n2024-25\n\nMATHEMA TICS 168\nEXAMPLE  6Find the value of the following expressions for a = 3, b = 2.\n(i)a + b (ii)7a – 4b (iii) a2 + 2ab\n + b2\n(iv) a3 – b3\nSOLUTION Substituting a = 3 and b = 2 in\n(i)a + b, we get\na + b = 3 + 2 = 5\n(ii)7a – 4 b, we get\n7a – 4b = 7 × 3 – 4 × 2 = 21 – 8 = 13.\n(iii) a2 + 2ab + b2,  we get\na2 + 2ab + b2 = 32 + 2 × 3 × 2 + 22 = 9 + 2 × 6 + 4 = 9 + 12 + 4 = 25\n(iv) a3 – b3, we get\na3 – b3 = 33 – 23 = 3 × 3 × 3 – 2 × 2 × 2 = 9 × 3 – 4 × 2 = 27 – 8 = 19\nEXERCISE  10.2\n1.If m = 2, find the value of:\n(i)m – 2 (ii)3m – 5 (iii) 9 – 5 m\n(iv) 3m2 – 2m – 7 (v)5\n24m\u0013\n2.If p = – 2, find the value of:\n(i)4p + 7 (ii)– 3p2 + 4p + 7 (iii) – 2p3 – 3p2 + 4p + 7\n3.Find the value of the following expressions, when x = –1:\n(i)2\nx – 7 (ii)– x + 2 (iii) x2 + 2x + 1\n(iv) 2x2 – x – 2\n4.If a = 2, b = – 2, find the value of:\n(i)a2 + b2(ii)a2 + ab + b2(iii) a2 – b2\n5.When a = 0, b = – 1, find the value of the given expressions:\n(i)2a + 2 b (ii)2a2 + b2 + 1 (iii) 2a2b + 2 ab2 + ab\n(iv) a2 + ab + 2\n6.Simplify the expressions and find the value if x is equal to 2\n(i) x + 7 + 4 ( x – 5) (ii)3 (x + 2) + 5x  – 7\n(iii) 6x + 5 ( x – 2) (iv) 4(2x – 1) + 3x  + 11\n7.Simplify these expressions and find their values if x = 3, a = – 1, b = – 2.\n(i)3x – 5 – x + 9 (ii)2 – 8 x + 4x  + 4\n2024-25\n\nALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS 169\n(iii)  3a + 5 – 8 a + 1 (iv) 10 – 3 b  – 4 – 5b\n(v) 2a – 2b – 4 – 5 + a\n8.

Simplify the expression and find its value when a = 5 and b = – 3.\n2(a2 + ab) + 3 – ab\n WHAT HAVE WE DISCUSSED ?\n1.Algebraic expr essions  are formed from variables  and constants.  We use the\noperations of addition, subtraction, multiplication  and division  on the variables\nand constants to form expressions. For example, the expression 4 xy + 7 is formed\nfrom the variables x and y and constants 4 and 7. The constant 4 and the variables\nx and y are multiplied to give the product 4 xy and the constant 7 is added to this\nproduct to give the expression.\n2.Expressions are made up of terms . Terms are added  to make an expression. For\nexample, the addition of the terms 4 xy and 7 gives the expression 4 xy + 7.\n3.A term is a product of factors . The term 4 xy in the expression 4 xy + 7 is a product\nof factors x, y and 4. Factors containing variables are said to be algebraic factors .\n4.The coefficient  is the numerical factor in the term. Sometimes anyone factor in a\nterm is called the coefficient of the remaining part of the term.\n5.Any expression with one or more terms is called a polynomial . Specifically a one\nterm expression is called a monomial ; a two-term expression is called a binomial ;\nand a three-term expression is called a trinomial .\n6.Terms which have the same algebraic factors are like terms. Terms\nwhich have different algebraic factors are unlike  terms. Thus,\nterms 4 xy and –  3xy are like terms; but terms 4xy and –  3x are\nnot like terms.\n7.In situations such as solving an equation and using a formula, we\nhave to find the value of an expression . The value of the\nexpression depends on the value of the variable from which the\nexpression is formed. Thus, the value of 7 x – 3 for x = 5 is 32,\nsince 7(5) – 3 = 35 – 3 = 32.\n2024-25\n\n",
