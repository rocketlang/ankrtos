The magnitude of its acceleration is   ac = v2 /R. The\ndirection of ac is always towards the centre of the circle.\nThe angular speed ω, is the rate of change of angular distance. It is related to velocity\nv by   v = ωR.

The displacement depends only on the end points; the\npath length (as the name implies) depends on the actual path. The two quantities are\nequal only if the object does not change its direction during the course of motion. In all\nother cases, the path length is greater than the magnitude of displacement.\n2.In view of point 1 above, the average speed of an object is greater than or equal to the\nmagnitude of the average velocity over a given time interval. The two are equal only if the\npath length is equal to the magnitude of displacement.\n3.The vector equations (3.33a) and (3.34a) do not involve any choice of axes. Of course,\nyou can always resolve them along any two independent axes.\n4. The kinematic equations for uniform acceleration do not apply to the case of uniform\ncircular motion since in this case the magnitude of acceleration is constant but its\ndirection is changing.\n5. An object subjected to two velocities v1 and v2 has a resultant velocity v = v1 + v2. Take\ncare to distinguish it from velocity of object 1 relative to velocity of object 2 : v12= v1 − v2.\nHere v1 and v2 are velocities with reference to some common reference frame.\n",
