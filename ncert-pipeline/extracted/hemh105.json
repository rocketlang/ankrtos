Numbers between square numbers\nLet us now see if we can find some interesting pattern between two consecutive\nsquare numbers.\n1 (=12)\n2, 3, 4 (= 22)\n5, 6, 7, 8 , 9 (= 32)\n10, 1 1, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 (= 42)\n17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 (= 52)\nBetween 12(=1) and 22(= 4) there are two (i.e., 2 × 1) non square numbers 2, 3.\nBetween 22(= 4) and 32(= 9) there are four (i.e., 2 × 2) non square numbers 5, 6, 7, 8.\nNow , 32 = 9,       42 = 16\nTherefore, 42 – 32 = 16 – 9 = 7\nBetween 9(=32) and 16(= 42) the numbers are 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 that is, six\nnon-square numbers which is 1 less than the difference of two squares.\nWe have 42 = 16     and     52 = 25\nTherefore, 52 – 42 = 9\nBetween 16(= 42) and 25(= 52) the numbers  are 17, 18, ... , 24 that is, eight non square\nnumbers which is 1 less than the difference of two squares.\nConsider 72 and 62. Can you say how many numbers are there between 62 and 72?\nIf we think of any natural number n and ( n + 1), then,\n(n + 1)2 – n2 = (n2 + 2n + 1) – n2 = 2n + 1.\nWe find that between n2 and ( n + 1)2 there are 2 n numbers which is 1 less than the\ndifference of two squares.\nThus, in general we can say that there are 2n non perfect square numbers between\nthe squar es of the numbers n and (n + 1).

Can you\nexpress these numbers as a sum of successive odd natural numbers beginning from 1?\nYou will find that these numbers cannot be expressed in this form.\nConsider the number 25. Successively subtract 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, ... from it\n(i)25 – 1 = 24 (ii)24 – 3 = 21 (iii) 21 – 5 = 16 (iv) 16 – 7 = 9\n(v)9 – 9 = 0\nThis means, 25 = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9. Also, 25 is a perfect square.\nNow consider another number 38, and again do as above.\n(i)38 – 1 = 37 (ii)37 – 3 = 34 (iii) 34 – 5 = 29 (iv) 29 – 7 = 22\n(v)22 – 9 = 13 (vi) 13 – 1 1 = 2 (vii) 2 – 13 = – 1 1\nThis shows that we are not able to express  38 as the\nsum of consecutive odd numbers starting with 1. Also, 38 is\nnot a perfect square.\nSo we can also say that if a natural number cannot be\nexpr essed as a sum of successive odd natural numbers\nstarting with 1, then it is not a perfect square .\nWe can use this result to find whether a number is a perfect\nsquare or not.\n4.

But can we find the\nsquare of 23 so quickly?\nThe answer is not so easy and we may need to multiply 23 by 23.\nThere is a way to find this without having to multiply 23 × 23.\nWe know 23 = 20 + 3\nTherefore 232 =(20 + 3)2 = 20(20 + 3) + 3(20 + 3)\n= 202 + 20 × 3 + 3 × 20 + 32\n=400 + 60 + 60 + 9 = 529\nExample 1:  Find the square of the following numbers without actual multiplication.\n(i)39 (ii)42\nSolution:  (i) 392 =(30 + 9)2 = 30(30 + 9) + 9(30 + 9)\n= 302 + 30 × 9 + 9 × 30 + 92\n=900 + 270 + 270 + 81 = 1521\n                    (ii) 422 =(40 + 2)2 = 40(40 + 2) + 2(40 + 2)\n= 402 + 40 × 2 + 2 × 40 + 22\n=1600 + 80 + 80 + 4 = 1764\n5.4.1  Other patterns in squares\nConsider the following pattern:\n252 =625 = (2 × 3) hundreds + 25\n352 =1225 = (3 × 4) hundreds + 25\n752 =5625 = (7 × 8) hundreds + 25\n1252 =15625 = (12 × 13) hundreds + 25\nNow can you find the square of 95?\nFind the squares of the following numbers containing 5 in unit’ s place.\n(i)15 (ii)95 (iii) 105 (iv) 205\n5.4.2  Pythagorean tripletsConsider the following\n3\n2 + 42 =9 + 16 = 25 = 52\nThe collection of numbers 3, 4 and 5 is known as Pythagorean triplet . 6, 8, 10 is\nalso a Pythagorean triplet, since\n62 + 82 =36 + 64 = 100 = 102\nAgain, observe that\n52 + 122 = 25 + 144 = 169 = 132. The numbers 5, 12, 13 form another such triplet.Consider a number with unit digit 5, i.e., a5\n(a5)2 =(10a + 5)2\n=10a(10a + 5) + 5(10a  + 5)\n=100a2 + 50 a + 50 a + 25\n=100a(a + 1) + 25\n=a(a + 1) hundred + 25\nReprint 2024-25\n\n\nCan you find more such triplets?\nFor any natural number m > 1, we have (2m )2 + (m2 – 1)2 = (m2 + 1)2. So, 2 m,\nm2 – 1 and m2 + 1 forms a Pythagorean triplet.\nTry to find some more Pythagorean triplets using this form.\nExample 2:  Write a Pythagorean triplet whose smallest member is 8.\nSolution:  We can get Pythagorean triplets by using general form 2 m, m2 – 1, m2 + 1.\nLet us first take m2 – 1 = 8\nSo, m2 =8 + 1 = 9\nwhich gives m =3\nTherefore, 2m =6   and    m2 + 1 = 10\nThe triplet is thus 6, 8, 10.  But 8 is not the smallest member of this.\nSo, let us try 2m =8\nthen m =4\nWe get m2 – 1 = 16 – 1 = 15\nand m2 + 1 = 16 + 1 = 17\nThe triplet is 8, 15, 17 with 8 as the smallest member .\nExample 3:  Find a Pythagorean triplet in which one member is 12.\nSolution:  If we take m2 – 1 = 12\nThen, m2 =12 + 1 = 13\nThen the value of m will not be an integer .\nSo, we try to take m2 + 1 = 12. Again m2 = 11 will not give an integer value for m.\nSo, let us take 2m =12\nthen m =6\nThus, m2 – 1 = 36 – 1 = 35    and m2 + 1 = 36 + 1 = 37\nTherefore, the required triplet is 12, 35, 37.Note:  All Pythagorean triplets may not be obtained using this form. For example another\ntriplet 5, 12, 13 also has 12 as a member.\nEXERCISE 5.2\n1.Find the square of the following numbers.\n(i)32 (ii)35 (iii) 86 (iv) 93\n(v)71 (vi) 46\n2.Write a Pythagorean triplet whose one member is.\n(i)6 (ii)14 (iii) 16 (iv) 18\n5.5  Square Roots\nStudy the following situations.\n(a)Area of a square is 144 cm2.

Finding the\nnumber with the known square is known as finding the square root.\n5.5.1  Finding square roots\nThe inverse (opposite) operation of addition is subtraction and the inverse operation\nof multiplication is division. Similarly , finding the square root is the inverse operation\nof squaring.\nWe have, 12 =1, therefore square root of 1 is 1\n22 =4, therefore square root of 4 is 2\n32 =9, therefore square root of 9 is 3Fig 5.1\nFig 5.2\nTRY THESE\n(i)112 = 121.

That is, every square\nnumber can be expressed as a sum of successive odd natural numbers starting from 1.\nConsider 81. Then,\n(i)81 – 1 = 80 (ii)80 – 3 = 77 (iii) 77 – 5 = 72 (iv) 72 – 7 = 65\n(v)65 – 9 = 56 (vi) 56 – 1 1 = 45 (vii) 45 – 13 = 32 (viii) 32 – 15 = 17\n(ix) 17 – 17 = 0\nFrom 81 we have subtracted successive odd\nnumbers starting from 1 and obtained 0 at 9th step.\nTherefore 81 = 9.\nCan you find the square root of  729 using this method?\nYes, but it will be time consuming. Let us try to find it in\na simpler way .\n5.5.3  Finding square root through prime factorisation\nConsider the prime factorisation of the following numbers and their squares.\nPrime factorisation of a Number Prime factorisation of its Square\n6 =2 × 3 36 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 3\n8 = 2 × 2 × 2 64 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2\n12 = 2 × 2 × 3 144 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3\n15 = 3 × 5 225 = 3 × 3 × 5 × 5\nHow many times does 2 occur in the prime factorisation of 6? Once. How many times\ndoes 2 occur in the prime factorisation of 36? Twice. Similarly , observe the occurrence of\n3 in 6 and 36 of 2 in 8 and 64 etc.\nYou will find that each prime factor in the prime factorisation of the\nsquare of a number, occurs twice the number of times it occurs in the\nprime factorisation of the number itself. Let us use this to find the squareroot of a given square number, say 324.We know that the prime factorisation of 324 is\n324 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3TRY THESE\nBy repeated subtraction of odd numbers startingfrom 1, find whether the following numbers areperfect squares or not? If the number is a perfectsquare then find its square root.\n(i)121\n(ii)55\n(iii) 36\n(iv) 49\n(v)90\n2 324\n2 162\n3 81\n3 2739\n3\nReprint 2024-25\n\n\nBy pairing the prime factors, we get\n324 = 2 × 2  × 3 × 3  × 3 × 3   = 22 × 32 × 32 = (2 × 3 × 3)2\nSo, 324=2 × 3 × 3 = 18\nSimilarly can you find the square root of  256? Prime factorisation of  256 is\n256 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2\nBy pairing the prime factors we get,\n256 = 2 × 2  × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2  = (2 × 2 × 2 × 2)2\nTherefore, 256  = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 16\nIs 48 a perfect square?\nWe know 48 = 2 × 2  × 2 × 2 × 3\nSince all the factors are not in pairs so 48 is not a perfect square.\nSuppose we want to find the smallest multiple of 48 that is a perfect square, how\nshould we proceed? Making pairs of the prime factors of 48 we see that 3 is the only\nfactor that does not have a pair . So we need to multiply by 3 to complete the pair .\nHence 48 × 3 = 144 is a perfect square.\nCan you tell by which number should we divide 48 to get a perfect square?\nThe factor 3 is not in pair, so if we divide 48 by 3 we get 48 ÷ 3 = 16 = 2 × 2  × 2 × 2\nand this number 16 is a perfect square too.\nExample 4:Find the square root of 6400.\nSolution : Write 6400 = 2 × 2  × 2 × 2  × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 5 × 5\nTherefore 6400  =2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 5 = 80\nExample 5: Is 90 a perfect square?\nSolution : We have 90 = 2 × 3 × 3 × 5\nThe prime factors 2 and 5 do not occur in pairs. Therefore, 90 is not a perfect square.\nThat 90 is not a perfect square can also be seen from the fact that  it has only one zero.\nExample 6: Is 2352 a perfect square? If not, find the smallest multiple of 2352 which\nis a perfect square. Find the square root of the new number .\nSolution : We have 2352 = 2 × 2  × 2 × 2 × 3 × 7 × 7\nAs the prime factor 3 has no pair, 2352 is not a perfect square.\nIf 3 gets a pair then the number will become perfect square. So, we multiply 2352 by 3 to get,\n2352 × 3 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 7 × 7\nNow each prime factor is in a pair . Therefore, 2352 × 3 = 7056   is a perfect square.\nThus the required smallest multiple of 2352 is 7056 which is a perfect square.\nAnd, 7056  =2 × 2 × 3 × 7 = 84\nExample 7:  Find the smallest number by which 9408 must be divided so that the\nquotient is a perfect square.

(Why?)\nTherefore, the required smallest number is 3.\nAnd, 3136  =2 × 2 × 2 × 7 = 56.\nExample 8:  Find the smallest square number which is divisible by each of the numbers\n6, 9 and 15.\nSolution : This has to be done in two steps. First find the smallest common multiple and\nthen find the square number needed. The least number divisible by each one of 6, 9 and\n15 is their LCM. The LCM of 6, 9 and 15 is 2 × 3 × 3 × 5 = 90.Prime factorisation of 90 is 90 = 2 × \n3 × 3  × 5.\nWe see that prime factors 2 and 5 are not in pairs. Therefore 90 is not a perfect\nsquare.\nIn order to get a perfect square, each factor of 90 must be paired. So we need to\nmake pairs of 2 and 5. Therefore, 90 should be multiplied by 2 × 5, i.e., 10.Hence, the required square number is 90 × 10 = 900.\nEXERCISE 5.3\n1.What could be the possible ‘one’ s’ digits of the square root of each of the following\nnumbers?\n(i)9801 (ii)99856 (iii) 998001 (iv) 657666025\n2.Without doing any calculation, find the numbers which are surely not perfect squares.\n(i)153 (ii)257 (iii) 408 (iv)  441\n3.Find the square roots of 100 and 169 by the method of repeated subtraction.\n4.Find the square roots of the following numbers by the Prime Factorisation Method.\n(i)729 (ii)400 (iii) 1764 (iv) 4096\n(v)7744 (vi) 9604 (vii) 5929 (viii) 9216\n(ix) 529 (x)8100\n5.For each of the following numbers, find the smallest whole number by which it shouldbe multiplied so as to get a perfect square number .

Find the smallest square number that is divisible by each of the numbers 8, 15 and 20.\n5.5.4  Finding square root by division method\nWhen the numbers are large, even the method of finding square root by prime factorisation\nbecomes lengthy and dif ficult. To overcome this problem we use Long Division Method.\nFor this we need to determine the number of digits in the square root.See the following table:\nNumber Square\n10 100 which is the smallest 3-digit perfect square\n31 961 which is the greatest 3-digit perfect square\n32 1024 which is the smallest 4-digit perfect square\n99 9801 which is the greatest 4-digit perfect square\nSo, what can we say about the number of digits in the square root if a perfect\nsquare is a 3-digit or a 4-digit number? W e can say that, if a perfect square is a\n3-digit or a 4-digit number, then its square root will have 2-digits.\nCan you tell the number of digits in the square root of a 5-digit or a 6-digit\nperfect square?\nThe smallest 3-digit perfect square number is 100 which is the square of 10 and the\ngreatest 3-digit perfect square number is 961 which is the square of 31. The smallest\n4-digit square number is 1024 which is the square of 32 and the greatest 4-digit number is9801 which is the square of 99.\nCan we say that if a perfect square is of n-digits, then its square root will have \n2n\ndigits if n is even or ( 1)\n2n+ if n is odd?\nThe use of the number of digits in square root of a number is useful in the following method:\n•Consider the following steps to find the square root of 529.\nCan you estimate the number of digits in the square root of this number?\nStep 1 Place a bar over every pair of digits starting from the digit at one’s place. If the\nnumber of digits in it is odd, then the left-most single digit too will have a bar .\nThus we have, 529.\nStep 2 Find the largest number whose square is less than or equal to the number under the\nextreme left bar (22 < 5 < 32). Take this number as the divisor and the quotient\nwith the number under the extreme left  bar as the dividend  (here 5) . Divide and\nget the remainder (1 in this case).2\n2529\n– 4\n1\nReprint 2024-25\n\n\nStep 3 Bring down the number under the next bar (i.e., 29 in this case) to the right of\nthe remainder. So the new dividend is 129.\nStep 4 Double the quotient and enter it with a blank on its right.\nStep 5 Guess a largest possible digit to fill the blank which will also become the newdigit in the quotient, such that when the new divisor is multiplied to the newquotient the product is less than or equal to the dividend.\nIn this case 42 × 2 = 84.\nAs 43 × 3 = 129 so we choose the new digit as 3. Get the remainder .\nStep 6 Since the remainder is 0 and no digits are left in the given number, therefore,\n529 = 23.\n•Now consider 4096\nStep 1 Place a bar over every pair of digits starting from the one’ s digit. ( 40 96 ).\nStep 2 Find the largest number whose square is less than or equal to the number under\nthe left-most bar (62 < 40 < 72). Take this number as the divisor and the number\nunder the left-most bar as the dividend. Divide and get the remainder i.e., 4 inthis case.\nStep 3 Bring down the number under the next bar  (i.e., 96) to the right of the remainder .\nThe new dividend is 496.\nStep 4 Double the quotient and enter it with a blank on its right.\nStep 5 Guess a largest possible digit to fill the blank which also becomes the new digit in thequotient such that when the new digit is multiplied to the new quotient the product isless than or equal to the dividend. In this case we see that 124 × 4 = 496.\nSo the new digit in the quotient is 4. Get the remainder .\nStep 6 Since the remainder is 0 and no bar left, therefore, \n4096  = 64.\nEstimating the numberWe use bars to find the number of digits in the square root of a perfect square number .\n529 = 23          and         4096 = 64\nIn both the numbers 529 and 4096 there are two bars and the number of digits in their\nsquare root is 2. Can you tell the number of digits in the square root of 14400?\nBy placing bars we get 14400 . Since there are 3 bars, the square root will be of 3 digit.2\n2529\n– 4\n129\n        6\n6      4096\n     – 36\n          423\n2 529\n– 4\n43 129\n–129\n    02\n2 529\n– 4\n4_ 1 29\n6 4\n6     4096\n        – 36\n124       496\n          – 496\n0        6\n6      4096\n– 36\n           496\n 6\n    6      4096\n          – 36\n  12_       496\nReprint 2024-25\n\n\nTRY THESE\nWithout calculating square roots, find the number of digits in the square root of the\nfollowing numbers.\n(i)25600 (ii)100000000 (iii) 36864\nExample  9: Find the square root of : (i) 729 (ii) 1296\nSolution :\n(i) (ii)\nExample 10:  Find the least number that must be subtracted from 5607 so as to get\na perfect square. Also find the square root of the perfect square.\nSolution : Let us try to find 5607  by long division method. We get the\nremainder 131. It shows that 742 is less than 5607 by 131.\nThis means if we subtract the remainder from the number, we get a perfect square.\nTherefore, the required perfect square is 5607 – 131 = 5476.  And, 5476  =  74.\nExample 11:Find the greatest 4-digit number which is a perfect square.\nSolution:  Greatest number of 4-digits = 9999. W e find 9999  by long division\nmethod. The remainder is 198. This shows 992 is less than 9999 by 198.\nThis means if we subtract the remainder from the number, we get a perfect square.\nTherefore, the required perfect square is 9999 – 198 = 9801.\nAnd,  9801  = 99\nExample  12: Find the least number that must be added to 1300 so as to get a\nperfect square. Also find the square root of the perfect square.\nSolution : We find 1300  by long division method. The remainder is 4.\nThis shows that 362 < 1300.\nNext perfect square number is 372 = 1369.\nHence, the number to be added is 372 – 1300 = 1369 – 1300 = 69.\n5.6  Square Roots of Decimals\nConsider 17.64\nStep 1 To find the square root of a decimal number we put bars on the integral part\n(i.e., 17) of the number in the usual manner .

Proceed\nas usual. We get 17.64 .\nStep 2 Now proceed in a similar manner . The left most bar is on 17 and 42 < 17 < 52.\nTake this number as the divisor and the number under the left-most bar as the\ndividend, i.e., 17. Divide and get the remainder .\nStep 3 The remainder is 1. Write the number under the next bar (i.e., 64) to the right of\nthis remainder , to get 164.\nStep 4 Double the divisor and enter it with a blank on its right.\nSince 64 is the decimal part so put a decimal point in the\nquotient.\nStep 5 We know 82 × 2 = 164, therefore, the new digit is 2.Divide and get the remainder .\nStep 6 Since the remainder is 0 and no bar left, therefore \n17.64 4.2 = .\nExample  13: Find the square root of 12.25.\nSolution:\nWhich way to move\nConsider a number 176.341. Put bars on both integral part and decimal part. In what way\nis putting bars on decimal part different from integral part? Notice for 176 we start fromthe unit’ s place close to the decimal and move towards left. The first bar is over 76 and the\nsecond bar over 1. For .341, we start from the decimal and move towards right. First bar\nis over 34 and for the second bar we put 0 after 1 and make \n.3410 .\nExample 14: Area of a square plot is 2304 m2. Find the side of the square plot.\nSolution : Area of square plot = 2304 m2\nTherefore, side of the square plot = 2304 m\nWe find that, 2304  =48\nThus, the side of the square plot is 48 m.\nExample 15: There are 2401 students in a school.
