      "content": "CHAPTER 6\nLINES AND ANGLES\n6.1 Introduction\nIn Chapter 5, you have studied that a minimum of two points are required to draw a\nline. You have also studied some axioms and, with the help of these axioms, you\nproved some other statements. In this chapter , you will study the properties of the\nangles formed when two lines intersect each other , and also the properties of the\nangles formed when a line intersects two or more parallel lines at distinct points.\nFurther you will use these properties to prove some statements using deductive reasoning\n(see Appendix 1). You have already verified these statements through some activities\nin the earlier classes.\nIn your daily life, you see different types of angles formed between the edges of\nplane surfaces. For making a similar kind of model using the plane surfaces, you need\nto have a thorough knowledge of angles. For instance, suppose you want to make a\nmodel of a hut to keep in the school exhibition using bamboo sticks. Imagine how you\nwould make it? You would keep some of the sticks parallel to each other , and some\nsticks would be kept slanted. Whenever an architect has to draw a plan for a multistoried\nbuilding, she has to draw intersecting lines and parallel lines at dif ferent angles. Without\nthe knowledge of the properties of these lines and angles, do you think she can draw\nthe layout of the building?\nIn science, you study the properties of light by drawing the ray diagrams.\nFor example, to study the refraction property of light when it enters from one medium\nto the other medium, you use the properties of intersecting lines and parallel lines.\nWhen two or more forces act on a body , you draw the diagram in which forces are\nrepresented by directed line segments to study the net effect of the forces on the\nbody . At that time, you need to know the relation between the angles when the rays\n(or line segments) are parallel to or intersect each other . To find the height of a tower\nor to find the distance of a ship from the light house, one needs to know the angle\nReprint 2025-26\n\n70 MATHEMA TICS\nformed between the horizontal and the line of sight. Plenty of other examples can be\ngiven where lines and angles are used. In the subsequent chapters of geometry , you\nwill be using these properties of lines and angles to deduce more and more useful\nproperties.\nLet us first revise the terms and definitions related to lines and angles learnt in\nearlier classes.\n6.2 Basic Terms and Definitions\nRecall that a part (or portion) of a line with two end points is called a line-segment\nand a part of a line with one end point is called a ray. Note that the line segment AB is\ndenoted by AB, and its length is denoted by AB. The ray AB is denoted by AB\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002, and\na line is denoted by AB\u0003\u0001\u0001\u0002. However , we will not use these symbols , and will denote\nthe line segment AB, ray AB, length AB and line AB by the same symbol, AB. The\nmeaning will be clear from the context. Sometimes small letters l, m, n, etc. will be\nused to denote lines.\nIf three or more points lie on the same line, they are called collinear points ;\notherwise they are called non-collinear points .\nRecall that an angle is formed when two rays originate from the same end point.\nThe rays making an angle are called the arms  of the angle and the end point is called\nthe vertex of the angle. You have studied dif ferent types of angles, such as acute\nangle, right angle, obtuse angle, straight angle and reflex angle in earlier classes\n(see Fig. 6.1).\n(i) acute angle : 0° < x < 90° (ii) right angle : y = 90° (iii) obtuse angle : 90° < z < 180°\n(iv) straight angle : s = 180° (v) reflex angle : 180° < t < 360°\nFig. 6.1 : Types of Angles\nReprint 2025-26\n\nLINES AND ANGLES 71\nAn acute angle measures between 0° and 90°, whereas a right  angle is exactly\nequal to 90°. An angle greater than 90° but less than 180° is called an obtuse angle .\nAlso, recall that a straight angle is equal to 180°. An angle which is greater than 180°\nbut less than 360° is called a reflex angle . Further , two angles whose sum is 90° are\ncalled complementary angles , and two angles whose sum is 180° are called\nsupplementary angles .\nYou have also studied about adjacent angles\nin the earlier classes (see Fig. 6.2). Two angles\nare adjacent , if they have a common vertex, a\ncommon arm and their non-common arms are\non different sides of the common arm. In\nFig. 6.2, ∠ ABD and ∠ DBC are adjacent\nangles. Ray BD is their common arm and point\nB is their common vertex. Ray BA and ray BC\nare non common arms. Moreover , when two\nangles are adjacent, then their sum is always\nequal to the angle formed by the two non-\ncommon arms. So, we can write\n∠ ABC = ∠ ABD + ∠ DBC.\nNote that ∠ ABC and ∠ ABD are not\nadjacent angles. Why? Because their non-\ncommon arms BD and BC lie on the same side\nof the common arm BA.\nIf the non-common arms BA and BC in\nFig. 6.2, form a line then it will look like Fig. 6.3.\nIn this case, ∠ ABD and ∠ DBC are called\nlinear pair of angles .\nYou may also recall the vertically opposite\nangles  formed when two lines, say AB and CD,\nintersect each other , say at the point O\n(see Fig. 6.4). There are two pairs of vertically\nopposite angles.\nOne pair is ∠AOD and ∠BOC. Can you\nfind the other pair?Fig. 6.2 : Adjacent angles\nFig. 6.3 : Linear pair of angles\nFig. 6.4 : Vertically opposite\nangles\nReprint 2025-26\n\n72 MATHEMA TICS\n6.3 Intersecting Lines and Non-intersecting Lines\nDraw two dif ferent lines PQ and RS on a paper . You will see that you can draw them\nin two different ways as shown in Fig. 6.5 (i) and Fig. 6.5 (ii).\n(i) Intersecting lines (ii) Non-intersecting (parallel) lines\nFig. 6.5 : Different ways of drawing two lines\nRecall the notion of a line, that it extends indefinitely in both directions. Lines PQ\nand RS in Fig. 6.5 (i) are intersecting lines and in Fig. 6.5 (ii) are parallel lines. Note\nthat the lengths of the common perpendiculars at different points on these parallel\nlines is the same. This equal length is called the distance between two parallel lines .\n6.4 Pairs of Angles\nIn Section 6.2, you have learnt the definitions of\nsome of the pairs of angles such as\ncomplementary angles, supplementary angles,\nadjacent angles, linear pair of angles, etc. Can\nyou think of some relations between these\nangles? Now , let us find out the relation between\nthe angles formed when a ray stands on a line.\nDraw a figure in which a ray stands on a line as\nshown in Fig. 6.6. Name the line as AB and the\nray as OC. What are the angles formed at the\npoint O? They are ∠ AOC, ∠ BOC and ∠ AOB.\nCan we write ∠ AOC + ∠ BOC = ∠ AOB? (1)\nYes! (Why? Refer to adjacent angles in Section 6.2)\nWhat is the measure of ∠ AOB? It is 180°. (Why?) (2)\nFrom (1) and (2), can you say that ∠ AOC + ∠ BOC = 180°? Yes! (Why?)\nFrom the above discussion, we can state the following Axiom:Fig. 6.6 : Linear pair of angles\nReprint 2025-26\n\nLINES AND ANGLES 73\nAxiom 6.1 :  If a ray stands on a line, then the sum of two adjacent angles so\nformed is 180°.\nRecall that when the sum of two adjacent angles is 180°, then they are called a\nlinear pair of angles .\nIn Axiom 6.1, it is given that ‘a ray stands on a line’. From this ‘given’, we have\nconcluded that ‘the sum of two adjacent angles so formed is 180°’. Can we write\nAxiom 6.1 the other way? That is, take the ‘conclusion’  of Axiom 6.1 as ‘given’  and\nthe ‘given’ as the ‘conclusion’. So it becomes:\n(A) If the sum of two adjacent angles is 180°, then a ray stands on a line (that is,\nthe non-common arms form a line).\nNow you see that the Axiom 6.1 and statement (A) are in a sense the reverse of\neach others. We call each as converse of the other . We do not know whether the\nstatement (A) is true or not. Let us check. Draw adjacent angles of different measures\nas shown in Fig. 6.7. Keep the ruler along one of the non-common arms in each case.\nDoes the other non-common arm also lie along the ruler?\nFig. 6.7 : Adjacent angles with dif ferent measur es\nReprint 2025-26\n\n74 MATHEMA TICS\nYou will find that only in Fig. 6.7 (iii), both the non-common arms lie along the\nruler, that is, points A, O and B lie on the same line and ray OC stands on it. Also see\nthat ∠ AOC + ∠ COB = 125° + 55° = 180°. From this, you may conclude that statement\n(A) is true. So, you can state in the form of an axiom as follows:\nAxiom 6.2 :  If the sum of two adjacent angles is 180°,  then the non-common arms\nof the angles form a line .\nFor obvious reasons, the two axioms above together is called the Linear Pair\nAxiom .\nLet us now examine the case when two lines intersect each other .\nRecall, from earlier classes,  that when two lines intersect, the vertically opposite\nangles are equal. Let us prove this result now . See Appendix 1 for the ingredients of a\nproof, and keep those in mind while studying the proof given below .\nTheor em 6.1 :  If two lines intersect each other , then the ver tically opposite\nangles ar e equal .\nProof :  In the statement above, it is given\nthat ‘two lines intersect each other ’. So, let\nAB and CD be two lines intersecting at O as\nshown in Fig. 6.8. They lead to two pairs of\nvertically opposite angles, namely ,\n(i) ∠ AOC and ∠ BOD (ii) ∠ AOD and\n∠ BOC.\nWe need to prove that ∠ AOC = ∠ BOD\nand ∠ AOD = ∠ BOC.\nNow , ray OA  stands on line CD.\nTherefore, ∠ AOC + ∠ AOD = 180° (Linear pair axiom) (1)\nCan we write ∠ AOD + ∠ BOD = 180°? Yes! (Why?) (2)\nFrom (1) and (2), we can write\n                                  ∠ AOC + ∠ AOD = ∠ AOD + ∠ BOD\nThis implies that ∠ AOC = ∠ BOD (Refer Section 5.2, Axiom 3)\nSimilarly , it can be proved that ∠AOD = ∠BOC\nNow , let us do some examples based on Linear Pair Axiom and Theorem 6.1.Fig. 6.8 : Vertically opposite angles\nReprint 2025-26\n\nLINES AND ANGLES 75\nFig. 6.9Example 1 : In Fig. 6.9, lines PQ and RS\nintersect each other at point O. If\n∠ POR : ∠ ROQ = 5 : 7, find all the angles.\nSolution : ∠ POR + ∠ ROQ = 180°\n(Linear pair of angles)\nBut ∠ POR : ∠ ROQ = 5 : 7\n(Given)\nTherefore, ∠ POR =5\n12 × 180° = 75°\nSimilarly , ∠ ROQ =7\n12 × 180° = 105°\nNow, ∠ POS = ∠ROQ = 105° (Vertically opposite angles)\nand ∠ SOQ = ∠POR = 75° (Vertically opposite angles)\nExample 2 :  In Fig. 6.10, ray OS stands on a line POQ. Ray OR and ray OT are\nangle bisectors of ∠ POS and ∠ SOQ, respectively . If ∠ POS = x, find ∠ ROT .\nSolution :  Ray OS stands on the line POQ.\nTherefore, ∠ POS + ∠ SOQ = 180°\nBut, ∠ POS = x\nTherefore, x + ∠ SOQ = 180°\nSo, ∠ SOQ = 180° – x\nNow , ray OR bisects ∠ POS, therefore,\n∠ ROS =1\n2 × ∠ POS\n=1\n2 × x = 2x\nSimilarly , ∠ SOT =1\n2 × ∠ SOQ\n=1\n2 × (180° – x)\n=902x° −Fig. 6.10\nReprint 2025-26\n\n76 MATHEMA TICS\nNow, ∠ ROT = ∠ ROS + ∠ SOT\n= 90 –2 2x x+ °\n=90°\nExample 3 :  In Fig. 6.1 1, OP , OQ, OR and OS are\nfour rays. Prove that ∠ POQ + ∠ QOR + ∠ SOR +\n∠ POS = 360°.\nSolution :  In Fig. 6.1 1, you need to produce any of\nthe rays OP , OQ, OR or OS backwards to a point.\nLet us produce ray OQ backwards to a point T so\nthat TOQ is a line (see Fig. 6.12).\nNow , ray OP  stands on line TOQ.\nTherefore, ∠ TOP + ∠ POQ = 180° (1)\n(Linear pair axiom)\nSimilarly , ray OS stands on line TOQ.\nTherefore, ∠ TOS + ∠ SOQ = 180° (2)\nBut ∠ SOQ = ∠ SOR + ∠ QOR\nSo, (2) becomes\n∠ TOS + ∠ SOR + ∠ QOR = 180° (3)\nNow , adding (1) and (3), you get\n∠ TOP + ∠ POQ + ∠ TOS + ∠ SOR + ∠ QOR = 360° (4)\nBut ∠ TOP + ∠ TOS = ∠ POS\nTherefore, (4) becomes\n∠ POQ + ∠ QOR + ∠ SOR + ∠ POS = 360°\nEXERCISE 6.1\n1.In Fig. 6.13, lines AB and CD intersect at O.

Let us\ncheck it. See Fig. 6.18 in which line m || line l and line n || line l.\nLet us draw a line t transversal for the lines, l, m and n. It is given that\nline m || line l and line n || line l.\nTherefore, ∠ 1 = ∠ 2and ∠ 1 = ∠ 3\n(Corresponding angles axiom)\nSo, ∠ 2 = ∠ 3 (Why?)\nBut ∠ 2 and ∠ 3 are corresponding angles and they\nare equal.\nTherefore, you can say that\nLine m || Line n\n(Converse of corresponding angles axiom)\nThis result can be stated in the form of the following theorem:\nTheor em 6.6 :  Lines which ar e parallel to the same line ar e parallel to each\nother .\nNote : The property above can be extended to more than two lines also.\nNow , let us solve some examples related to parallel lines.\nExample 4 :  In Fig. 6.19, if PQ || RS, ∠ MXQ = 135° and ∠ MYR = 40°, find ∠ XMY .\nFig. 6.19 Fig. 6.20\nSolution :  Here, we need to draw a line AB parallel to line PQ, through point M as\nshown in Fig. 6.20. Now , AB || PQ and PQ || RS.Fig. 6.18\nReprint 2025-26\n\nLINES AND ANGLES 79\nTherefore, AB || RS (Why?)\nNow, ∠ QXM + ∠  XMB = 180°\n (AB || PQ, Interior angles on the same side of the transversal XM)\nBut ∠ QXM = 135°\nSo, 135° + ∠ XMB = 180°\nTherefore, ∠ XMB = 45°  (1)\nNow, ∠ BMY = ∠ MYR  (AB || RS, Alternate angles)\nTherefore, ∠ BMY = 40°  (2)\nAdding (1) and (2), you get\n∠ XMB + ∠ BMY = 45° + 40°\nThat is, ∠ XMY = 85°\nExample 5 :  If a transversal intersects two lines such that the bisectors of a pair of\ncorresponding angles are parallel, then prove that the two lines are parallel.\nSolution :  In Fig. 6.21, a transversal AD intersects two lines PQ and RS at points B\nand C respectively . Ray BE is the bisector of ∠ ABQ and ray CG is the bisector of\n∠ BCS; and BE || CG.\nWe are to prove that PQ || RS.\nIt is given that ray BE is the bisector of ∠ ABQ.\nTherefore, ∠ ABE =1\n2 ∠ ABQ  (1)\nSimilarly , ray CG is the bisector of ∠ BCS.\nTherefore, ∠ BCG =1\n2 ∠ BCS  (2)\nBut BE || CG and AD is the transversal.\nTherefore, ∠ ABE = ∠ BCG\n            (Corresponding angles axiom)  (3)\nSubstituting (1) and (2) in (3), you get\n1\n2 ∠ ABQ =1\n2 ∠ BCS\nThat is, ∠ ABQ = ∠ BCSFig. 6.21\nReprint 2025-26\n\n80 MATHEMA TICS\nBut, they are the corresponding angles formed by transversal AD with PQ and RS;\nand are equal.\nTherefore, PQ || RS\n(Converse of corresponding angles axiom)\nExample 6 :  In Fig. 6.22, AB || CD and CD || EF . Also EA  ⊥ AB. If ∠ BEF = 55°, find\nthe values of x, y and z.\nSolution : y + 55° = 180°\n(Interior angles on the same side of the\ntransversal ED)\nTherefore, y =180º – 55º = 125º\nAgain x =y\n (AB || CD, Corresponding angles axiom)\nTherefore x =125º\nNow , since AB || CD and CD || EF , therefore, AB || EF .\nSo, ∠ EAB + ∠ FEA = 180° (Interior angles on the same\nside of the transversal EA)\nTherefore, 90° + z + 55° = 180°\nWhich gives z =35°\nEXERCISE 6.2\n1.In Fig. 6.23, if AB || CD, CD || EF and y : z = 3 : 7,\nfind x.\nFig. 6.23Fig. 6.22\nReprint 2025-26\n\nLINES AND ANGLES 81\n2.In Fig. 6.24, if AB || CD, EF ⊥ CD and ∠ GED = 126°, find ∠ AGE, ∠ GEF and ∠ FGE.\nFig. 6.24\n3.In Fig. 6.25, if PQ || ST , ∠ PQR = 1 10° and ∠ RST  = 130°, find ∠ QRS.\n[Hint : Draw a line parallel to ST through point R .]\nFig. 6.25\n4.In Fig. 6.26, if AB || CD, ∠ APQ = 50° and ∠ PRD = 127°, find x and y.\nFig. 6.26\n5.In Fig. 6.27, PQ and RS are two mirrors placed parallel to each other .
