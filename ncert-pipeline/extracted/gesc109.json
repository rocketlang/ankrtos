The graph shownin Fig. 9.10 is an example of a line graph.\nThe distance-time graph is a line graph.Let us learn to make such a graph.Fig. 9.7  The dashboard of a car\nReprint 2024-25\n\nMOTION  AND TIME 101\nTable 9.6 The motion of a car\nS.

Draw\ntwo lines perpendicular to each other\non it, as shown in Fig. 9.11. Mark the\nhorizontal line as XOX'. It is known asthe x-axis. Similarly mark the vertical\nline YOY '. It is called the y-axis. The point\nof intersection of XOX ' and YOY ' is\nknown as the origin O. The twoquantities between which the graph is\ndrawn are shown along these two axes.We show the positive values on the\nx-axis along OX. Similarly, positive\nvalues on the y-axis are shown alongOY. In this chapter we shall consider\nonly the positive values of quantities.Therefore, we shall use only the shadedpart of the graph shown in Fig. 9.11.\nBoojho and Paheli found out the\ndistance travelled by a car and the timetaken by it to cover that distance. Their\ndata is shown in Table 9.6.\n2468 10 12 14 16 18 20 2220\n10304050607080Weight (in kg)\nAge (in year)X O X\nYY\nYou can make the graph by following\nthe steps given below:\nDraw two perpendicular lines to\nrepresent the two axes and markthem as OX and OY as in Fig. 9.11.\nDecide the quantity to be shownalong the x-axis and that to beshown along the y-axis. In this caseY\nXOther gases Oxygen\nNitrogen\nReprint 2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 102we show the time along the x-axis\nand the distance along the y-axis.\nChoose a scale to represent thedistance and another to representthe time on the graph. For the motionof the car scales could be\nTime: 1 min = 1 cm\nDistance: 1 km = 1 cm\nMark values for the time and thedistance on the respective axes\naccording to the scale you have\nchosen. For the motion of the carmark the time 1 min, 2 min, … onthe x-axis from the origin O.\nSimilarly, mark the distance 1 km,\n2 km … on the y-axis (Fig. 9.12).\nNow you have to mark the points onthe graph paper to represent each\nset of values for distance and time.\nObservation recorded at S. No. 1in Table 9.6 shows that at time0 min the distance moved is also\nzero. The point corresponding to this\nset of values on the graph willtherefore be the origin itself. After 1minute, the car has moved a distance\nof 1 km. To mark this set of values\nlook for the point that represents1 minute on the x-axis. Draw a lineparallel to the y-axis at this point.\nThen draw a line parallel to the\nx-axis from the point correspondingto distance 1 km on the y-axis. Thepoint where these two lines\nintersect represents this set of values\non the graph (Fig. 9.12). Similarly,mark on the graph paper thepoints corresponding to different\nsets of values.Fig. 9.12 shows the set of points onthe graph corresponding to positions\nof the car at various times.\nJoin all the points on the graph as\nshown in Fig. 9.13. It is a straight\nline. This is the distance-time graph\nfor the motion of the car.\nIf the distance-time graph is a\nstraight line, it indicates that the\nobject is moving with a constantspeed. However, if the speed of the\nobject keeps changing, the graph can\nbe of any other shape.Fig. 9.12  Making a graph\nFig. 9.13  Making a graphOXY\nXO\nY\nReprint 2024-25\n\nMOTION  AND TIME 103Generally, the choice of scales is not\nas simple as in the example given in\nFig. 9.12 and 9.13. We may have to\nchoose two different scales to represent\nthe desired quantities on the x-axis and\nthe y-axis. Let us try to understand this\nprocess with an example.\nLet us again consider the motion of\nthe bus that took Paheli and her friends\nto the picnic. The distance covered and\ntime taken by the bus are shown inTable 9.5. The total distance covered bythe bus is 80 km. If we decide to choose\na scale 1 km = 1 cm, we shall have to\ndraw an axis of length 80 cm. This isnot possible on a sheet of paper. On theother hand, a scale 10 km = 1 cm would\nrequire an axis of length only 8 cm. This\nscale is quite convenient. However, thegraph may cover only a small part ofthe graph paper.  Some of the points to\nbe kept in mind while choosing\nthe most suitable scale for drawing a\ngraph are:the difference between the highest\nand the lowest values of eachquantity.\nthe intermediate values of eachquantity, so that with the scalechosen it is convenient to mark the\nvalues on the graph, and\nto utilise the maximum part of the\npaper on which the graph is to be\ndrawn.\nSuppose that you are given a graph\npaper of size 25 cm  × 25 cm. One of the\nscales which meets the above conditionsand can accommodate the data of Table9.5 could be\nDistance: 5 km = 1 cm, andTime: 6 min = 1 cmCan you now draw the distance-time\ngraph for the motion of the bus? Is thegraph drawn by you similar to thatshown in Fig. 9.13?\nDistance-time graphs provide a\nvariety of information about the motionFig. 9.14  Distance-time graph of the busY\nX\nReprint 2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 104when compared to the data presented\nby a table. For example, Table 9.5 givesinformation about the distance moved\nby the bus only at some definite time\nintervals. On the other hand, from thedistance-time graph we can find the\ndistance moved by the bus at any\ninstant of time. Suppose we want toknow how much distance the bus had\ntravelled at 8:15  AM. We mark the point\ncorresponding to the time (8:15 AM) on\nthe x-axis (Fig. 9.14). Suppose this point\nis A.  Next we draw a line perpendicular\nto the x-axis (or parallel to the y-axis) atpoint A. We then mark the point, T, onthe graph at which this perpendicularline intersects it (Fig. 9.14). Next, we\ndraw a line through the point T parallel\nto the x-axis. This intersects the y-axisat the point B. The distance\ncorresponding to the point B on the y-\naxis, OB, gives us the distance in kmcovered by the bus at 8:15  AM. How\nmuch is this distance in km? Can younow help Paheli to find the distancemoved by the bus at 9:45  AM? Can you\nalso find the speed of the bus from itsdistance-time graph?\nBar graph\nGraphsNon-uniform motionKeywords\nOscillationSimple pendulumSpeedTime periodUniform motionUnit of time\nWhat you have Learnt\nThe distance moved by an object in a unit time is called its speed.\nSpeed of objects help us to decide which one is moving faster than the\nother.\nThe speed of an object is the distance travelled divided by the time takento cover that distance.

Calculate the speed of the train.\n5. The odometer of a car reads 57321.0 km when the clock shows the time\n08:30 AM. What is the distance moved by the car, if at 08:50 AM, the\nodometer reading has changed to 57336.0 km? Calculate the speed ofthe car in km/min during this time. Express the speed in km/h also.\n",

It is called the y-axis. The point\nof intersection of XOX ' and YOY ' is\nknown as the origin O. The twoquantities between which the graph is\ndrawn are shown along these two axes.We show the positive values on the\nx-axis along OX. Similarly, positive\nvalues on the y-axis are shown alongOY. In this chapter we shall consider\nonly the positive values of quantities.Therefore, we shall use only the shadedpart of the graph shown in Fig. 9.11.\nBoojho and Paheli found out the\ndistance travelled by a car and the timetaken by it to cover that distance. Their\ndata is shown in Table 9.6.\n2468 10 12 14 16 18 20 2220\n10304050607080Weight (in kg)\nAge (in year)X O X\nYY\nYou can make the graph by following\nthe steps given below:\nDraw two perpendicular lines to\nrepresent the two axes and markthem as OX and OY as in Fig. 9.11.\nDecide the quantity to be shownalong the x-axis and that to beshown along the y-axis. In this caseY\nXOther gases Oxygen\nNitrogen\nReprint 2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 102we show the time along the x-axis\nand the distance along the y-axis.\nChoose a scale to represent thedistance and another to representthe time on the graph. For the motionof the car scales could be\nTime: 1 min = 1 cm\nDistance: 1 km = 1 cm\nMark values for the time and thedistance on the respective axes\naccording to the scale you have\nchosen. For the motion of the carmark the time 1 min, 2 min, … onthe x-axis from the origin O.\nSimilarly, mark the distance 1 km,\n2 km … on the y-axis (Fig. 9.12).\nNow you have to mark the points onthe graph paper to represent each\nset of values for distance and time.\nObservation recorded at S. No. 1in Table 9.6 shows that at time0 min the distance moved is also\nzero. The point corresponding to this\nset of values on the graph willtherefore be the origin itself. After 1minute, the car has moved a distance\nof 1 km. To mark this set of values\nlook for the point that represents1 minute on the x-axis. Draw a lineparallel to the y-axis at this point.\nThen draw a line parallel to the\nx-axis from the point correspondingto distance 1 km on the y-axis. Thepoint where these two lines\nintersect represents this set of values\non the graph (Fig. 9.12). Similarly,mark on the graph paper thepoints corresponding to different\nsets of values.Fig. 9.12 shows the set of points onthe graph corresponding to positions\nof the car at various times.\nJoin all the points on the graph as\nshown in Fig. 9.13. It is a straight\nline. This is the distance-time graph\nfor the motion of the car.\nIf the distance-time graph is a\nstraight line, it indicates that the\nobject is moving with a constantspeed. However, if the speed of the\nobject keeps changing, the graph can\nbe of any other shape.Fig. 9.12  Making a graph\nFig. 9.13  Making a graphOXY\nXO\nY\nReprint 2024-25\n\nMOTION  AND TIME 103Generally, the choice of scales is not\nas simple as in the example given in\nFig. 9.12 and 9.13. We may have to\nchoose two different scales to represent\nthe desired quantities on the x-axis and\nthe y-axis. Let us try to understand this\nprocess with an example.\nLet us again consider the motion of\nthe bus that took Paheli and her friends\nto the picnic. The distance covered and\ntime taken by the bus are shown inTable 9.5. The total distance covered bythe bus is 80 km. If we decide to choose\na scale 1 km = 1 cm, we shall have to\ndraw an axis of length 80 cm. This isnot possible on a sheet of paper. On theother hand, a scale 10 km = 1 cm would\nrequire an axis of length only 8 cm. This\nscale is quite convenient. However, thegraph may cover only a small part ofthe graph paper.  Some of the points to\nbe kept in mind while choosing\nthe most suitable scale for drawing a\ngraph are:the difference between the highest\nand the lowest values of eachquantity.\nthe intermediate values of eachquantity, so that with the scalechosen it is convenient to mark the\nvalues on the graph, and\nto utilise the maximum part of the\npaper on which the graph is to be\ndrawn.\nSuppose that you are given a graph\npaper of size 25 cm  × 25 cm. One of the\nscales which meets the above conditionsand can accommodate the data of Table9.5 could be\nDistance: 5 km = 1 cm, andTime: 6 min = 1 cmCan you now draw the distance-time\ngraph for the motion of the bus? Is thegraph drawn by you similar to thatshown in Fig. 9.13?\nDistance-time graphs provide a\nvariety of information about the motionFig. 9.14  Distance-time graph of the busY\nX\nReprint 2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 104when compared to the data presented\nby a table. For example, Table 9.5 givesinformation about the distance moved\nby the bus only at some definite time\nintervals. On the other hand, from thedistance-time graph we can find the\ndistance moved by the bus at any\ninstant of time. Suppose we want toknow how much distance the bus had\ntravelled at 8:15  AM. We mark the point\ncorresponding to the time (8:15 AM) on\nthe x-axis (Fig. 9.14). Suppose this point\nis A.  Next we draw a line perpendicular\nto the x-axis (or parallel to the y-axis) atpoint A. We then mark the point, T, onthe graph at which this perpendicularline intersects it (Fig. 9.14). Next, we\ndraw a line through the point T parallel\nto the x-axis. This intersects the y-axisat the point B. The distance\ncorresponding to the point B on the y-\naxis, OB, gives us the distance in kmcovered by the bus at 8:15  AM. How\nmuch is this distance in km? Can younow help Paheli to find the distancemoved by the bus at 9:45  AM? Can you\nalso find the speed of the bus from itsdistance-time graph?\nBar graph\nGraphsNon-uniform motionKeywords\nOscillationSimple pendulumSpeedTime periodUniform motionUnit of time\nWhat you have Learnt\nThe distance moved by an object in a unit time is called its speed.\nSpeed of objects help us to decide which one is moving faster than the\nother.\nThe speed of an object is the distance travelled divided by the time takento cover that distance.

You can make your own sundial and use it to mark the time of the day\nat your place. First of all find the latitude of your city with the help of an\natlas. Cut out a triangular piece of a cardboard such that its one angleis equal to the latitude of your place and the angle opposite to it is aright angle. Fix this piece, called gnomon , vertically along a diameter of\na circular board a shown in Fig. 9.16. One way to fix the gnomon couldbe to make a groove along a diameter on the circular board.\nNext, select an open space, which receives sunlight for most of the day.\nMark a line on the ground along the North-South direction. Place thesundial in the sun as shown in Fig. 9.16.  Mark the position of the tip ofthe shadow of the gnomon on the circular board as early in the day aspossible, say 8:00 AM . Mark the position of the tip of the shadow every\nhour throughout the day. Draw lines to connect each point marked byyou with the centre of the base of the gnomon as shown in Fig. 9.16.Extend the lines on the circular board up to its periphery. You can usethis sundial to read the time of the day at your place. Remember thatthe gnomon should always be placed in the North-South direction asshown in Fig. 9.16.\nFig. 9.16(iii) (iv)\nReprint 2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 108Did you know?\nThe time-keeping services in India are provided by the National Physical\nLaboratory, New Delhi.
