Here, we\nshall discuss the role that hormones play\nin bringing about changes that make a\nchild grow into an adult.\n7.1 Adolescence and Puberty\nBoojho was celebrating his 12th\nbirthday. After his friends left, Boojho\nand Paheli began chatting with their\nparents. Paheli studies in an all-girls\nschool. She started laughing. She\nremarked that many of Boojho’s  school\nfriends, whom she met after a year , had\nsuddenly shot up in height. Some of\nthem were looking very funny with a\nhairy line above their lips. Her mother\nexplained that the boys had grown up.\nGrowth begins from the day one is\nborn. But upon crossing the age of 10\nor 11, there is a sudden spurt in growth\nwhich becomes noticeable. The changes\ntaking place in the body are part of\ngrowing up. They indicate that you areI wonder how long this\nperiod marked by changes\nin the body will last!\nno longer  a child but are on the way to\nbecoming an adult.\nIt is a strange period of life\nwhen you are neither a child nor\nan adult. I wonder whether this\nperiod between childhood and\nadulthood had a special name!\nGrowing up is a natural process. The\nperiod of life, when the body undergoes\nchanges, leading to reproductive\nmaturity, is called adolescence.\nAdolescence begins around the age of\n11 and lasts upto 18 or 19 years of age.\nSince this period covers the ‘teens’ (13\nto 18 or 19 years of age), adolescents\nare also called ‘teenagers’. In girls,\nadolescence may begin a year or two\nearlier than in boys. Also, the period of\nadolescence  varies  from person to person.\nThe human body undergoes several\nchanges during adolescence. These\nchanges mark the onset of puberty . The\nmost important change which marks\npuberty is that boys and girls become\ncapable of reproduction. Puberty ends\nwhen an adolescent reaches reproductive\nmaturity.\nREACHING  THE AGE OF ADOLESCENCE REACHING  THE AGE OF ADOLESCENCE\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 80\n% of full height\nBoys Girls\n8 72% 77%\n9 75% 81%\n10 78% 84%\n11 81% 88%\n12 84% 91%\n13 88% 95%\n14 92% 98%\n15 95% 99%\n16 98% 99.5%\n17 99% 100%\n18 100% 100%Age in\nYearsPaheli and Boojho\nrealised that sudden\nincrease in height and\nhairy line above the lips\nin boys were signs of\nadolescence. They\nwanted to know more\nabout other changes at\npuberty.\n7.2 Changes at Puberty\nIncrease in Height\nThe most conspicuous change during\npuberty is the sudden increase in\nheight. At this time the long bones, that\nis, the bones of the arms and the legs\nelongate and make a person tall.\nActivity 7.1\nThe following chart gives the\naverage rate of growth in height of\nboys and girls with age. The figures\nin columns 2 and 3, give the\npercentage of the height a person\nhas reached at the age given in\ncolumn 1. For example, by the age\n11, a boy has reached 81% of his\nprobable full height, while a girl\nhas reached 88% of her full\nheight. These figures are only\nrepresentative and there may be\nindividual variations.\nUse the Table for your friends\nand work out how tall they are likely\nto be. Find out who is likely to beCalculation for full height (cm)\n( )100Presentheight cm\n%of fullheightatthisage×\n    (as given in the chart)\nExample:\nA boy is 9 years old and 120 cm\ntall. At the end of the growth period\nhe is likely to be\n×12010075 cm = 160 cm tallthe tallest and who might be the\nshortest in your class.\n2024-25\n\nREACHING  THE AGE OF ADOLESCENCE 81There is no need for Paheli to worry.\nAll parts of the body do not grow at the\nsame rate. Sometimes the arms and legs\nor hands and feet of adolescents look\noversized and out of proportion with the\nbody. But soon the other parts catch\nup and result in a proportionate body.\nYou must have noticed that height\nof an individual is more or less similar\nto that of some family member . This is\nbecause height depends on the genes\ninherited fr om par ents. It is, however ,\nvery important to eat the right kind of\nfood during these growing years. This\nhelps the bones, muscles and other\nparts of the body get adequate\nnourishment for gr owth. Y ou will find\nnutritional needs of adolescents\ndiscussed later in the lesson.\nChange in Body Shape\nHave you noticed that boys in your class\nhave broader shoulders and wider chests\nthan boys in  junior classes? This is\nbecause they have entered the age of\npuberty when shoulders generally\nbroaden as a result of growth. In girls,\nthe region below the waist becomes\nwider .\nIn boys, the muscles of the body grow\nmore prominently than in the girls.\nThus, changes occurring in adolescent\nboys and girls are different.\nVoice Change\nDid you notice that sometimes the voice\nof some of the boys in your class cracks?\nAt puberty, the voice box  or the larynx\nbegins to grow. Boys develop larger voice\nboxes. The growing voice box in boys can\nbe seen as a protruding part of the throatActivity 7.2\nUse the data given in Activity 7.1 to\ndraw a graph. Take age on the\nX-axis and per cent growth in height\non the Y-axis. Highlight the point\nrepresenting your age on the graph.\nFind out the percentage of height\nyou have already reached. Calculate\nthe height you might eventually\nreach. Tally your graph with the one\ngiven here (Fig. 7.1).\nFig. 7.1 : Graph showing percentage of height\nwith age\nI am worried. Though I\nhave become taller , my\nface looks much smaller\ncompared to my body.\nInitially, girls grow faster than boys\nbut by about 18 years of age, both reach\ntheir maximum height. The rate of\ngrowth in height varies in different\nindividuals. Some may grow suddenly\nat puberty and then slow down, while\nothers may grow gradually.\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 82and pimples on the face at this time\nbecause of the increased activity of these\nglands in the skin.\nDevelopment of Sex Organs\nLook up Fig. 6.1 and 6.3 of the\nprevious lesson which show sex\norgans of humans. At puberty, male\nsex organs like the testes and penis\ndevelop completely. The testes also\nbegin to produce sperms. In girls, the\novaries enlarge and eggs begin to\nmature. Also ovaries start releasing\nmature eggs.\nReaching Mental, Intellectual and\nEmotional Maturity\nAdolescence is also a period of change\nin a person’s way of thinking.\nAdolescents are more independent than\nbefore and are also self conscious.\nIntellectual development takes place and\nthey tend to spend considerable time\nthinking. In fact, it is often the time in\none’s life when the brain has the\ngreatest capacity for learning.\nSometimes, however , an adolescent may\nfeel insecure while trying to adjust to\nthe changes in the body and mind. But\nas adolescent learners, you should know\nthat there is no reason to feel insecure.\nThese changes are a natural part of\ngrowing up.\n7.3 Secondary Sexual\nCharacters\nYou have lear nt in Chapter 6, that\ntestes and ovaries are the reproductive\norgans. They produce the gametes,\nthat is, sperms and ova. In girls,\nbreasts begin to develop at pubertyMany of my classmates\nhave a hoarse voice. Now I\nknow why?\nFig. 7.2 : Adam’s apple in a grown up boycalled Adam’s apple  (Fig. 7.2). In girls,\nthe larynx is hardly visible from the\noutside because of its small size.\nGenerally, girls have a high pitched voice,\nwhereas boys have a deep voice. In\nadolescent boys, sometimes, the muscles\nof the growing voice box go out of control\nand the voice becomes hoarse. This state\nmay remain for a few days or weeks after\nwhich the voice becomes normal.\nA few glands such as sweat glands,\noil glands and salivary glands release\ntheir secretions through ducts.\nEndocrine glands release hormones\ndirectly into the bloodstream. So, they\nare also termed ductless glands.Increased Activity of Sweat and\nSebaceous Glands\nDuring puberty the secretion of sweat\nglands and sebaceous glands (oil glands)\nincreases. Many young people get acneAdam’s\napple\n2024-25\n\nREACHING  THE AGE OF ADOLESCENCE 83and boys begin to gr ow facial hair , that\nis, moustaches and beard. As these\nfeatures help to distinguish the male\nfrom the female they are called\nsecondary sexual characters . Boys\nalso develop hair on their chest. In\nboth, boys and girls, hair grows under\nthe arms and in the region above the\nthighs or the pubic region.\nPaheli and Boojho have now\nunderstood that puberty marks the\nbeginning of the reproductive period\nwhen one becomes capable of\nreproduction. But they want to know\nif reproductive life, once begun,\ncontinues, or it ends some time.The testes and ovaries secrete sex\nhormones. Y ou have just lear nt that\nthese hormones are responsible for the\nmale and female secondary sexual\ncharacters. Further , the sex hor mones\nare under the control of hormones from\nthe pituitary gland (Fig. 7.3). The\npituitary secretes many hormones, one\nof which makes ova mature in the\novaries and sperms form in the testes.\nBoth Boojho and Paheli wish to know\nwhat initiates changes at puberty.\nFig. 7.3 : The onset of puberty is controlled by\nhormonesThe changes which occur at\nadolescence are controlled by\nhormones. Hormones are chemical\nsubstances. These are secretions from\nendocrine glands , or endocrine system.\nThe male hormone or testosterone\nbegins to be released by the testes at\nthe onset of puberty. This causes\nchanges in boys about which you have\njust learnt, for example, the growth of\nfacial hair . Once puberty is r eached in\ngirls, ovaries begin to produce the female\nhormone\n or estrogen which makes the\nbreasts develop. Milk secreting glands\nor mammary glands develop inside the\nbreasts. The production of these\nhormones is under the control of\nanother hormone secreted from an\nendocrine gland called pituitary gland .\n7.4 Role of Hormones in\nInitiating Reproductive\nFunction\nEndocrine glands release hormones\ninto the bloodstream to reach a\nparticular body part called target site .\nThe target site responds to the\nhormone. There are many endocrine\nglands  or ductless glands in the body.\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 847.5 Reproductive Phase of\nLife in Humans\nAdolescents become capable of\nreproduction when their testes and\novaries begin to produce gametes. The\ncapacity for maturation  and production\nof gametes lasts for a much longer time\nin males than in females.\nIn females, the reproductive phase of\nlife begins at puberty (10 to 12 years of\nage) and generally lasts till the age of\napproximately 45 to 50 years. The ova\nbegin to mature with the onset of\npuberty. One ovum matures and is\nreleased by one of the ovaries once in\nabout 28 to 30 days. During this\nperiod, the wall of the uterus becomes\nthick so as to receive the egg, in case\nit is fertilised and begins to develop.\nThis results in pregnancy. If\nfertilisation does not occur , the\nreleased egg, and the thickened lining\nof the uterus along with its blood\nvessels are shed off. This causes\nbleeding in women which is called\nmenstruation . Menstruation occurs\nonce in about 28 to 30 days. The first\nmenstrual flow begins at puberty  and\nis termed menarche . At 45 to 50 years\nof age, the menstrual cycle stops.\nStoppage of menstruation is termed\nmenopause.  Initially, menstrual cycle\nmay be irr egular . It take some time to\nbecome r egular .Menstrual cycle is controlled by\nhormones. The cycle includes the\nmaturation of the egg, its release,\nthickening of uterine wall and its\nbreakdown if pregnancy does not\noccur . In case the egg is fertilised it\nbegins to divide and then gets\nembedded in the uterus for further\ndevelopment as you have learnt in\nChapter 6 (Fig. 6.8).\n7.6 How is the Sex of the\nBaby Determined?\nI heard my mother and my\naunt talking about my cousin\nwho is going to have a baby.\nThey were discussing whether\nshe would give birth to a boy\nor a girl. I wonder what makes\nthe fertilised egg develop\neither into a boy or a girl!\nPaheli says that the\nreproductive life of a\nwoman lasts from\nmenarche to menopause.\nIs she right?Boy or Girl?\nInside the fertilised egg or zygote is the\ninstruction for determining the sex of\nthe baby. This instruction is present in\nthe thread-like structures, called\nchromosomes  in the fertilised egg.\nChromosomes are present inside the\nnucleus of every cell. All human beings\nhave 23 pairs of chromosomes in the\nnuclei of their cells. Two chromosomes\nout of these are the sex chromosomes,\nnamed X and Y . A female has two X\nchromosomes, while a male has one X\nand one Y chromosome. The gametes\n(egg and sperm) have only one set of\nchromosomes. The unfertilised egg\nalways has one X chromosome. But\n2024-25\n\nREACHING  THE AGE OF ADOLESCENCE 85sperms are of two kinds. One kind has\nan X chromosome, and the other kind\nhas a Y chromosome.\nSee Fig. 7.4. When a sperm\ncontaining X chromosome fertilises the\negg, the zygote would have two X\nchromosomes and develop into a female\nchild. If the sperm contributes a Y\nchromosome to the egg (ovum) at\nfertilisation, the zygote would develop\ninto a male child.and ovaries to produce their hormones.\nYou have alr eady lear nt that the\npituitary gland is an endocrine gland.\nIt is attached to the brain.\nApart from the pituitary, the testes\nand the ovaries, there are other\nendocrine glands in the body such as\nthyroid, pancreas and adrenals\n(Fig. 7.5).\nFig. 7.4 : Sex determination in humansboy girlsperms\neggs\nNow you know that the sex\nchromosomes of the father determine the\nsex of an unborn baby. The belief that\nthe mother is responsible for the sex of\nher baby is completely wrong and to\nblame her for this is totally unjustified.\n7.7 Hormones other than\nSex Hormones\nLook at Fig. 7.3 again. The hormones\nsecreted by the pituitary stimulate testesFig. 7.5 :Position of endocrine glands in the\nhuman body\npituitary\ngland\nthyroid gland\nadrenal\ngland\npancreas\ntestisposition of\nthe ovary in\nthe female\nBoojho and Paheli had once visited\ntheir aunt who was a doctor and\nremembered that a boy named Kaka had\na very big and bulging throat. Their aunt\nhad told them that Kaka was suffering\nfrom ‘goitre’, a disease of the thyroid\ngland . Kaka’s thyroid gland was not\nproducing the hormone thyroxine .\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 86Their aunt also told them that their\nuncle was suffering from ‘diabetes’\nbecause his pancreas was not producing\nthe hormone insulin  in sufficient\nquantities. Boojho and Paheli then\nasked their aunt about the adrenal\nglands, which are also shown in the\nchart hung on the wall of her clinic. The\naunt told them that adrenal glands\nsecrete hormones which maintain the\ncorrect salt balance in the blood.\nAdrenals also produce the hormone\nadrenalin. It helps the body to adjust\nto stress when one is very angry,\nembarrassed or worried.\nThyroid and adrenals secrete their\nhormones when they receive orders from\nthe pituitary through its hormones.\nPituitary also secretes growth hormone\nwhich is necessary for the normal\ngrowth of a person.controlled by insect hormones.  In a\nfrog, it is controlled by thyroxine, the\nhormone produced by thyroid.\nThyroxine production requires the\npresence of iodine in water . If the water\nin which the tadpoles are growing does\nnot contain sufficient iodine, the\ntadpoles cannot become adults.\n7.8 Role of Hormones in\nCompleting the Life\nHistory of Insects and\nFrogs\nYou have alr eady lear nt about the life\ncycle of the frog. The tadpole passes\nthrough certain stages to become a frog\n(Chapter 6). This change from larva to\nadult is called metamorphosis\n(Fig. 6.10). Metamorphosis in insects isCollect information from magazines\nor from doctors and prepare a note\non the importance of consuming\niodised salt. Y ou can also look for\nthis information on the internet.\n7.9 Reproductive Health\nThe physical and mental well being of\nan individual is regarded as an\nindividual’s health. To keep the body\nhealthy, every human being, at any age,\nneeds to have a balanced diet. The\nperson must also observe personal\nhygiene and undertake adequate\nphysical exercise.\nDuring adolescence, however , these\nbecome even more essential as the body\nis growing.\nNutritional Needs of the Adolescents\nAdolescence is a stage of rapid growth\nand development. Hence the diet for an\nAre there hormones in\nother animals also? Have\nthey any role to play in\nreproduction?\nIf people do not have\nenough iodine in their diet,\nwill they get goitre caused\nby lack of thyroxine?\nActivity 7.3\n2024-25\n\nREACHING  THE AGE OF ADOLESCENCE 87adolescent has to be carefully planned.\nYou have alr eady lear nt what a balanced\ndiet is. Recall that a balanced diet means\nthat the meals include proteins,\ncarbohydrates, fats and vitamins in\nrequisite proportions. Our Indian meal\nof roti/rice,  dal (pulses) and vegetables\nis a balanced meal. Milk is a balanced\nfood in itself. Fruits also provide\nnourishment. For infants, mother’s milk\nprovides all the nourishment that\nthey need.\nIron builds blood and iron-rich food\nsuch as leafy vegetables, jaggery, meat,\ncitrus, Indian gooseberry (amla)  are good\nfor adolescents.\nCheck items for lunch and dinner in\nyour meal. Is the meal balanced and\nnutritious? Does it include cereals\nwhich give energy and milk, meat, nuts\nand pulses which provide proteins for\ngrowth? Also, does it include fats and\nsugar that give energy? What about\nfruits and vegetables which are\nprotective foods? Chips and packed or\ntinned snacks, though very tasty\nshould never replace regular meals as\nthey do not have adequate nutritional\nvalue.\nActivity 7.4\nMake a group with your friends.\nWrite down the items of food in your\nbreakfast, lunch and dinner you\nhad on the previous day. Identify\nthe items responsible for proper\ngrowth. Also identified the  junk\nfood that you consumed the\nprevious day.Personal Hygiene\nEveryone should have a bath at least\nonce everyday. It is more necessary for\nteenagers because the increased activity\nof sweat glands sometimes makes the\nbody smelly. All parts of the body should\nbe washed and cleaned everyday. If\nmeat\nvegetables\nfruitsmilk and\neggs\ngrains\nFig. 7.6 : Nutritious items of foodActivity 7.5\nGet ideas from the pictures given in\nFig.7.6. Prepare charts or posters\nand paste them in the class so that\nyou are aware of the diet for\nadolescents. Y ou may use your\ncreative ideas and present it like an\nadvertisement. Y ou may even\norganise a competition on this topic.\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 88cleanliness is not maintained there are\nchances of catching bacterial  infection.\nGirls  should take special care of\ncleanliness during the time of menstrual\nflow. They should keep track of their\nmenstrual cycle and be prepared for the\nonset of menstruation. Use sanitary\nnapkin or clean homemade pads.\nChange pads after every 4–5 hours as\nper the requirement.\nPhysical exercise\nWalking and playing in fresh air keeps\nthe body fit and healthy. All young boys\nand girls should take walks, exercise\nand play outdoor games.Activity 7.6\nCollect data on the number of\nchildren in your class who exercise\nregularly and who do not exercise\nregularly. Did you notice any\ndifference in their fitness and\nhealth? Prepare a report on the\nbenefits of regular exercise.\nSay “NO” to Drugs\nAdolescence is a period of much\nactivity in the body and mind which\nis a normal part of growing up. So do\nnot feel confused or insecure. If\nanybody suggests that you will get\nrelief if you take some drugs, just say\n‘No’ unless pr escribed by the doctor .\nDrugs are addictive. If you take them\nonce, you feel like taking them again\nand again. They harm the body in the\nlong run. They ruin health and\nhappiness.\nYou must have hear d about AIDS\nwhich is caused by a dangerous virus,\nHIV. This virus can pass on to a\nnormal person from an infected\nperson by sharing the syringes used\nfor injecting drugs. It can also be\ntransmitted to an infant from the\ninfected  mother through her milk. The\nvirus  can also be transmitted through\nsexual contact with a person infected\nwith HIV .\nAdolescent Pregnancy\nYou might be knowing that in our country, the legal age for marriage is 18 years\nfor girls and 21 years for boys. This is because teenage mothers are not prepared\nmentally or physically for motherhood. Early marriage and motherhood cause health\nproblems in the mother and the child. It also curtails employment opportunities for\nthe young woman and may cause mental agony as she is not ready for\nresponsibilities of motherhood.Myths, Taboos, Do’s and Don’ts\nYou have lear nt her e and fr om Chapter\n6 the scientific facts related to human\nreproduction. There are many wrong\nnotions which you should now be able\nto discard as informed adolescents. For\nexample, there are myths and taboos\nregarding bodily changes that\nadolescents experience. Some of these\nare given below and you can now argue\nwhy these are myths and not facts.\n1.A girl becomes pregnant if\nshe looks at boys during\nmenstruation.\n2.The mother is responsible for the\nsex of her child.\n3.A girl should not be allowed to\nwork in the kitchen during\nmenstruation.\nYou may come acr oss many other myths\nand taboos.
