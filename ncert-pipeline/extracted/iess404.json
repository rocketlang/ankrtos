It\nlooked like any ordinary circular or\nnotice that you may have seen in\nschool. The government issues hun-\ndreds of orders every day on differ-\nent matters.

Let us\nsee how the decision was taken and\nwhat happened later.A Government OrderA Government OrderA Government OrderA Government OrderA Government Order\nOn August 13, 1990, the Government\nof India issued an Order. It was\ncalled an Office Memorandum. Like\nall government orders, it had a num-\nber and is known by that: O. M. No.\n36012/31/90-Est (SCT), dated\n13.8.1990.

It said that 27 per\ncent of the vacancies in civil posts\nand services under the Government\nof India are reserved for the Socially\nand Educationally Backward Classes\n(SEBC). SEBC is another name for all\nthose people who belong to castes\nthat are considered backward by the\ngovernment. The benefit of job res-\nervation was till then available only\nto Scheduled Castes and Scheduled\nTribes. Now a new third category\ncalled SEBC was introduced. Only\npersons who belong to backward\nclasses were eligible for this quota\nof 27 per cent jobs. Others could not\ncompete for these jobs.\nT TT TThe D he Dhe D he Dhe D e ee eecision M cision Mcision M cision Mcision M ak akak akakers ersers ersers\nWho decided to issue this\nMemorandum? Clearly, such a big\ndecision could not have been taken\nby the person who signed that\ndocument. The officer was merely\nimplementing the instructions given\nby the Minister of Personnel, Public\nGrievances and Pensions, of which\nthe Department was a part. We can\nguess that such a major decision\nwould have involved other major\nfunctionaries in our country. You\nhave already read in the previous\nclass about some of them. Let us go\nover some of the main points that\nyou covered then:\n/UIstopPresident is the head of the state\nand is the highest formal authority\nin the country.\n/UIstopPrime Minister is the head of the\ngovernment  and actually exercises\nall governmental powers. He takes\nmost of the decisions in the\nCabinet meetings.\n/UIstopParliament consists of the\nPresident and two Houses, Lok\nSabha and Rajya Sabha. The Prime\nMinister must have the support of\na majority of Lok Sabha members.So, were all these people involved\nin this decision regarding the Office\nMemorandum? Let us find out.\nACTIVITY\n/UIstopWhich points, other than the ones mentioned\nabove, do you recall about these institutions\nfrom the previous class? Discuss in class.\n/UIstopCan you think of a major decision made by\nyour state gover nment? How were the Gover -\nnor, the Council of Ministers, the state assem-\nbly and the cour ts involved in that decision?\nThis Office Memorandum was the\nculmination of a long chain of\nevents. The Government of India had\nappointed the Second Backward\nClasses Commission in 1979. It was\nheaded by B.P. Mandal. Hence it was\npopularly called the Mandal\nCommission. It was asked to\ndetermine the criteria to identify the\nsocially and educationally backward\nclasses in India and recommend\nsteps to be taken for their\nadvancement. The Commission gave\nits Report in 1980 and made many\nrecommendations. One of these  was\nthat 27 per cent of government jobs\nbe reserved for the socially and\neducationally backward classes.\nThe Report and recommendations\nwere discussed in the Parliament.\nFor several years, many\nparliamentarians and parties kept\ndemanding the implementation of\nthe Commission’s recommendations.\nThen came the  Lok Sabha election\nof 1989. In its election manifesto,\nthe Janata Dal promised that if voted\nto power, it would implement the\nMandal Commission report. The\nJanata Dal did form the government\nafter this election. Its leader V. P.\nSingh became the Prime Minister .\nSeveral developments took place\nafter that:Now I can see\nclearly! That is why\nthey talk of\nMandalisation of\npolitics. Don’t they?Is every Office\nMemorandum a\nmajor political\ndecision? If not,\nwhat made this\none different?\nReprint 2025-26\n\n59were full of different views and\nopinions on this issue. It led to\nwidespread protests and counter-\nprotests, some of which were violent.\nPeople reacted strongly because this\ndecision affected thousands of job\nopportunities. Some felt that\nexistence of inequalities among\npeople of different castes in India\nnecessitated job reservations. They\nfelt, this would give a fair\nopportunity to those communities\nwho so far had not adequately been\nrepresented in government\nemployment.\nOthers felt that this was unfair as\nit would deny equality of opportunity\nto those who did not belong to\nbackward communities. They would\nbe denied jobs even though they\ncould be more qualified. Some felt\nthat this would perpetuate caste\nfeelings among people and hamper\nnational unity. In this chapter we\nwon’t discuss whether the decision\nwas good or not. We only take this\nexample to understand how major\ndecisions are taken and\nimplemented in the country.\nWho resolve d this dispute? You\nknow that the Supreme Court and the\nHigh Courts in India settle disputes\narising out of governmental decisions.\nSome persons and associations\nopposed to this order filed a number\nof cases in the courts. They appealed\nto the courts to declare the order\ninvalid and stop its implementation.\nThe Supreme Court of India bunched\nall these cases together. This case was\nknown as the ‘Indira Sawhney and\nothers Vs Union of India case’. Eleven\njudges of the Supreme Court heard\narguments of both sides. By a\nmajority , the Supreme Court judges\nin 1992 declared  that this order of the\nGovernment of India was valid.

The senior officers of\nthe Department drafted an order in\nline with the Cabinet decision and\ntook the minister’s approval. An\nofficer signed the order on behalf of\nthe Union Government. This was\nhow O.M. No. 36012/ 31/90 was\nborn on 13 August 1990.\nFor the next few months, this was\nthe most hotly debated issue in the\ncountry.

The dispute\nthus came to an end and this policy\nhas been followed since then.\nN NN NNee eeee eeeed f d fd f d fd for P or Por P or Por P olitical Institutionsolitical Institutionsolitical Institutionsolitical Institutionsolitical Institutions\nWe have seen one example of how\nthe government works. Governing a\ncountry involves various such\nactivities. For example, the\ngovernment is responsible for\nensuring security to the citizens and\nproviding facilities for educ ation\nand health to all. It collects taxes\nand spends the money thus raised\non admi nistration, defence and\ndevelopm ent programmes. It\nformulates and implements several\nwelfare sche mes. Some persons have\nto take decisions on how to go about\nthese activities. Others have to\nimplement these decisions. If\ndisputes arise on these decisions or\nin their implementati on, there should\nbe someone to determine what is\nright and what is wrong. It is\nimportant that everyone should\nknow who is responsible for doing\nwhat. It is also important that these\nactivities keep taking place even if\nthe persons in key positions change.\nSo, to attend to all these tasks,\nseveral arrangements are made in\nall modern democracies. Such\narrangements are called institutions.\nA democracy works well wh en these\ninstitutions perform  functions\nassigned to them. The Constitution\nof any country lays down basic\nrules on the powers and functionsof each institution. In the example\nabove, we saw several such\ninstitutions at work.\n/UIstopThe Prime Minister and the\nCabinet are institutions that take\nall important policy decisions.\n/UIstopThe Civil Servants, working\ntogether, are responsible for\ntaking steps to implement the\nministers’ decisions.\n/UIstopSupreme Court is an institution\nwhere disputes between citizens\nand the government are finally\nsettled.\nCan you think of some other insti-\ntutions in this example? What is\ntheir role?\nWorking with institutions is not\neasy. Institutions involve rules and\nregulations. This can bind the hands\nof leaders. Institutions involve\nmeetings, committees and routines.\nThis often leads to delays and\ncomplications. Therefore dealing\nwith institutions can be frustrating.\nOne might feel that it is much better\nto have one person take all decisions\nwithout any rules, procedures and\nmeetings. But that is not the spirit\nof democracy. Some of the delays\nand complications introduced by\ninstitutions are very useful. They\nprovide an opportunity for a wider\nset of people to be consulted in any\ndecision. Institutions make it\nSupreme Cour t\nCabinet\nPresident\nGovernment Officials\nReprint 2025-26\n\n61\ndifficult to have a good decision\ntaken very quickly. But they also\nmake it equally difficult to rush\nclass and try to imagine what\nParliament could have done if it did\nnot approve of the Cabinet’s\ndecision.\nW WW WWh hh hhy do w y do wy do w y do wy do w e nee e neee nee e neee nee d a d ad a d ad a\nP PP PPar arar ararliamen liamenliamen liamenliamen t? t?t? t?t?\nIn all democracies, an assembly of\nelected representatives exercises\nsupreme political authority on\nbehalf of the people. In India such a\nnational assembly of elected\nrepresentatives is called Parliament.\nAt the state level this is called\nLegislature  or Legislative Assembly.\nThe name may vary in different\ncountries, but such an assembly\nexists in every democracy. It\nexercises political authority on\nbehalf of the people in many ways:\n1Parliament is the final authority for\nmaking laws in any country. This\ntask of law making or legislation\nis so crucial that these assemblies\nare called legislatures. Parliaments\nall over the world can make new\nlaws, change existing laws, or\nabolish existing laws and make\nnew ones in their place.\n2Parliaments all over the world\nexercise some control over those\nwho run the government. In some\ncountries like India this control is\ndirect and full. Those who run the\ngovernment can take decisions\nonly so long as they enjoy support\nof Parliament.\n3Parliaments control all the money\nthat governments have. In most\ncountries the public money can\nbe spent only when Parliament\nsanctions it.through a bad decision. That is why\ndemocratic governments insist on\ninstitutions.\n4.2 P ARLIAMENT\nIn the example of the Office\nMemorandum, do you remember\nthe role of Parliament? Perhaps not.\nSince this decision was not taken\nby Parliament, you might think that\nParliament had no role in it. But let\nus go back to the story and see\nwhether Parliament figures in it. Let\nus recall the points made earlier by\ncompleting the following sentences:\n/UIstopThe Report of the Mandal\nCommission was discussed …\n/UIstopThe President of India mentioned\nthis in his …\n/UIstopThe Prime Minister made a …\nThe decision was not directly taken\nin Parliament. But Parliamentary\ndiscussions on the Report influenced\nand shaped the decision of the\ngovernment. They brought pressure\non the government to act on the\nMandal recommendation. If\nParliament  was not in favour of this\ndecision, the Government could not\nhave gone ahead with it. Can you\nguess why? Recall what you read\nabout Parliament in the earlier\nWORKIN G OF INSTITUTI ONSIrfan Khan\nReprint 2025-26\n\n62 DEMOCRA TIC POLITICS\n4Parliament is the highest forum of\ndiscussion and debate on public\nissues and national policy in any\ncountry.

One House is usually\ndirectly elected by the people and\nexercises the real power on behalf\nof the people. The second House is\nusually elected indirectly and\nperforms some special functions.\nThe most common work for the\nsecond House is to look after the\ninterests of various states, regions\nor federal units.\nIn our country, Parliament\nconsists of two Houses. The two\nHouses are known as the Council of\nStates (Rajya Sabha) and the House\nof the People (Lok Sabha). The\nPresident of India is a part of\nParliament, although she is not a\nmember of either House. That is why\nall laws made in the Houses come\ninto force only after they receive the\nassent of the President.\nYou have read about the Indian\nParliament in earlier classes. From\nthe Chapter 3 you know how Lok\nSabha elections take place. Let us\nrecall some key differences between\nthe composition of these two Houses\nof Parliament. Answer the following\nfor the Lok Sabha and the Rajya\nSabha:\n/UIstopWhat is the total number of\nmembers? …\n/UIstopWho elects the members? …\n/UIstopWhat is the length of the term (in\nyears)? …\n/UIstopCan the House be dissolved or is\nit permanent? …What is the point in\nhaving so much\ndebate and\ndiscussion in the\nParliament when\nwe know that the\nview of the ruling\nparty is going to\nprevail?Which of the two Houses is more\npowerful? It might appear that the\nRajya Sabha is more powerful, for\nsometimes it is called the ‘Upper\nChamber’ and the Lok Sabha the\n‘Lower Chamber’. But this does not\nmean that Rajya Sabha is more\npowerful than Lok Sabha. This is\njust an old style of speaking and not\nthe language used in our\nConstitution.\nOur Constitution does give the\nRajya Sabha some special powers\nover the states. But on most matters,\nthe Lok Sabha exercises supreme\npower. Let us see how:\n1Any ordinary law needs to be\npassed by both the Houses. But if\nthere is a difference between the\ntwo Houses, the final decision is\ntaken in a joint session in which\nmembers of both the Houses sit\ntogether. Because of the larger\nnumber of members, the view of\nthe Lok Sabha is likely to prevail\nin such a meeting.\n2Lok Sabha exercises more powers\nin money matters. Once the Lok\nSabha passes the budget of the\ngovernment or any other money\nrelated law, the Rajya Sabha\ncannot reject it. The Rajya Sabha\ncan only delay it by 14 days or\nsuggest changes in it. The Lok\nSabha may or may not accept\nthese changes.\nACTIVITY\nWhen Parliament is in session, there is a special\nprogramme everyday on Doordarshan about the\nproceedings in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha.

We found out\nthat the person who signed the\ndocument did not take this\ndecision. He was only executing the\npolicy decision taken by someone\nelse. We noted the role of the Prime\nMinister in taking that decision. But\nwe also know that he could not\nhave taken that decision if he did\nnot have support from the Lok Sabha.\nIn that sense he was only executing\nthe wishes of the Parliament.\nThus, at different levels of any\ngovernment we find functionaries\nwho take day-to-day decisions but\ndo not exercise supreme power on\nbehalf of the people. All those\nfunctionaries are collectively known\nas the executive . They are called\nexecutive because they are in charge\nof the ‘execution’ of the policies of\nthe government. Thus, when we talk\nabout ‘the government’ we usually\nmean the executive.\nP PP PPolitical and P olitical and Political and P olitical and Political and P er erer erermanen manenmanen manenmanen t tt ttE EE EEx xx xxe ee eec cc ccutiv utivutiv utivutiv e ee ee\nIn a democratic country, two\ncategories make up the executive.\nOne that is elected by the people for\na specific period, is called the\npolitical executive. Political leaders\nwho take the big decisions fall in this\ncategory. In the second category,\npeople are  appointed on a long-term\nbasis. This is called the permanent\nexecutive or civil services. Persons\nworking in civil services are called\ncivil servants. They remain in office\neven when the ruling party changes.\nThese officers work under political\nexecutive and assist them in\ncarrying out the day-to-day\nadministration. Can you recall the\nrole of political and non-politicalexecutive in the case of the Office\nMemorandum?\nYou might ask: Why does the\npolitical executive have more power\nthan the non-political executive?\nWhy is the minister more powerful\nthan the civil servant? The civil\nservant is usually more educated\nand has more expert knowledge of\nthe subject. The advisors working in\nthe Finance Ministry know more\nabout economics than the Finance\nMinister. Sometimes the ministers\nmay know very little about the\ntechnical matters that come under\ntheir ministry. This could easily\nhappen in ministries like Defence,\nIndustry, Health, Science and\nTechnology, Mines, etc. Why should\nthe minister have the final say on\nthese matters?\nThe reason is very simple. In a\ndemocracy the will of the people is\nsupreme. The minister is an elected\nrepresentative of the people and\nthus empowered to exercise the will\nof the people on their behalf. She is\nfinally answerable to the people for\nall the consequences of her\ndecision. That is why the minister\ntakes all the final decisions. The\nminister decides the overall\nframework and objectives in which\ndecisions on policy should be\nmade. The minister is not, and is not\nexpected to be, an expert in the\nmatters of her ministry. The\nminister takes the advice of experts\non all technical matters. But very\noften experts hold different opinions\nor place before her more than one\noption. Depending on what the\noverall objective is, the minister\ndecides.\nActually this happens in any large\norganisation. Those who understand\nthe overall picture take the most\nReprint 2025-26\n\n65\nimportant decisions, not the\nexperts. The experts can tell the\nroute, but someone with a larger\nview decides the destination. In a\ndemocracy elected ministers\nperform this role.\nP PP PPr rr rrime M ime Mime M ime Mime M inist inistinist inistinist er and C er and Cer and C er and Cer and C ouncil ouncilouncil ouncilouncilof M of Mof M of Mof M inist inistinist inistinist ers ersers ersers\nPrime Minister is the most\nimportant political institution  in the\ncountry. Yet there is no direct\nelection to the post of the Prime\nMinister. The President appoints the\nPrime Minister. But the President\ncannot appoint anyone she likes.\nThe President appoints the leader\nof the majority party or the coalition\nof parties that commands a majority\nin the Lok Sabha, as Prime Minister.\nIn case no single party or alliance\ngets a majority, the President\nappoints the person most likely to\nsecure a majority support. The\nPrime Minister does not have a fixed\ntenure. He continues in power so\nlong as he remains the leader of the\nmajority party or coalition.After the appointment of the Prime\nMinister, the President appoints\nother ministers on the advice of the\nPrime Minister. The Ministers are\nusually from the party or the\ncoalition that has the majority in the\nLok Sabha. The Prime Minister is\nfree to choose ministers, as long as\nthey are members of Parliament.\nSometimes, a person who is not a\nmember of Parliament can also\nbecome a minister. But such a\nperson has to get elected to one of\nthe Houses of Parliament within six\nmonths of appointment as minister.\nCouncil of Ministers is the official\nname for the body that includes all\nthe Ministers. It usually has 60 to\n80 Ministers of different ranks.\n/UIstopCabinet Ministers  are usually top-\nlevel leaders of the ruling party or\nparties who are in charge of the\nmajor ministries. Usually the\nCabinet Ministers meet to take\ndecisions in the name of the\nCouncil of Ministers. Cabinet is\nthus the inner ring of the Council\nof Ministers. It comprises about 25\nministers.\n/UIstopMinisters of State with indepen-\ndent charge  are usually in-charge\nof smaller Ministries. They\nparticipate in the Cabinet meet-\nings only when specially invited.\n/UIstopMinisters of State  are attached to\nand required to assist Cabinet\nMinisters.\nSince it is not practical for all\nministers to meet regularly and\ndiscuss everything, the decisions are\ntaken in Cabinet meetings. That is\nwhy parliamentary democracy in\nmost countries is often known as the\nCabinet form of government. The\nCabinet works as a team. The\nministers may have different views\nand opinions, but everyone has to own\nup to every decision of the Cabinet.\nWORKIN G OF INSTITUTI ONSThe race to become\nminister is not new .\nHere is a car toon\ndepicting ministerial\naspirants waiting to\nget a ber th in Nehr u’s\nCabinet af ter the\n1962 elections.

But as\nhead of the government, the Prime\nMinister has wide ranging powers.\nHe chairs Cabinet meetings. He\ncoordinates the work of different\nDepartments. His decisions are final\nin case disagreements arise between\nDepartments. He exercises general\nsupervision of different ministries.\nAll ministers work under his\nleadership. The Prime Minister\ndistributes and redistributes work\nto the ministers. He also has the\npower to dismiss ministers. When\nthe Prime Minister quits, the entire\nministry quits.\nThus, if the Cabinet is the most\npowerful institution in India, within\nthe Cabinet it is the Prime Ministerwho is the most powerful. The\npowers of the Prime Minister in all\nparliamentary democracies of the\nworld have increased so much in\nrecent decades that parliamentary\ndemocracies are some times seen as\nPrime Ministerial form of\ngovernment. As political parties have\ncome to play a major role in politics,\nthe Prime Minister controls the\nCabinet and Parliament through the\nparty.

The President supervises\nthe overall functioning of all the political\ninstitutions in the country so that they\noperate in harmony to achieve the\nobjectives of the State.The President is not elected directly\nby the people. The elected Members\nof Parliament (MPs) and the elected\nMembers of the Legislative\nAssemblies (MLAs) elect her. A\ncandidate standing for President’s\npost has to get a majority of votes to\nwin the election. This ensures that\nthe President can be seen to represent\nthe entire nation. At the same time\nthe President can never claim the kind\nof direct popular mandate that the\nPrime Minister can. This ensures that\nshe remains only a nominal executive.\nThe same is true of the powers of\nthe President. If you casually read\nthe Constitution you would think\nthat there is nothing that she cannot\ndo. All governmental activities take\nplace in the name of the President.\nAll laws and major policy decisions\nof the government are issued in her\nname. All major appointments are\nmade in the name of the President.\nThese include the appointment ofWhy does this\nbook refer to the\nPresident as ‘she’?\nHave we ever had\na woman President\nin our country?\nDid you protest\nwhen the book\nreferred to the\nPrime Minister as\n‘he’?

The\nPresident is the supreme\ncommander of the defence forces of\nIndia.\nBut we should remember that the\nPresident exercises all these powers\nonly on the advice of the Council of\nMinisters. The President can ask the\nCouncil of Ministers to reconsider its\nadvice. But if the same advice is\ngiven again, she is bound to act\naccording to it. Similarly, a bill\npassed by the Parliament becomes\na law only after the President gives\nassent to it. If the President wants,\nshe can delay this for some time and\nsend the bill back to Parliament for\nreconsideration. But if Parliament\npasses the bill again, she has to\nsign it.\nSo you may wonder what does the\nPresident really do? Can she do\nanything on her own at all? There is\none very important thing she should\ndo on her own: appoint the Prime\nMinister. When a party or coalition\nof parties secures a clear majority\nin the elections, the President, has\nto appoint the leader of the majority\nparty or the coalition that enjoys\nmajority support in the Lok Sabha.When no party or coalition gets a\nmajority in the Lok Sabha, the\nPresident exercises her discretion.\nThe President appoints a leader who\nin her opinion can muster majority\nsupport in the Lok Sabha. In such a\ncase, the President can ask the\nnewly appointed Prime Minister to\nprove majority support in the Lok\nSabha within a specified time.\nThe P residen tial S ystem\nPresidents all over the world are not always nomi-\nnal executives like the President of India. In many\ncountries of the world, the President is both the\nhead of the state and the head of the government.\nThe President of the United States of America is\nthe most well known example of this kind of Presi-\ndent. The US President is directly elected by the\npeople. He personally chooses and appoints all\nMinisters. The law making is still done by the leg-\nislature (called the Congress in the US), but the\npresident can veto any law . Most impor tantly , the\npresident does not need the suppor t of the major -\nity of members in the Congress and neither is he\nanswerable to them. He has a fixed tenure of four\nyears and completes it even if his par ty does not\nhave a majority in the Congress.\nThis model is followed in most of the countries\nof Latin America and many of the ex-Soviet Union\ncountries. Given the centrality of the President,\nthis system of government is called the Presiden-\ntial form of government. In countries like ours that\nfollow the British model, the parliament is su-\npreme. Therefore our system is called the parlia-\nmentary system of government.\nEliamma, Annakutti and Marymol read the section on the President. Each of them had a question. Can\nyou help them in answering these questions?\nEliamma :What happens if the President and the Prime Minister disagree about some policy?

What was the\noriginal verdict? Did the High Cour t or the\nSupreme Cour t change it? What was the reason?\nThis is why an independent and\npowerful judiciary  is considered\nessential for democracies. All the\ncourts at different levels in a country\nput together are called the judiciary.\nThe Indian judiciary consists of a\nSupreme Court for the entire nation,\nHigh Courts in the states, District\nCourts and the courts at local level.\nIndia has an integrated judiciary. It\nmeans the Supreme Court controls\nthe judicial administration in the\ncountry. Its decisions are binding on\nall other courts of the country. It can\ntake up any dispute\n/UIstopBetween citizens of the country;\n/UIstopBetween citizens and government;\n/UIstopBetween two or more state\ngovernments; and\n/UIstopBetween governments at the union\nand state level.\nIt is the highest court of appeal in\ncivil and criminal cases. It can hear\nappeals against the decisions of the\nHigh Courts.\nIndependence of the judiciary\nmeans that it is not under the\ncontrol of the legislature or the\nexecutive. The judges do not act on\nthe direction of the government or\naccording to the wishes of the party\nin power. That is why all modern\ndemocracies have courts that are\nindependent of the legislature and\nthe executive. India has achieved\nthis. The judges of the Supreme\nCourt and the High Courts are\nappointed by the President on the\nadvice of the Prime Minister and in\nWORKIN G OF INSTITUTI ONSLet us return, one final time, to the\nstory of Office Memorandum that we\nstarted with. This time let us not\nrecall the story, but imagine how\ndifferent the story could have been.\nRemember, the story came to a\nsatisfactory end because the\nSupreme Court gave a verdict that\nwas accepted by everyone. Imagine\nwhat would have happened in the\nfollowing situations:\n/UIstopIf there was nothing like a\nSupreme Court in the country.\n/UIstopEven if there was a Supreme\nCourt, if it had no power to judge\nactions of the government.\n/UIstopEven if it had the power, if no one\ntrusted the Supreme Court to give\na fair verdict.\n/UIstopEven if it gave a fair judgement, if\nthose who appealed against the\nGovernment Order did not accept\nthe judgement.It is quite common in\nthe US for judges to\nbe nominated on the\nbasis of well-known\npolitical opinions and\naffiliations.

In practice it\nnow means that the senior judges\nof the Supreme Court select the new\njudges of the Supreme Court and the\nHigh Courts.  There  is very little scope\nfor interference by the political\nexecutive. The senior most judge of\nthe Supreme Court is usually\nappointed the Chief Justice. Once\na person is appointed as judge of the\nSupreme Court or the High Court it\nis nearly impossible to remove him\nor her from that position. It is as\ndifficult as removing the President\nof India. A judge can be removed\nonly by an impeachment motion\npassed separately by two-thirds\nmembers of the two Houses of the\nParliament. It has never happened\nin the history of Indian democracy.\nThe judiciary in India is also one\nof the most powerful in the world.\nThe Supreme Court and the High\nCourts have the power to interpret\nthe Constitution of the country. They\ncan declare invalid any law of the\nlegislature or the actions of the\nexecutive, whether at the Union\nlevel or at the state level, if they find\nsuch a law or action is against theConstitution. Thus they can\ndetermine the Constitutional\nvalidity of any legislation or action\nof the executive in the country,\nwhen it is challenged before them.\nThis is known as the judicial review.\nThe Supreme Court of India has also\nruled that the core or basic\nprinciples of the Constitution cannot\nbe changed by the Parliament.\nThe powers and the independence\nof the Indian judiciary allow it to act\nas the guardian of the Fundamental\nRights. We shall see in the next\nchapter that the citizens have a\nright to approach the courts to seek\nremedy in case of any violation of\ntheir rights. In recent years the\nCourts have given several\njudgments and directives to protect\npublic interest and human rights.\nAny one can approach the courts if\npublic interest is hurt by the actions\nof government. This is called public\ninterest litigation. The courts\nintervene to prevent the misuse of\nthe government ’s power to mak e\ndecisions. They check malpractices\non the part of pub lic officials.
