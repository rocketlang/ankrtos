Leibnitz\n(1646–1716)\nReprint 2025-26\n\nRELATIONS AND FUNCTIONS          25\nbrackets and grouped together in a particular order , i.e., ( p,q), p ∈ P and  q ∈ Q . This\nleads to the following definition:\nDefinition 1\n Given two non-empty sets P and Q. The cartesian product P × Q is the\nset of all ordered pairs of elements from P and Q, i.e.,\nP × Q = { ( p,q) : p  ∈ P, q  ∈ Q }\nIf either P or Q is the null set, then P × Q will also be empty set, i.e., P × Q = φ\nFrom the illustration given above we note that\nA × B = {(red, b), (red, c), (red, s), (blue, b), (blue, c), (blue, s)}.\nAgain, consider the two sets:\nA = {DL, MP , KA}, where DL, MP , KA  represent Delhi,\nMadhya Pradesh and Karnataka, respectively and B = {01,02,\n03}representing codes for the licence plates of vehicles issued\nby DL, MP and KA .\nIf the three states, Delhi, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka\nwere making codes for the licence plates of vehicles, with the\nrestriction that the code begins with an element from set A,\nwhich are the pairs available from these sets and how many such\npairs will there be ( Fig 2.2)?\nThe available pairs are:(DL,01), (DL,02), (DL,03), (MP ,01), (MP,02), (MP ,03),\n(KA,01), (KA,02), (KA,03) and the product of set A and set B is given by\nA × B = {(DL,01), (DL,02), (DL,03), (MP ,01), (MP ,02), (MP ,03), (KA,01), (KA,02),\n     (KA,03)}.\nIt can easily be seen that there will be 9 such pairs in the Cartesian product, since\nthere are 3 elements in each of the sets A and B. This gives us 9 possible codes. Also\nnote that the order in which these elements are paired is crucial. For example, the code\n(DL, 01) will not be the same as the code (01, DL).\nAs a final illustration, consider the two sets A= { a1, a2} and\nB = {b1, b2, b3, b4} (Fig 2.3) .\nA × B= {( a1, b1), (a1, b2), (a1, b3), (a1, b4), (a2, b1), (a2, b2),\n                   ( a2, b3), (a2, b4)}.\nThe 8 ordered pairs thus formed can represent the position of points in\nthe plane if A and B are subsets of the set of real numbers and it is\nobvious that the point in the position ( a1, b2) will be distinct from the point\nin the position ( b2, a1).\nRemarks\n(i)Two ordered pairs are equal, if and only if  the corresponding first elements\nare equal and the second  elements are also equal.DL MP KA03\n02\n01\nFig 2.2\nFig 2.3\nReprint 2025-26\n\n26 MATHEMA TICS\n(ii) If there are p elements in A and q elements in B, then there will be pq\nelements in A × B, i.e.,  if n(A) = p and n(B) = q,  then n(A × B) = pq.\n(iii) If A and B are non-empty sets and either A or B is an infinite set, then so is\nA × B.\n(iv) A × A × A = {( a, b, c) : a, b, c ∈ A}. Here ( a, b, c) is called an ordered\ntriplet .\nExample\n 1 If  (x + 1, y – 2) = (3,1), find the values of x and y.\nSolution Since the ordered pairs are equal, the corresponding elements are equal.\nTherefore x + 1 = 3  and y – 2 = 1.\nSolving we get x = 2 and y = 3.\nExample 2 If P = {a, b, c} and Q = { r}, form the sets P  × Q and Q × P.\nAre these two products equal?\nSolution By the definition of the cartesian product,\nP × Q =  {( a, r), (b, r), (c, r)} and Q × P =  {( r, a), (\nr, b), (r, c)}\nSince, by the definition of equality of ordered pairs, the pair ( a, r) is not equal to the pair\n(r, a), we conclude that P  × Q ≠ Q × P .\nHowever , the number of elements in each set will be the same.\nExample 3 Let A = {1,2,3}, B = {3,4} and C = {4,5,6}. Find\n(i)A × (B ∩ C) (ii) (A × B) ∩ (A × C)\n(iii) A × (B ∪ C) (iv) (A × B) ∪ (A × C)\nSolution (i)By the definition of the intersection of two sets, (B ∩ C) = {4}.\nTherefore, A × (B ∩ C) = {(1,4), (2,4), (3,4)}.\n (ii) Now (A × B) = {(1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4), (3,3), (3,4)}\nand   (A × C) = {(1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6)}\nTherefore, (A × B) ∩ (A ×  C)  = {(1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4)}.\n(iii) Since, (B ∪ C) = {3, 4, 5, 6}, we have\nA × (B ∪ C) = {(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,3),\n(3,4), (3,5), (3,6)}.\n(iv) Using the sets A × B and A × C from part (ii) above, we obtain\n(A × B) ∪ (A \n× C) = {(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6),\n(3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6)}.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nRELATIONS AND FUNCTIONS          27\nExample 4 If P = {1, 2}, form the set P  × P × P.\nSolution  We have,  P  × P × P =  {(1,1,1), (1,1,2), (1,2,1), (1,2,2), (2,1,1), (2,1,2), (2,2,1),\n  (2,2,2)}.\nExample 5  If R is the set of all real numbers, what do the cartesian products R × \nR\nand R × R × R represent?\nSolution The Cartesian product R × R represents the set R × R={(x, y) : x, y ∈ R}\nwhich represents the coordinates of all the points in two dimensional space  and the\ncartesian product R × R × R represents the set R × R × R ={(x, y, z) : x, y, z ∈ R}\nwhich  represents the coordinates of all the points in thr ee-dimensional space .\nExample 6 If A × B ={( p, q),(p, r), (m, q), (m, r)}, find A and B.\nSolution A = set of first elements = { p, m}\nB = set of second elements = { q, r}.\nEXERCISE 2.1\n1.If  2 5 113 3 3 3x,y – ,   + =      , find the values of x and y.\n2.If the set A has 3 elements and the set B = {3, 4, 5}, then find the number of\nelements in (A ×B).\n3.If G = {7, 8} and H = {5, 4, 2}, find G × H and H × G.\n4.State whether each of the following statements are true or false.

The Cartesian product A × A has 9 elements among which are found (–1, 0) and\n(0,1).  Find the set A and the remaining elements of A\n × A.\n2.3  Relations\nConsider the two sets P  = {a, b, c} and Q = {Ali, Bhanu, Binoy , Chandra, Divya}.\nThe cartesian product of\nP and Q has 15 ordered pairs which\ncan be listed as P  × Q = {( a, Ali),\n(a,Bhanu), ( a, Binoy), ..., ( c, Divya)}.\nWe can now obtain a subset of\nP × Q by introducing a relation R\nbetween the first element x  and the\nsecond element y of each ordered pair\n(x, y) as\nR= { ( x,y): x is the first letter of the name y, x ∈ P, y ∈ Q}.\nThen R= {(a, Ali), ( b, Bhanu), ( b, Binoy), (c , Chandra)}\nA visual representation of this relation R (called an arrow diagram ) is shown\nin Fig 2.4.\nDefinition 2 A  relation R from a non-empty set A to a non-empty set B is a subset of\nthe cartesian product  A × B. The subset is derived by describing a relationship between\nthe first element and the second element of the ordered pairs in A × B. The second\nelement is called the image of  the first element.\nDefinition 3  The set of all first elements of the ordered pairs in a relation R  \nfrom a set\nA to a set B is called the domain  of the relation R.\nDefin ition 4  The set of all second elements in a relation R from a set A to a set B is\ncalled the range  of the relation R. The whole set B is called the codomain  of the\nrelation R. Note that range ⊂ codomain.\nRemarks (i)A relation  may be represented algebraically either by the Roster\nmethod  or by the Set-builder method .\n(ii)An arrow diagram is a visual representation of a relation.\nExample 7  Let A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. Define a relation R from A to A by\nR = {( x, y) : y =  x + 1 }\n(i)Depict this relation using an arrow diagram.\n(ii)Write down the domain, codomain and range of R.\nSolution (i)By the definition of the relation,\nR = {(1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,5), (5,6)} .Fig 2.4\nReprint 2025-26\n\nRELATIONS AND FUNCTIONS          29\nThe corresponding arrow diagram is\nshown in Fig 2.5.\n(ii) We can see that the\ndomain ={1, 2, 3, 4, 5,}\nSimilarly , the range = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\nand the codomain = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\nExample 8\n The Fig 2.6 shows a relation\nbetween the sets P  and Q. Write this relation (i) in set-builder form, (ii) in roster form.\nWhat is its domain and range?\nSolution It is obvious that the relation R is\n“x is the square of y”.\n(i) In set-builder form, R = {( x, y): x\n is the square of y, x ∈ P, y ∈ Q}\n(ii) In roster form, R = {(9, 3),\n(9, –3), (4, 2), (4, –2), (25, 5), (25, –5)}\nThe domain of this relation is {4, 9, 25}.\nThe range of this relation is {– 2, 2, –3, 3, –5, 5}.\nNote that the element 1 is not related to any element in set P .\nThe set Q is the codomain of this relation.\nANote  The total number of relations that can be defined from a set A to a set B\nis the number of  possible subsets of A × B. If n(A ) =  p and n\n(B) = q, then\nn (A × B) = pq and the total number of relations is 2pq.\nExample 9  Let A = {1, 2} and B = {3, 4}. Find the number of relations from A to B.\nSolution We have,\nA × B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}.\nSince n (A×B ) = 4, the number of subsets of A×B is 24. Therefore, the number of\nrelations from A into B will be 24.\nRemark   A relation R from A to A is also stated as a relation on A.\nEXERCISE 2.2\n1. Let A = {1, 2, 3,...,14}. Define a relation R from A to A by\nR = {( x, y) : 3\nx – y = 0, where x, y ∈ A}. Write down its domain, codomain and\nrange.Fig 2.5\nFig 2.6\nReprint 2025-26\n\n30 MATHEMA TICS\n2.

The subset is derived by describing a relationship between\nthe first element and the second element of the ordered pairs in A × B. The second\nelement is called the image of  the first element.\nDefinition 3  The set of all first elements of the ordered pairs in a relation R  \nfrom a set\nA to a set B is called the domain  of the relation R.\nDefin ition 4  The set of all second elements in a relation R from a set A to a set B is\ncalled the range  of the relation R. The whole set B is called the codomain  of the\nrelation R. Note that range ⊂ codomain.\nRemarks (i)A relation  may be represented algebraically either by the Roster\nmethod  or by the Set-builder method .\n(ii)An arrow diagram is a visual representation of a relation.\nExample 7  Let A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.

Let R be the relation on Z defined by R = {( a,b): a,  b ∈ Z, a – b is an  integer}.\nFind the domain and range of R.\n2.4 Functions\nIn this Section, we study a special type of relation called function. It is one of the most\nimportant concepts in mathematics. We can, visualise a function as a rule, which produces\nnew elements out of some given elements.  There are many terms such as ‘map’ or\n‘mapping’ used to denote a function.\nDefinition 5  A relation f from a set A to a set B is said to be a function if every\nelement of set A has one and only one image in set B.\nIn other words, a function f is a relation from a non-empty set A to a non-empty\nset B such that the domain of f is A and no two distinct ordered pairs in f  have the\nsame first element.\nIf f is a function from A to B and ( a, b) ∈ f, then f (a) = b, where b  is called the\nimage of a  under f  and a  is called the preimage  of b  under f.Fig 2.7\nReprint 2025-26\n\nRELATIONS AND FUNCTIONS          31\nThe function f from A to B is denoted by f: A à B.\nLooking at the previous examples, we can easily see that the relation in Example 7 is\nnot a function because the element 6 has no image.\nAgain, the relation in Example 8 is not a function because the elements in the\ndomain are connected to more than one images. Similarly , the relation in  Example 9 is\nalso not a function. ( Why?) In the examples given below , we will see many more\nrelations some of which are functions and others are not.\nExample 10\n Let N be the set of natural numbers and the relation R be defined on\nN such that  R = {( x, y) : y = 2x, x, y ∈ N}.\nWhat is the domain, codomain and range of R? Is this relation a function?\nSolution The domain of R is the set of natural numbers N. The codomain is also N.\nThe range is the set of even natural numbers.\nSince every natural number n has one and only one image, this relation is a\nfunction.\nExample 1 1 Examine each of the following relations given below and state in each\ncase, giving reasons whether it is a function or not?\n(i) R = {(2,1),(3,1), (4,2)}, (ii) R = {(2,2),(2,4),(3,3), (4,4)}\n(iii) R = {(1,2),(2,3),(3,4), (4,5), (5,6), (6,7)}\nSolution (i) Since 2, 3, 4 are the elements of domain of R having their unique images,\nthis relation R is a function.\n(ii) Since the same first element 2 corresponds to two different images 2\nand 4, this relation is not a function.\n(iii) Since every element has one and only one image, this relation is a\nfunction.\nDefinition 6 A function which has either R or one of its subsets as its range is called\na real valued function . Further , if its domain is also either R or a subset of R, it is\ncalled a real function .\nExample 12  Let N be the set of natural numbers.  Define a real valued function\nf : Nà N by f (x) = 2x  + 1. Using this definition, complete the table given below .\nx 1 2 3\n4 5 6 7\nyf (1) = ... f (2) = ... f (3) = ... f (4) = ... f (5) = ... f (6) = ... f (7) = ...\nSolution The completed table is given by\nx 1 2 3\n4 5 6 7\ny f (1) = 3 f (2) = 5 f (3) = 7 f (4) = 9 f (5) = 1 1f (6) = 13 f (7) =15\nReprint 2025-26\n\n32 MATHEMA TICS\n2.4.1  Some functions and their graphs\n(i) Identity function   Let R be the set of real numbers. Define the real valued\nfunction f : R → R by y =  f(x) = x for each x ∈ R. Such a function is called the\nidentity  function . Here the domain and range of f are R. The graph is a straight line as\nshown in Fig 2.8. It passes through the origin.\nFig 2.9Fig 2.8\n(ii) Constant function  Define the function f: R \n→ R by y = f (x) = c, x ∈ R where\nc is a constant and each x ∈ R.

For example, if f(x)=3 for each x∈R, then its\ngraph will be a line as shown in the Fig 2.9.\n(iii) Polynomial function  A function f : R → R is said to be polynomial function  if\nfor each x in \nR, y  =  f (x) = a0 + a1x  + a2x2 + ...+  an xn, where n is a non-negative\ninteger and  a0, a1, a2,...,an∈R.\nThe functions defined by f(x) = x3 – x2 + 2, and g(x) = x4 + 2x are some examples\nof polynomial functions, whereas the function h defined by h(x) = 2\n3x+ 2x is not a\npolynomial function.( Why?)\nExample 13  Define the function f: R → R by y = f (x) = x2, x ∈ R.

So, b – a ∈ Z. Therefore,\n(b, a) ∈ R\n(iii) (a, b) and (b , c)  ∈ R implies that a – b ∈ Z. b – c ∈ Z.  So,\n      a – c = (a – b ) + (b – c ) ∈ Z. Therefore, ( a,c) ∈ R\nExample 20   Let f = {(1,1), (2,3), (0, –1), (–1, –3)} be a linear function from Z into Z .\nFind f (x).\nSolution Since f is a linear function, f (x) = mx + c. Also, since (1, 1), (0 , – 1) ∈ R,\nf (1) = m + c = 1 and f (0) = c = –1.

He\nconsidered a function in terms of “mathematical job” – the “employee” being\njust a curve.\nOn July 5, 1698, Johan Bernoulli, in a letter to Leibnitz, for the first time\ndeliberately  assigned a specialised use of the term function in the analytical\nsense. At the end of that month, Leibnitz replied showing his approval.\nFunction  is found in English in 1779 in Chambers’ Cyclopaedia: “The\nterm function is used in algebra, for an analytical expression any way compounded\nof a variable quantity , and of numbers, or constant quantities”.\n—vvv\nvv—\nReprint 2025-26\n\n",
