Corti began\nhis scientific career studying the cardiovascular systems of\nreptiles. Later, he tur ned his attention to the mammalian\nauditory system. In 1851, he published a paper describing a\nstructure located on the basilar membrane of the cochlea\ncontaining hair cells that convert sound vibrations into nerve\nimpulses, the organ of Corti. He died in the year 1888.\nAlfonso Corti\n(1822 – 1888)\nReprint 2025-26\n\n183 BREATHING  AND EXCHANGE  OF GASES\nAs you have r ead earlier , oxygen (O2) is utilised by the or ganisms to\nindirectly break down simple molecules like glucose, amino acids, fatty\nacids, etc., to derive energy to perform various activities. Carbon dioxide\n(CO2) which is harmful is also released during the above catabolic\nreactions. It is, therefore, evident that O2  has to be continuously provided\nto the cells and CO2 produced by the cells have to be released out. This\nprocess of exchange of O2 from the atmosphere with CO2 produced by the\ncells is called \nbreathing, commonly known as respiration . Place your\nhands on your chest; you can feel the chest moving up and down. Y ou\nknow that it is due to breathing. How do we breathe? The respiratory\norgans and the mechanism of breathing are described in the following\nsections of this chapter .\n14.1 RESPIRATORY  ORGANS\nMechanisms of breathing vary among different groups of animals\ndepending mainly on their habitats and levels of organisation. Lower\ninvertebrates like sponges, coelenterates, flatworms, etc., exchange O2\nwith CO2 by simple diffusion over their entire body surface. Earthworms\nuse their moist cuticle and insects have a network of tubes (tracheal\ntubes) to transport atmospheric air within the body. Special vascularised\nstructures called gills (branchial respiration) are used by most of the\naquatic arthropods and molluscs whereas vascularised bags called lungs\n(pulmonary respiration) are used by the terrestrial forms for the exchange\nof gases. Among vertebrates, fishes use gills whereas amphibians , reptiles,\nbirds and mammals respire through lungs. Amphibians like frogs can\nrespire through their moist skin (cutaneous respiration) also.BREATHING AND EXCHANGE  OF GASESCHAPTER   14\n14.1 Respiratory\nOrgans\n14.2 Mechanism of\nBreathing\n14.3 Exchange of\nGases\n14.4 Transport of\nGases\n14.5 Regulation of\nRespiration\n14.6 Disorders of\nRespiratory\nSystem\nReprint 2025-26\n\n184 BIOLOGY\n14.1.1 Human Respiratory System\nWe have a pair of exter nal nostrils opening out above the upper lips.\nIt leads to a nasal chamber through the nasal passage. The nasal\nchamber opens into the pharynx , a portion of which is the common\npassage for food and air . The pharynx opens through the larynx r egion\ninto the trachea . Larynx is a cartilaginous box which helps in sound\nproduction and hence called the sound box . During swallowing glottis\ncan be covered by a thin elastic cartilaginous flap called epiglottis  to\nprevent the entry of food into the larynx. T rachea is a straight tube\nextending up to the mid-thoracic cavity, which divides at the level of\n5th thoracic vertebra into a right and left primary bronchi . Each bronchi\nundergoes repeated divisions to form the secondary and tertiary bronchi\nand bronchioles ending up in very thin terminal bronchioles . The\ntracheae, primary, secondary and tertiary bronchi, and initial\nbronchioles are supported by incomplete cartilaginous rings. Each\nterminal br onchiole gives rise to a number of very thin, irr egular -walled\nand vascularised bag-like structures called alveoli . The branching\nnetwork of bronchi, bronchioles and alveoli comprise the lungs (Figure\n14.1). W e have two lungs which ar e cover ed by a double layer ed pleura,\nwith pleural fluid between them. It reduces friction on the lung-surface.\nThe outer pleural membrane is in close contact with the thoracic\nBronchus\nLungheart\nDiaphragmEpiglottis\nLarynx\nTrachea\nCut end of rib Pleural membranes\nAlveoli\nPleural fluid\nBronchiole\nFigure 14.1 Diagrammatic view of human respiratory system (sectional view of\nthe left lung is also shown)\nReprint 2025-26\n\n185 BREATHING  AND EXCHANGE  OF GASES\nlining whereas the inner pleural membrane is in contact with the lung\nsurface. The part starting with the external nostrils up to the terminal\nbronchioles constitute the conducting part whereas the alveoli and their\nducts form the respiratory or exchange part of the respiratory system.\nThe conducting part transports the atmospheric air to the alveoli, clears\nit from foreign particles, humidifies and also brings the air to body\ntemperature. Exchange part is the site of actual diffusion of O2 and CO2\nbetween blood and atmospheric air .\nThe lungs are situated in the thoracic chamber which is anatomically\nan air -tight chamber . The thoracic chamber is for med dorsally by the\nvertebral column, ventrally by the sternum, laterally by the ribs and on\nthe lower side by the dome-shaped diaphragm. The anatomical setup of\nlungs in thorax is such that any change in the volume of the thoracic\ncavity will be reflected in the lung (pulmonary) cavity. Such an\narrangement is essential for breathing, as we cannot directly alter the\npulmonary volume.\nRespiration involves the following steps:\n(i)Breathing or pulmonary ventilation by which atmospheric air\nis drawn in and CO2 rich alveolar air is released out.\n(ii)Diffusion of gases (O2 and CO2) across alveolar membrane.\n(iii)Transport of gases by the blood.\n(iv)Diffusion of O2 and CO2 between blood and tissues.\n(v)Utilisation of O2 by the cells for catabolic reactions and resultant\nrelease of CO2 (cellular respiration as dealt in the Chapter 12).\n14.2 MECHANISM  OF BREATHING\nBreathing involves two stages : inspiration during which atmospheric\nair is drawn in and expiration by which the alveolar air is released out.\nThe movement of air into and out of the lungs is carried out by creating a\npressure gradient between the lungs and the atmosphere. Inspiration\ncan occur if the pressure within the lungs (intra-pulmonary pressure) is\nless than the atmospheric pressure, i.e., there is a negative pressure in\nthe lungs with respect to atmospheric pressure. Similarly, expiration takes\nplace when the intra-pulmonary pressure is higher than the atmospheric\npressure. The diaphragm and a specialised set of muscles – external and\ninternal intercostals between the ribs, help in generation of such gradients.\nInspiration is initiated by the contraction of diaphragm which increases\nthe volume of thoracic chamber in the antero-posterior axis. The\ncontraction of exter nal inter -costal muscles lifts up the ribs and the\nReprint 2025-26\n\n186 186186 186186 BIOLOGY\nsternum causing an increase in the volume\nof the thoracic chamber in the  dorso-ventral\naxis. The overall increase in the thoracic\nvolume causes a similar increase in\npulmonary volume. A n increase in\npulmonary volume decreases the intra-\npulmonary pressure to less than the\natmospheric pressure which forces the air\nfrom outside to move into the lungs, i.e.,\ninspiration (Figure 14.2a). Relaxation of the\ndiaphragm and the inter -costal muscles\nreturns the diaphragm and sternum to their\nnormal positions and reduce the thoracic\nvolume and thereby the pulmonary volume.\nThis leads to an increase in intra-pulmonary\npressure to slightly above the atmospheric\npressure causing the expulsion of air from\nthe lungs, i.e., expiration (F igure 14.2b). W e\nhave the ability to increase the strength of\ninspiration and expiration with the help of\nadditional muscles in the abdomen. On an\naverage, a healthy human breathes 1 2-16\ntimes/minute. The volume of air involved in\nbreathing movements can be estimated by\nusing a spirometer which helps in clinical\nassessment of pulmonary functions.\n14.2.1 14.2.114.2.114.2.114.2.1 Respiratory VRespiratory VRespiratory VRespiratory VRespiratory V olumes andolumes andolumes andolumes andolumes and\nCapacitiesCapacitiesCapacitiesCapacitiesCapacities\nTidal V\nTidal VTidal V Tidal VTidal V olume (TV): olume (TV): olume (TV): olume (TV): olume (TV): Volume of air inspired or\nexpired during a normal respiration.

Exchange of gases also\noccur between blood and tissues. O2 and CO2 are exchanged in these\nsites by simple diffusion mainly based on pressure/concentration\ngradient. Solubility of the gases as well as the thickness of the membranes\ninvolved in diffusion are also some important factors that can affect the\nrate of diffusion.\nPressure contributed by an individual gas in a mixture of gases is\ncalled partial pressure and is represented as pO2 for oxygen and pCO2 for\ncarbon dioxide. Partial pressures of these two gases in the atmospheric\nair and the two sites of diffusion are given in Table 14.1 and in\nFigure 14.3. The data given in the table clearly indicates a concentration\ngradient for oxygen from alveoli to blood and blood to tissues. Similarly,\nTABLE 14.1 Partial Pressures (in mm Hg) of Oxygen and Carbon dioxide at Different\nParts Involved in Diffusion in Comparison to those in Atmosphere\nRespiratory Atmospheric Alveoli Blood Blood Tissues\nGas Air (Deoxygenated) (Oxygenated)\nO2159 104 40 95 40\nCO20.3 40 45 40 45\nReprint 2025-26\n\n188 BIOLOGY\na gradient is present for CO2 in the opposite direction, i.e., from tissues to\nblood and blood  to alveoli. As the solubility of CO2 is 20-25 times higher\nthan that of O2, the amount of CO2 that can diffuse through the diffusion\nmembrane per unit difference in partial pressure is much higher compared\nto that of O2. The diffusion membrane\nis made up of three major layers\n(Figure 14.4) namely, the thin squamous\nepithelium of alveoli, the endothelium of\nalveolar capillaries and the basement\nsubstance (composed of a thin basement\nmembrane supporting the squamous\nepithelium and the basement membrane\nsurrounding the single layer endothelial\ncells of capillaries)  in between them.\nHowever , its total thickness is much less\nthan a millimetre. Therefore, all the factors\nin our body are favourable for diffusion of\nO2 from alveoli to tissues and that of CO2\nfrom tissues to alveoli.Figure 14.4 A Diagram of a section of an\nalveolus with a pulmonary\ncapillary.Figure 14.3 Diagrammatic representation of exchange of gases at the alveolus and\nthe body tissues with blood and transport of oxygen and carbon dioxide\nReprint 2025-26\n\n189 BREATHING  AND EXCHANGE  OF GASES\n14.4 TRANSPORT  OF GASES\nBlood is the medium of transport for O2 and CO2. About 97 per cent of O2 is\ntransported by RBCs in the blood. The remaining 3 per cent of O2 is carried\nin a dissolved state through the plasma. Nearly 20-25 per cent of CO2 is\ntransported by RBC s whereas 70 per cent of it is carried as bicarbonate.\nAbout 7 per cent of CO2 is carried in a dissolved state through plasma.\n14.4.1 Transport of Oxygen\nHaemoglobin is a red coloured iron containing pigment present in the\nRBCs. O2 can bind with haemoglobin in a reversible manner to form\noxyhaemoglobin . Each haemoglobin molecule can carry a maximum of\nfour molecules of O2. Binding of oxygen with haemoglobin is primarily\nrelated to partial pressure of O2. Partial pressure of CO2, hydrogen ion\nconcentration and temperature are the other factors which can interfere\nwith this binding. A sigmoid curve is obtained when percentage saturation\nof haemoglobin with O2 is plotted against the\npO2. This curve is called the Oxygen\ndissociation curve (Figure 14.5) and is highly\nuseful in studying the effect of factors like\npCO2, H+ concentration, etc., on binding of O2\nwith haemoglobin. In the alveoli, where there\nis high pO2, low pCO2, lesser H+ concentration\nand lower temperature, the factors are\nall favourable for the formation of\noxyhaemoglobin, whereas in the tissues,\nwhere low pO2, high pCO2, high H+\nconcentration and higher temperature exist,\nthe conditions are favourable for dissociation\nof oxygen from the oxyhaemoglobin. This\nclearly indicates that O2 gets bound to\nhaemoglobin in the lung surface and gets\ndissociated at the tissues. Every 100 ml of\noxygenated blood can deliver around 5 ml of\nO2 to the tissues under normal physiological\nconditions.\n14.4.2   Transport of Carbon dioxide\nCO2 is carried by haemoglobin as carbamino-haemoglobin (about\n20-25 per cent). This binding is related to the partial pressure of CO2.\npO2 is a major factor which could affect this binding. When pCO2 is high\nand pO2 is low as in the tissues, more binding of carbon dioxide occurs\nwhereas, when the pCO2 is low and pO2 is high as in the alveoli, dissociation20\n0 2040\n4060\n6080\n80100\n100\nPartial pressure of oxygen (mm Hg)Percentage saturation of haemoglobin with oxygen\nFigure 14.5  Oxygen dissociation curve\nReprint 2025-26\n\n190 BIOLOGY\nof CO2 from carbamino-haemoglobin takes place, i.e., CO2 which is bound\nto haemoglobin from the tissues is delivered at the alveoli. RBCs contain\na very high concentration of the enzyme, carbonic anhydrase and minute\nquantities of the same is present in the plasma too. This enzyme facilitates\nthe following reaction in both directions.\nCO H O H COCarbonic\nanhyd\nraseCarbonic\nanhydra\n2 2 2 3 +  → ← s seHCO H  → ←  +− +\n3\nAt the tissue site where partial pressure of CO2 is high due to\ncatabolism, CO2 diffuses into blood (RBCs and plasma) and forms HCO3–\nand H+,. At the alveolar site where pCO2 is low, the reaction proceeds in\nthe opposite direction leading to the formation of CO2 and H2O. Thus,\nCO2 trapped as bicarbonate at the tissue level and transported to the\nalveoli is released out as CO2 (Figure 14.4). Every 100 ml of deoxygenated\nblood delivers approximately 4 ml of CO2 to the alveoli.\n14.5 REGULATION  OF RESPIRATION\nHuman beings have a significant ability to maintain and moderate the\nrespiratory rhythm to suit the demands of the body tissues. This is done\nby the neural system. A specialised centre present in the medulla region\nof the brain called respiratory rhythm centre is primarily responsible for\nthis regulation. Another centre present in the pons region of the brain\ncalled pneumotaxic centre can moderate the functions of the respiratory\nrhythm centre. Neural signal from this centre can reduce the duration of\ninspiration and thereby alter the respiratory rate. A chemosensitive area\nis situated adjacent to the rhythm centre which is highly sensitive to CO2\nand hydrogen ions. Increase in these substances can activate this centre,\nwhich in turn can signal the rhythm centre to make necessary adjustments\nin the respiratory process by which these substances can be eliminated.\nReceptors associated with aortic arch and carotid artery also can recognise\nchanges in CO2 and H+ concentration and send necessary signals to the\nrhythm centre for remedial actions. The role of oxygen in the regulation of\nrespiratory rhythm is quite insignificant.\n14.6 DISORDERS  OF RESPIRATORY  SYSTEM\nAsthma is a difficulty in breathing causing wheezing due to inflammation\nof bronchi and bronchioles.\nEmphysema is a chronic disorder in which alveolar walls are damaged\ndue to which respiratory surface is decreased. One of the major causes of\nthis is cigarette smoking.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n191 BREATHING  AND EXCHANGE  OF GASES\nSUMMARY\nCells utilise oxygen for metabolism and produce energy along with substances\nlike carbon dioxide which is harmful. Animals have evolved different mechanisms\nfor the transport of oxygen to the cells and for the removal of carbon dioxide from\nthere. We have a well developed r espiratory system comprising two lungs and\nassociated air passages to perform this function.\nThe first step in respiration is breathing by which atmospheric air is taken in\n(inspiration) and the alveolar air is released out (expiration). Exchange of O2 and\nCO2 between deoxygenated blood and alveoli, transport of these gases throughout\nthe body by blood, exchange of O2 and CO2 between the oxygenated blood and\ntissues and utilisation of O2 by the cells (cellular respiration) are the other steps\ninvolved.\nInspiration and expiration are carried out by creating pressure gradients\nbetween the atmosphere and the alveoli with the help of specialised muscles –\nintercostals and diaphragm. V olumes of air involved in these activities can be\nestimated with the help of spirometer and are of clinical significance.\nExchange of O2 and CO2 at the alveoli and tissues occur by diffusion. Rate of\ndiffusion is dependent on the partial pressure gradients of O2 (pO2) and CO2 (pCO2),\ntheir solubility as well as the thickness of the diffusion surface. These factors in\nour body facilitate diffusion of O2 from the alveoli to the deoxygenated blood as\nwell as from the oxygenated blood to the tissues. The factors are favourable for the\ndiffusion of CO2 in the opposite direction, i.e., from tissues to alveoli.\nOxygen is transported mainly as oxyhaemoglobin. In the alveoli where pO2 is\nhigher , O2 gets bound to haemoglobin which is easily dissociated at the tissues\nwhere pO2 is low and pCO2 and H+ concentration are high. Nearly 70 per cent of\ncarbon dioxide is transported as bicarbonate (HCO3–) with the help of the enzyme\ncarbonic anhydrase. 20-25 per cent of carbon dioxide is carried by haemoglobin\nas carbamino-haemoglobin. In the tissues where pCO2 is high, it gets bound to\nblood whereas in the alveoli where pCO2 is low and pO2 is high, it gets removed\nfrom the blood.\nRespiratory rhythm is maintained by the respiratory centre in the medulla\nregion of brain. A pneumotaxic centre in the pons region of the brain and a\nchemosensitive area in the medulla can alter respiratory mechanism.Occupational Respiratory Disorders:  In certain industries, especially\nthose involving grinding or stone-breaking, so much dust is produced\nthat the defense mechanism of the body cannot fully cope with the\nsituation. Long exposure can give rise to inflammation leading to fibrosis\n(proliferation of fibrous tissues) and thus causing serious lung damage.\nWorkers in such industries should wear pr otective masks.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n192 BIOLOGY\nEXERCISES\n1.Define vital capacity.
