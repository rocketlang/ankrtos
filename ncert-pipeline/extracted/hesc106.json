The testes\nproduce the male gametes called\nsperms . Millions of sperms are produced\nby the testes. Look at Fig. 6.2 which\nshows the picture of a sperm. Though\nsperms are very small in size, each has\na head, a middle piece and a tail. Does\nit appear to be a single cell? Indeed, eachsperm is a single cell with all the usual\ncell components.\nFig. 6.1: Male reproductive\norgans in humansWhat purpose does the\ntail in a sperm serve?\nFig. 6.3 : Female reproductive organs in\nhumansFemale Reproductive Organs\nThe female reproductive organs are a pair\nof ovaries, oviducts (fallopian tubes) and\nthe uterus (Fig. 6.3). The ovary produces\nOviduct\nOvary\nUterus\nHead\nMiddle piece\nTail\nFig. 6.2 :  Human sperm\nREPRODUCTION  IN ANIMALS 67\nSperm\nduct\nTestisPenis\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 68Boojho recalls that the size\nof eggs in animals varies.\nThe egg may be very small\nas in humans, much larger\nas in hens. Ostrich egg is\nthe largest!\nFertilisation\nThe first step in the process of\nreproduction is the fusion of a sperm\nand an ovum. When sperms come in\ncontact with an egg, one of the sperms\nmay fuse with the egg. Such fusion of\nthe egg and the sperm is called\nfertilisation (Fig. 6.5). During\nfertilisation, the nuclei of the sperm and\nthe egg fuse to form a single nucleus.\nThis results in the formation of a\nfertilised egg or zygote (Fig. 6.6). Did\nFig. 6.5 :  Fertilisation\nFig. 6.4 :  Human OvumNucleusSperms\nOvum\nFusing\nnuclei\nThe process of fertilisation is the\nmeeting of an egg cell from the mother\nand a sper m cell fr om the father . So,\nthe new individual inherits some\ncharacteristics  from the mother and\nsome fr om the father . Look at your\nbrother or sister . See if you can r ecognise\nsome characters in them similar to those\nof your mother or your father .\nFertilisation which takes place inside\nthe female body is called internal\nfertilisation . Internal fertilisation\noccurs in many animals including\nhumans, cows, dogs and hens.Fig. 6.6 :  Zygotefemale gametes called ova (eggs)\n(Fig. 6.4). In human beings, a single\nmatured egg is released into the oviduct\nby one of the ovaries every month.\nUterus is the part where development of\nthe baby takes place. Like the sperm,\nan egg is also a single cell.\nyou know that the zygote is the\nbeginning of a new individual?\n2024-25\n\nREPRODUCTION  IN ANIMALS 69Why do fish and\nfrogs lay eggs in\nhundreds whereas a\nhen lays only one\negg at a time?\nHave you heard of\ntest tube babies?\nBoojho and Paheli’s teacher once told\nthem in the class that in some women\noviducts are blocked. These women\nare unable to bear babies because\nsperms cannot reach the egg for\nfertilisation. In such cases, doctors\ncollect freshly released egg and\nsperms and keep them together for a\nfew hours for IVF or in vitro\nfertilisation  (fertilisation outside the\nbody). In case fertilisation occurs,\nthe zygote is allowed to develop for\nabout a week and then it is placed in\nthe mother’s uterus. Complete\ndevelopment takes place in the uterus\nand the baby is born like any other\nbaby. Babies born through this\ntechnique are called test-tube\nbabies . This term is actually\nmisleading because babies cannot\ngrow in test tubes.female lays hundreds of eggs. Unlike\nhen’s egg, frog’s egg is not covered by a\nshell and it is comparatively very\ndelicate. A layer of jelly holds the eggs\ntogether and provides protection to the\neggs (Fig. 6.7).\nYou will be surprised to know that\nin many animals fertili sation takes\nplace outside the body of the female.\nIn these animals, fertili sation takes\nplace in water . Let us find out how\nthis happens.\nActivity 6.1\nVisit some ponds or slow-flowing\nstreams during spring or rainy\nseason. Look out for clusters of\nfrog’s eggs floating in water .\nWrite down the colour and size of\nthe eggs.\nDuring spring or rainy season, frogs\nand toads move to ponds and slow-\nflowing streams. When the male and\nfemale come together in water , theAs the eggs are laid, the male\ndeposits sperms over them. Each\nsperm swims randomly in water with\nthe help of its long tail. The sperms\ncome in contact with the eggs. This\nresults in fertili sation. This type of\nfertilis ation in which the fusion of a\nmale and a female gamete takes place\noutside the body of the female is called\nexternal fertili sation . It is very\ncommon in aquatic animals such as\nfish, star fish\n, etc.\nFig. 6.7 :  Eggs of frog\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 70\nDevelopment of Embryo\nFertilisation results in the formation of\nzygote which begins to develop into an\nembryo [Fig. 6.8(a)]. The zygote divides\nrepeatedly to give rise to a ball of cells\n[Fig. 6.8(b)]. The cells then begin to form\ngroups that develop into different tissues\nand organs of the body. This developing\nstructure is termed an embryo . The\nembryo gets embedded in the wall of the\nuterus for further development\n[Fig. 6.8(c)].\nThe embryo continues to develop in\nthe uterus. It gradually develops body\nFig. 6.8 : (a) Zygote formation and development of an embryo from the zygote; (b) Ball of cells\n(enlarged); (c) Embedding of the embryo in the uterus (enlarged)How could a single cell\nbecome such a big\nindividual?\n(b)\n(a)\n(c)Uterus\nEmbedding\nembryoOvary\nOvulationZygote\nUterus\nwall\nDeveloping\nembryo\nThough these animals lay\nhundreds of eggs and release\nmillions of sperms, all the eggs\ndo not get fertilised and develop\ninto new individuals.\nThis is because the eggs and\nsperms get exposed to  water\nmovement, wind and rainfall.\nAlso, there are other animals in\nthe pond which may feed\non eggs. Thus, production\nof large number of eggs and\nsperms is necessary to\nensure fertilisation\nof at least\na few of them.\n2024-25\n\nREPRODUCTION  IN ANIMALS 71parts such as hands, legs, head, eyes,\nears etc. The stage of the embryo in\nwhich all the body parts can be\nidentified is called a foetus (Fig. 6.9).\nWhen the development of the foetus is\ncomplete,  the mother gives birth to\nthe baby.place inside the egg shell during this\nperiod? After the chick is completely\ndeveloped it bursts open the egg shell.\nIn animals which undergo external\nfertilisation, development of the embryo\ntakes place outside the female body. The\nembryos continue to grow within their\negg coverings. After the embryos develop,\nthe eggs hatch. Y\nou must have seen\nnumerous tadpoles swimming in ponds\nand streams.\nViviparous and Oviparous Animals\nWe have learnt that some animals give\nbirth to young ones while some animals\nlay eggs which later develop into young\nones. The animals which give birth to\nyoung ones are called viviparous\nanimals. Those animals which lay eggs\nare called oviparous animals. The\nfollowing activity will help you\nunderstand better and differentiate\nbetween viviparous and oviparous\nanimals.\nActivity 6.2\nTry to observe eggs of the following\norganisms – fr og, lizar d, butter fly\nor moth, hen and crow or any other\nbir\nd. Were you able to observe eggs\nof all of them? Make drawings of  the\neggs that you have observed.\nThe eggs of a few animals are easy\nto observe because their mothers lay\nthem outside their bodies. These are\nexamples of oviparous animals. But you\nwould not be able to collect the eggs of\na dog, cow or cat. This is because they\ndo not lay eggs. The mother gives birth\nto the young ones. These are examples\nof viviparous animals.Internal fertilisation takes place in\nhens also. But, do hens give birth to\nbabies like human beings and cows? Y ou\nknow that they do not. Then, how are\nchicks born? Let us find out.\nSoon after fertilisation, the zygote\ndivides repeatedly and travels down the\noviduct. As it travels down, many\nprotective layers are formed around it.\nThe hard shell that you see in a hen’s\negg is one such pr otective layer .\nAfter the hard shell is formed around\nthe developing embryo, the hen finally\nlays the egg. The embryo takes about 3\nweeks to develop into a chick. Y ou must\nhave seen the hen sitting on the eggs to\nprovide sufficient warmth. Did you know\nthat development of the chick takesFig. 6.9 :  Foetus in the uterusUterus\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 72Can you now give some more\nexamples of viviparous and oviparous\nanimals?\nYoung Ones to Adults\nThe new individuals which are born or\nhatched from the eggs continue to grow\ntill they become adults. In some\nanimals, the young ones may look very\ndifferent from the adults. The life cycle\nof frog is shown in Fig. 6.10.\nObserve the different stages of frog\nstarting from the egg to the adult stage.\nWe find that ther e are thr ee distinct\nstages, that is, egg → tadpole (larva) →\nadult. Don’t the tadpoles look so\ndifferent from the adults? Can you\nimagine that these tadpoles would some\nday become frogs?The tadpoles transform into adults\ncapable of jumping and swimming. The\ntransformation of the larva into an adult\nthrough drastic changes is called\nmetamorphosis . What about the\nchanges that we observe in our body as\nwe grow? Do you think we too undergo\nmetamorphosis? In human beings,\nbody parts similar to those present in\nthe adults are present from the time\nof birth.\n6.3 Asexual Reproduction\nSo far , we have lear nt about r eproduction\nin some familiar animals. But what\nabout very small animals like hydra and\nmicroscopic organisms like amoeba? Do\nyou know how they reproduce? Let us\nfind out.\nFig. 6.10 :  Life cycle of frog\n(a) Eggs(b) Early tadpole\n(c) Late tadpole\n(d) Adult frog\n2024-25\n\nREPRODUCTION  IN ANIMALS 73\nActivity 6.3\nGet permanent slides of\nhydra.  Observe them using\nhand lens or a microscope.\nLook out for any bulges\nfrom the parent body.\nCount the number of\nbulges that you see in\ndifferent slides. Also, note\nthe size of the bulges. Draw\nthe diagram of hydra, as\nyou see it. Compare it with\nthe Fig. 6.11.Fig. 6.11 :  Budding in Hydra\nFig. 6.12 :  Binary fission in Amoeba(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)Dividing nucleus\nDaughter amoebaeIn each hydra, there may be one or\nmore  bulges. These bulges are the\ndeveloping new individuals and they are\ncalled buds. Recall the presence of buds\nin yeast. In hydra too the new individuals\ndevelop as outgrowths from a single\nparent. This type of reproduction in\nwhich only a single parent is involved is\ncalled asexual reproduction . Since new\nindividuals develop from the buds in\nhydra, this type of asexual reproduction\nis called budding .\nAnother method of asexual\nreproduction is observed in the\nmicroscopic organism, amoeba. Let us\nsee how this happens.\nYou have alr eady lear nt about the\nstructur e of amoeba. Y ou will r ecall that\namoeba is a single-celled organism\n[Fig. 6.12(a)]. It begins the process of\nreproduction by the division of its\nnucleus into two nuclei [Fig. 6.12(b)].\nThis is followed by division of its body\ninto two, each part receiving a nucleus\n[Fig. 6.12(c)]. Finally, two amoebae are\nproduced from one parent amoeba\n[Fig. 6.12(d)]. This type of asexual\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 74Story of Dolly, the Clone\nCloning is the production of an exact copy of a cell, any other living part, or a\ncomplete organism. Cloning of an animal was successfully performed for the first\ntime by Ian Wilmut and his colleagues at the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh,\nScotland. They successfully cloned a sheep named Dolly [Fig. 6.13 (c)]. Dolly was\nborn on 5th July 1996 and was the first mammal to be cloned.\n(a) Finn Dorsett sheep (b) Scottish blackface ewe (c) Dolly\nFig. 6.13\nDuring the process of cloning Dolly, a cell was collected from the mammary gland\nof a female Finn Dorsett sheep [Fig. 6.13 (a)]. Simultaneously, an egg was obtained\nfrom a Scottish blackface ewe [Fig. 6.13 (b)]. The nucleus was removed from the\negg. Then, the nucleus of the mammary gland cell from the Finn Dorsett sheep\nwas inserted into the egg of the Scottish blackface ewe whose nucleus had been\nremoved. The egg thus produced was implanted into the Scottish blackface ewe.\nDevelopment of this egg followed normally and finally Dolly was born. Though\nDolly was given birth by the Scottish blackface ewe, it was found to be absolutely\nidentical to the Finn Dorsett sheep from which the nucleus was taken. Since the\nnucleus from the egg of the Scottish blackface ewe was removed, Dolly did not\nshow any character of the Scottish blackface ewe. Dolly was a healthy clone of\nthe Finn Dorsett sheep and produced several offspring of her own through normal\nsexual means. Unfortunately, Dolly died on 14th February 2003 due to a certain\nlung disease.\nSince Dolly, several attempts have been made to produce cloned mammals.\nHowever , many die befor e birth or die soon after birth. The cloned animals ar e\nmany-a-times found to be born with severe abnormalities.\nreproduction in which an animal\nreproduces by dividing into two\nindividuals is called binary fission .\nApart from budding and binary fission,there are other methods by which a\nsingle parent reproduces young ones.\nYou will study about these in your\nhigher classes.\n2024-25\n\nREPRODUCTION  IN ANIMALS 75\n KEYWORDS KEYWORDS KEYWORDS KEYWORDS KEYWORDS\nASEXUAL\nREPRODUCTION\nBINARY FISSION\nBUDDING\nEGGS\nEMBRYO\nEXTERNAL\nFERTILISA TION\nFERTILISA TION\nFOETUS\nINTERNAL\nFERTILISA TION\nMETAMORPHOSIS\nOVIPAROUS ANIMALS\nSEXUAL\nREPRODUCTION\nSPERMS\nVIVIP AROUS ANIMALS\nZYGOTE WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT\nÜThere are two modes by which animals repro-\nduce.

After a day or\nso you may see several hydra clinging to the sides of the jar .\nHydra is transparent, jelly-like and with tentacles. It clings to the\njar with the base of its body. If the jar is shaken, the hydra will\ncontract instantly into a small blob, at the same time drawing its\ntentacles in.\nNow take out few hydras from the jar and put them on a watch\nglass.

Only one bee i n the colony lays eggs. This bee is called the\nqueen bee. All other female bees are worker bees. Their main job is to build the\nhive, look after the young and feed the queen bee adequately to keep her\nhealthy so that she can lay eggs. A queen bee lays thousands of eggs. The\nfertili sed eggs hatch into females, while the unfertili sed eggs give rise to males ,\ncalled drones. It is the job of the worker bees to maintain the temperature of\nthe hive at around 35 °C to incubate the eggs.\n2024-25\n\n",
