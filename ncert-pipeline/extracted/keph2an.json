To raise the temperature\nof the gas by a certain amount, heat is to be supplied to increase the average energy of\nall the modes. Consequently, molar specific heat of diatomic  gases is more than that of\nmonatomic gases. It can be shown that if only rotational modes of motion are considered,\nthe molar specific heat of diatomic gases is nearly (5/2) R which agrees with the\nobservations for all the gases listed in the table, except chlorine. The higher value of\nmolar specific heat of chlori ne indicates that besides rotational modes, vibrational modes\nare also present in chlorine at room temperature.\n10.16 4.3 g/min\n10.17 3.7 kg\n10.18 238 °C\n10.20 9 min\nReprint 2025-26\n\nANSWERS 303\n",
