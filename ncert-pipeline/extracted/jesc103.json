      "title": ", how copper oxide reacts with hydrochloric acid.",
      "content": "Chapter 2, how copper oxide reacts with hydrochloric acid.\nWe have lear nt that metal oxides ar e basic in natur e. But some metal\noxides, such as aluminium oxide, zinc oxide show both acidic as well as\nbasic behaviour . Such metal oxides which r eact with both acids as well as\nbases to produce salts and water are known as amphoteric oxides.\nAluminium oxide reacts in the following manner with acids and bases –\nAl2O3 + 6HCl →2AlCl3+3H2O\nAl2O3 + 2NaOH →2NaAlO2+H2O\n(Sodium\naluminate)\n Most metal oxides are insoluble in water but some of these dissolve\nin water to form alkalis. Sodium oxide and potassium oxide dissolve in\nwater to produce alkalis as follows –\nNa2O(s) +H2O(l) → 2NaOH(aq)\nK2O(s) +H2O(l) → 2KOH(aq)\nReprint 2025-26\n\nScience 42We have observed in Activity 3.9 that all metals do not r eact with\noxygen at the same rate. Different metals show different reactivities\ntowards oxygen. Metals such as potassium and sodium react so\nvigorously that they catch fire if kept in the open. Hence, to protect them\nand to prevent accidental fires, they are kept immersed in kerosene oil.\nAt ordinary temperature, the surfaces of metals such as magnesium,\naluminium, zinc, lead, etc., are covered with a thin layer of oxide. The\nprotective oxide layer prevents the metal from further oxidation. Iron\ndoes not burn on heating but iron filings burn vigorously when sprinkled\nin the flame of the bur ner. Copper does not bur n, but the hot metal is\ncoated with a black coloured layer of copper(II) oxide. Silver and gold do\nnot react with oxygen even at high temperatures.Do Y ou Know?Anodising is a process of forming a thick oxide layer of aluminium. Aluminium\ndevelops a thin oxide layer when exposed to air . This aluminium oxide coat makes it\nresistant to further corrosion.  The resistance can be improved further by making the\noxide layer thicker .  During anodising, a clean aluminium article is made the anode\nand is electrolysed with dilute sulphuric acid. The oxygen gas evolved at the anode\nreacts with aluminium to make a thicker pr otective oxide layer .  This oxide layer can\nbe dyed easily to give aluminium articles an attractive finish.\nAfter performing Activity 3.9, you must have observed that sodium\nis the most reactive of the samples of metals taken here. The reaction of\nmagnesium is less vigorous implying that it is not as reactive as sodium.\nBut burning in oxygen does not help us to decide about the reactivity of\nzinc, iron, copper or lead. Let us see some more reactions to arrive at a\nconclusion about the order of reactivity of these metals.\n3.2.2 What happens when Metals react with W ater?\nActivity 3.10Activity 3.10Activity 3.10Activity 3.10Activity 3.10\nCAUTION:  This Activity needs the teacher’s assistance.\n/square6Collect the samples of the same metals as in Activity 3.9.\n/square6Put small pieces of the samples separately in beakers half-filled\nwith cold water .\n/square6Which metals reacted with cold water? Arrange them in the\nincreasing or der of their r eactivity with cold water .\n/square6Did any metal produce fire on water?\n/square6Does any metal start floating after some time?\n/square6Put the metals that did not react with cold water in beakers\nhalf-filled with hot water .\n/square6For the metals that did not r eact with hot water , arrange the\napparatus as shown in Fig.  3.3 and observe their reaction with steam.\n/square6Which metals did not react even with steam?\n/square6Arrange the metals in the decr easing or der of r eactivity with water .\nReprint 2025-26\n\nMetals and Non-metals 43Metals react with water and produce a metal oxide and hydrogen\ngas. Metal oxides that are soluble in water dissolve in it to further form\nmetal hydr oxide. But all metals do not r eact with water .\nMetal +Water →Metal oxide + Hydrogen\nMetal oxide +Water →Metal hydroxide\nMetals like potassium and sodium r eact violently with cold water . In\ncase of sodium and potassium, the reaction is so violent and exothermic\nthat the evolved hydrogen immediately catches fire.\n2K(s)   + 2H2O(l) →  2KOH(aq)  +  H2(g) + heat energy\n2Na(s) + 2H2O(l) → 2NaOH(aq) + H2(g) + heat energy\nThe reaction of calcium with water is less violent. The heat evolved is\nnot sufficient for the hydrogen to catch fire.\nCa(s) + 2H2O(l) → Ca(OH)2(aq) + H2(g)\nCalcium starts floating because the bubbles of hydrogen gas formed\nstick to the surface of the metal.\nMagnesium does not react with cold water . It reacts with hot water\nto form magnesium hydroxide and hydrogen. It also starts floating due\nto the bubbles of hydrogen gas sticking to its surface.\nMetals like aluminium, iron and zinc do not react either with cold or\nhot water . But they r eact with steam to for m the metal oxide and hydr ogen.\n2Al(s) +3H2O(g) → Al2O3(s) + 3H2(g)\n3Fe(s) +4H2O(g) → Fe3O4(s) + 4H2(g)\nMetals such as  lead, copper , silver and gold do not r eact with water at all.\n3.2.3 What happens when Metals react with Acids?\nYou have alr eady lear nt that metals r eact with acids to give a salt and\nhydrogen gas.Figure 3.3Figure 3.3Figure 3.3Figure 3.3Figure 3.3  Action of steam on a metal\nReprint 2025-26\n\nScience 44Metal + Dilute acid →  Salt + Hydrogen\nBut do all metals react in the same manner? Let us find out.\nActivity 3.11Activity 3.11Activity 3.11Activity 3.11Activity 3.11\n/square6Collect all the metal samples except sodium and potassium again.\nIf the samples ar e tar nished, rub them clean with sand paper .\nCAUTION:  Do not take sodium and potassium as they react\nvigorously even with cold water .\n/square6Put the samples separately in test tubes containing dilute\nhydrochloric acid.\n/square6Suspend thermometers in the test tubes, so that their bulbs are\ndipped in the acid.\n/square6Observe the rate of formation of bubbles carefully.\n/square6Which metals reacted vigorously with dilute hydrochloric acid?\n/square6With which metal did you record the highest temperature?\n/square6Arrange the metals in the decreasing order of reactivity with dilute\nacids.\nWrite equations for the r eactions of magnesium, aluminium, zinc\nand iron with dilute hydrochloric acid.\nHydrogen gas is not evolved when a metal reacts with nitric acid. It is\nbecause HNO3 is a strong oxidising agent. It oxidises the H2 produced to\nwater and itself gets reduced to any of the nitrogen oxides (N2O, NO,\nNO2). But magnesium (Mg) and manganese (Mn) react with very dilute\nHNO3 to evolve H2 gas.\nYou must have observed in Activity 3.11, that the rate of for mation\nof bubbles was the fastest in the case of magnesium. The reaction was\nalso the most exothermic in this case. The reactivity decreases in the\norder Mg > Al > Zn > Fe. In the case of copper , no bubbles wer e seen and\nthe temperature also remained unchanged. This shows that copper does\nnot react with dilute HCl.Do Y ou Know?Aqua regia,  (Latin for ‘royal water’) is a freshly prepared mixture of concentrated\nhydrochloric acid and concentrated nitric acid in the ratio of 3:1. It can dissolve\ngold, even though neither of these acids can do so alone. Aqua regia  is a highly\ncorrosive, fuming liquid. It is one of the few reagents that is able to dissolve gold and\nplatinum.\n3.2.4 How do Metals react with Solutions of other Metal\nSalts?\nActivity 3.12Activity 3.12Activity 3.12Activity 3.12Activity 3.12\n/square6Take a clean wire of copper and an iron nail.\n/square6Put the copper wire in a solution of iron sulphate and the iron\nnail in a solution of copper sulphate taken in test tubes (Fig. 3.4).\n/square6Record your observations after 20 minutes.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nMetals and Non-metals 45/square6In which test tube did you find that a reaction has occurred?\n/square6On what basis can you say that a reaction has actually taken\nplace?\n/square6Can you correlate your observations for the Activities 3.9, 3.10\nand 3.11?\n/square6Write a balanced chemical equation for the r eaction that has taken\nplace.\n/square6Name the type of reaction.\nReactive metals can displace less\nreactive metals from their compounds in\nsolution or molten form.\nWe have seen in the pr evious sections\nthat all metals ar e not equally r eactive. W e\nchecked the reactivity of various metals\nwith oxygen, water and acids. But all\nmetals do not react with these reagents.\nSo we were not able to put all the metal\nsamples we had collected in decreasing\norder of their reactivity. Displacement\nreactions studied in Chapter 1 give better\nevidence about the reactivity of metals. It\nis simple and easy if metal A displaces\nmetal B from its solution, it is more reactive than B.\nMetal A + Salt solution of B →  Salt solution of A + Metal B\nWhich metal, copper or iron, is more reactive according to your\nobservations in Activity 3.12?\n3.2.5 The Reactivity Series\nThe reactivity series is a list of metals arranged in the order of their\ndecreasing activities. After performing displacement experiments\n(Activities 1.9 and 3.12), the following series, (Table 3.2) known as the\nreactivity or activity series has been developed.\nTable 3.2 Activity series : Relative reactivities of metals\nK Potassium Most reactive\nNa Sodium\nCa Calcium\nMg Magnesium\nAl Aluminium\nZn Zinc Reactivity decreases\nFe Iron\nPb Lead\n[H] [Hydrogen]\nCu Copper\nHg Mercury\nAg Silver\nAu Gold Least reactiveFigure 3.4Figure 3.4Figure 3.4Figure 3.4Figure 3.4\nReaction of metals with\nsalt solutions\nReprint 2025-26\n\nScience 46?QUESTIONS\n1.

W e, ther efore, explain the r eactivity of elements\nas a tendency to attain a completely filled valence shell.\nLet us have a look at the electronic configuration of noble gases and\nsome metals and non-metals.\nWe can see fr om Table 3.3 that a sodium atom has one electr on in its\noutermost shell. If it loses the electron from its M shell then its L shell\nnow becomes the outermost shell and that has a stable octet. The nucleus\nof this atom still has 11 protons but the number of electrons has\nbecome 10, so there is a net positive charge giving us a sodium cation\nNa+.

If sodium and chlorine\nwere to react, the electron lost by sodium could be taken up by chlorine.\nAfter gaining an electron, the chlorine atom gets a unit negative charge,\nbecause its nucleus has 17 protons and there are 18 electrons in its K, L\nand M shells.  This gives us a chloride anion C1–.

These compounds are generally brittle and\nbreak into pieces when pressure is applied.\n(ii)Melting and Boiling points : Ionic compounds have high melting\nand boiling points (see Table 3.4). This is because a considerable\namount of ener gy is r equir ed to br eak the str ong inter -ionic\nattraction.\n(iii) Solubility : Electrovalent compounds are generally soluble in\nwater and insoluble in solvents such as kerosene, petrol, etc.\n(iv)Conduction of Electricity : The conduction of electricity through\na solution involves the movement of charged particles. A solution\nof an ionic compound in water contains ions, which move to the\nopposite electrodes when electricity is passed through the\nsolution. Ionic compounds in the solid state do not conduct\nelectricity because movement of ions in the solid is not possible\ndue to their rigid structure. But ionic compounds conduct\nelectricity in the molten state. This is possible in the molten state\nsince the elecrostatic forces of attraction between the oppositely\ncharged ions are overcome due to the heat. Thus, the ions move\nfreely and conduct electricity.\nQUESTIONS\n?1.

Why do ionic compounds have high melting points?\n3.4 3.43.4 3.43.4OCCURRENCE OF METOCCURRENCE OF METOCCURRENCE OF METOCCURRENCE OF METOCCURRENCE OF MET ALSALSALS\nALSALS\nThe earth’s crust is the major source of metals. Seawater also contains\nsome soluble salts such as sodium chloride, magnesium chloride, etc.\nThe elements or compounds, which occur naturally in the earth’s crust,\nare known as minerals. At some places, minerals contain a very high\npercentage of a particular metal and the metal can be profitably extracted\nfrom it. These minerals are called ores.\n3.4.1 Extraction of Metals\nYou have lear nt about the r eactivity series of metals. Having this\nknowledge, you can easily understand how a metal is extracted from its\nore. Some metals are found in the earth’s crust in the free state. Some\nare found in the form of their compounds. The metals at the bottom of\nthe activity series are the least reactive. They are often found in a free\nReprint 2025-26\n\nScience 50state. For example, gold, silver , platinum and copper ar e found in the\nfree state. Copper and silver are also found in the combined state as\ntheir sulphide or oxide ores. The metals at the top of the activity series\n(K, Na, Ca, Mg and Al) are so reactive that they are never found in\nnature as free elements. The metals in the middle of the activity series\n(Zn, Fe, Pb, etc.) are moderately reactive. They are found in the earth’s\ncrust mainly as oxides, sulphides or carbonates. Y ou will find that\nthe ores of many metals are oxides. This is because oxygen is a very\nreactive element and is very abundant on the earth.\nThus on th e basis of reactivity, we can group the metals into the\nfollowing three categories (Fig. 3.9) – (i) Metals of low reactivity; (ii) Metals\nof medium reactivity; (iii) Metals of high reactivity. Different techniques\nare to be used for obtaining the metals falling in each category.K\nNa\nCa\nMg\nAl\nZn\nFe\nPb\nCu\nAg\nAuReduction using\ncarbon\nFound in native\nstateElectrolysis\nFigure 3.9Figure 3.9Figure 3.9Figure 3.9Figure 3.9\nActivity series and\nrelated metallurgy\nFigure 3.10Figure 3.10Figure 3.10Figure 3.10Figure 3.10  Steps involved in the extraction of metals from ores\n3.4.2 Enrichment of Ores\nOres mined from the earth are usually contaminated with large amounts\nof impurities such as soil, sand, etc., called gangue. The impurities must\nbe removed from the ore prior to the extraction of the metal. The processesSeveral steps are involved in the extraction of pure metal from\nores. A summary of these steps is given in Fig.3.10. Each step is\nexplained in detail in the following sections.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nMetals and Non-metals 51used for removing the gangue from the ore are based on the differences\nbetween the physical or chemical properties of the gangue and the ore.\nDifferent separation techniques are  accordingly employed.\n3.4.3 Extracting Metals Low in the Activity Series\nMetals low in the activity series are very unreactive. The oxides of these\nmetals can be  reduced to metals by heating alone. For example, cinnabar\n(HgS) is an ore of mer cury. When it is heated in air , it is first converted\ninto mercuric oxide (HgO). Mercuric oxide is then reduced to mercury\non further heating.\n2HgS(s) + 3O (g) 2HgO(s) + 2SO (g)2 2Heat →  \n2HgO(s) 2Hg(l) + O (g)2Heat →  \nSimilarly, copper which is found as Cu2S in nature can be obtained\nfrom its or e by just heating in air .\n2Cu S + 3O (g) 2Cu O(s) + 2SO (g)\n2Cu O + Cu S 2 2 2 2\n2 2Heat\nHeat →  \n →    6Cu(s) + SO (g)2\n3.4.4 Extracting Metals in the Middle of the Activity Series\nThe metals in the middle of the activity series such as iron, zinc, lead,\ncopper , are moderately r eactive. These ar e usually pr esent as sulphides\nor carbonates in nature. It is easier to obtain a metal from its oxide, as\ncompared to its sulphides and carbonates. Therefore, prior to reduction,\nthe metal sulphides and carbonates must be converted into metal\noxides. The sulphide ores are converted into oxides by heating strongly\nin the pr esence of excess air . This pr ocess is known as r oasting. The\ncarbonate ores are changed into oxides by heating strongly in limited\nair. This pr ocess is known as calcination. The chemical r eaction that\ntakes place during roasting and calcination of zinc ores can be shown\nas follows –\nRoasting\n2ZnS(s) + 3O (g) 2ZnO(s) + 2SO (g)2 2Heat → \nCalcination\nZnCO (s) ZnO(s) + CO (g)3 2Heat →  \nThe metal oxides are then reduced to the corresponding metals by\nusing suitable reducing agents such as carbon. For example, when zinc\noxide is heated with carbon, it is reduced to metallic zinc.\nZnO(s) + C(s) → Zn(s) + CO(g)\nYou ar e already familiar with the pr ocess of oxidation and r eduction\nexplained in the first Chapter . Obtaining metals fr om their compounds\nis also a reduction process.\nBesides using carbon (coke) to reduce metal oxides to metals,\nsometimes displacement reactions can also be used. The highly reactive\nmetals such as sodium, calcium, aluminium, etc., are used as reducing\nReprint 2025-26\n\nScience 52agents because they can displace metals of lower reactivity from their\ncompounds. For example, when manganese dioxide is heated with\naluminium powder , the following reaction takes place –\n3MnO2(s) + 4Al(s) → 3Mn(l) + 2Al2O3(s) + Heat\nCan you identify the substances that are getting oxidised\nand reduced?\nThese displacement reactions are highly exothermic. The\namount of heat evolved is so large that the metals are produced\nin the molten state. In fact, the reaction of iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3)\nwith aluminium is used to join railway tracks or cracked\nmachine parts. This reaction is known as the thermit reaction.\nFe2O3(s) + 2Al(s) → 2Fe(l) + Al2O3(s) + Heat\n3.4.5 Extracting Metals towards the T op of the\nActivity Series\nThe metals high up in the reactivity series are very reactive. They cannot\nbe obtained from their compounds by heating with carbon. For example,\ncarbon cannot reduce the oxides of sodium, magnesium, calcium,\naluminium, etc., to the respective metals. This is because these metals\nhave more affinity for oxygen than carbon. These metals are obtained\nby electrolytic reduction. For example, sodium, magnesium and calcium\nare obtained by the electrolysis of their molten chlorides. The metals\nare deposited at the cathode (the negatively charged electrode), whereas,\nchlorine is liberated at the anode (the positively charged electrode). The\nreactions are –\nAt cathode Na+ + e–→Na\nAt anode       2Cl –→Cl2 + 2e–\nSimilarly, aluminium is obtained by the electrolytic reduction of\naluminium oxide.\n3.4.6 Refining of Metals\nThe metals produced by various reduction processes\ndescribed above are not very pure. They contain\nimpurities, which must be removed to obtain pure metals.\nThe most widely used method for refining impure metals\nis electrolytic refining.\nElectrolytic Refining: Electrolytic Refining: Electrolytic Refining: Electrolytic Refining: Electrolytic Refining: Many metals, such as copper , zinc,\ntin, nickel, silver , gold, etc., ar e refined electr olytically. In\nthis process, the impure metal is made the anode and a\nthin strip of pure metal is made the cathode. A solution of\nthe metal salt is used as an electrolyte. The apparatus is\nset up as shown in Fig. 3.12. On passing the current\nthrough the electrolyte, the pure metal from the anode\ndissolves into the electrolyte. An equivalent amount of pure\nFigure 3.11Figure 3.11Figure 3.11Figure 3.11Figure 3.11\nThermit process for\njoining railway tracks\nFigure 3.12Figure 3.12Figure 3.12Figure 3.12Figure 3.12\nElectr olytic r efining of copper .

The soluble\nimpurities go into the solution, whereas, the insoluble impurities settle\ndown at the bottom of the anode and are known as anode mud.\n1.

It is, therefore, not suitable for making\njewellery. It is alloyed with either silver or copper to make it hard. Generally, in India,\n22 carat gold is used for making ornaments. It means that 22 parts of pure gold is\nalloyed with 2 parts of either copper or silver .\nIf one of the metals is mercury, then the alloy is known as an\namalgam. The electrical conductivity and melting point of an alloy is\nless than that of pure metals. For example, brass, an alloy of copper and\nzinc (Cu and Zn), and bronze, an alloy of copper and tin (Cu and Sn), are\nnot good conductors of electricity whereas copper is used for making\nelectrical cir cuits. Solder , an alloy of lead and tin (Pb and Sn), has a low\nmelting point and is used for welding electrical wir es together .\n3.5.1 Prevention of Corrosion\nThe rusting of iron can be prevented by painting, oiling, greasing,\ngalvanising, chrome plating, anodising or making alloys.\nGalvanisation is a method of protecting steel and iron from rusting\nby coating them with a thin layer of zinc. The galvanised article is\nprotected against rusting even if the zinc coating is broken. Can you\nreason this out?\nAlloying is a very good method of improving the properties of a metal.\nWe can get the desir ed pr operties by this method. For example, iron is\nthe most widely used metal. But it is never used in its pure state. This is\nbecause pure iron is very soft and stretches easily when hot. But, if it is\nmixed with a small amount of carbon (about 0.05 %), it becomes hard\nand strong. When iron is mixed with nickel and chromium, we get\nstainless steel, which is hard and does not rust. Thus, if iron is mixed\nwith some other substance, its properties change. In fact, the properties\nof any metal can be changed if it is mixed with some other substance.\nThe substance added may be a metal or a non-metal. An alloy is a\nhomogeneous mixture of two or more metals, or a metal and a non-\nmetal. It is prepared by first melting the primary metal, and then,\ndissolving the other elements in it in definite proportions. It is then cooled\nto room temperature.\nIron pillar at DelhiThe wonder of ancient Indian metallurgy\nThe iron pillar near the Qutub Minar in Delhi was built more\nthan 1600 years ago by the iron workers of India.  They had\ndeveloped a process which prevented iron from rusting. For\nits quality of rust resistance it has been examined by scientists\nfrom all parts of the world. The iron pillar is 8 m high and\nweighs 6 tonnes (6000 kg).More to Know!\nReprint 2025-26\n\nMetals and Non-metals 55In which cases will you find displacement reactions taking place?\n2.
