(1)\nStep 3  The shaded region OPQRST  is the feasible region for the constraints (1)\n(Fig A.2.3). The co-ordinates of vertices O, P , Q, R, S and T are (0, 0), (20000, 0),\n(20000, 6000), (10500, 34500), (5000, 40000) and (0, 40000), respectively .\nReprint 2025-26\n\nMATHEMATICAL MODELLING         203\nFig A.2.3\nNote that\nZ at P (0, 0) = 0\nZ at P (20000, 0) = 8 × 20000 = 160000\nZ at Q (20000, 6000)  = 8 × 20000 + 7 × 6000 = 202000\nZ at R (10500, 34500)  = 8 × 10500 + 7 × 34500 = 325500\nZ at S = (5000, 40000) = 8 × 5000 + 7 × 40000 = 320000\nZ at T = (0, 40000)  = 7 × 40000 = 280000\nNow observe that the profit is maximum at x = 10500 and y = 34500 and the\nmaximum profit is ` 325500. Hence, the manufacturer should produce 10500 bottles of\nM1 medicine and 34500 bottles of M2 medicine in order to get maximum profit of\n` 325500.\nExample 6 Suppose a company plans to produce a new product that incur some costs\n(fixed and variable) and let the company plans to sell the product at a fixed price.\nPrepare a mathematical model to examine the profitability .\nSolution S tep 1  Situation is clearly identifiable.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n204 MATHEMA TICS\nStep 2 Formulation:  We are given that the costs are of two types: fixed and variable.\nThe fixed costs are independent of the number of units produced (e.g., rent and rates),\nwhile the variable costs increase with the number of units produced (e.g., material).\nInitially , we assume that the variable costs are directly proportional to the number of\nunits produced — this should simplify our model. The company earn a certain amount\nof money by selling its products and wants to ensure that it is maximum. For convenience,\nwe assume that all units produced are sold immediately .\nThe mathematical model\nLet x =number of units produced and sold\nC =total cost of production (in rupees)\nI =income from sales (in rupees)\nP =profit (in rupees)\nOur assumptions above state that C consists of two parts:\n(i)fixed cost =  a (in rupees),\n(ii) variable cost =  b (rupees/unit produced).\nThen C =a + bx ... (1)\nAlso, income I depends on selling price s (rupees/unit)\nThus I =sx ... (2)\nThe profit P is then the difference between income and costs. So\nP =I – C\n=sx – (a + bx)\n=(s – \nb) x – a ... (3)\nWe now have a mathematical model of the r elationships (1)  to  (3)  between\nthe variables x, C, I, P, a, b, s. These variables may be classified as:\nindependent x\ndependent C, I, P\nparameters a, b, s\nThe manufacturer , knowing x, a, b, s can determine P .\nStep 3  From (3), we can observe that for the break even point (i.e., make neither profit\nnor loss), he must have P = 0, i.e., units.axs b=−\nSteps 4 and 5  In view of the break even point, one may conclude that if the company\nproduces few units, i.e., less than unitsaxs b=−,  then the company will suffer loss\nReprint 2025-26\n\nMATHEMATICAL MODELLING         205\nand if it produces large number of units, i.e., much more than unitsa\ns b−, then it can\nmake huge profit. Further , if the break even point proves to be unrealistic, then another\nmodel could be tried or the assumptions regarding cash flow may be modified.\nRemark  From (3), we also have\nPds bd x= −\nThis means that rate of change of P with respect to x depends on the quantity\ns – b, which is the difference of selling price and the variable cost of each product.\nThus, in order to gain profit, this should be positive and to get large gains, we need to\nproduce large quantity of the product and at the same time try to reduce the variable\ncost.\nExample 7 Let a tank contains 1000 litres of brine which contains 250 g of salt per\nlitre. Brine containing 200 g of salt per litre flows into the tank at the rate of 25 litres per\nminute and the mixture flows out at the same rate. Assume that the mixture is kept\nuniform all the time by stirring. What would be the amount of salt in the tank at\nany time t?\nSolution S tep 1  The situation is easily identifiable.\nStep 2  Let y = y (t) denote the amount of salt (in kg) in the tank at time t (in minutes)\nafter the inflow , outflow starts. Further assume that y is a dif ferentiable function.\nWhen t = 0, i.e., before the inflow–outflow of the brine starts,\n y = 250 g × 1000 = 250 kg\nNote that the change in y occurs due to the inflow , outflow of the mixture.\nNow the inflow of brine brings salt into the tank at the rate of 5 kg per minute\n(as 25 × 200 g = 5 kg) and the outflow of brine takes salt out of the tank at the rate of\n251000 40y y\n\n=  kg per minute (as at time t, the salt in the tank is 1000ykg).\nThus, the rate of change of salt with respect to t is given by\ndy\ndt = 540y− (Why?)\nor1\n40dyydt+  = 5 ... (1)\nReprint 2025-26\n\n206 MATHEMA TICS\nThis gives a mathematical model for the given problem.\nStep 3  Equation (1) is a linear equation and can be easily solved. The solution of (1) is\ngiven by\n40 40200 Ct t\ny e e= +  or y (t) = 200 + C 40t\ne−\n... (2)\nwhere, c is the constant of integration.\nNote that when t = 0, y = 250. Therefore, 250 = 200 + C\nor C = 50\nThen (2) reduces to\ny = 200 + 50 40t\ne−\n... (3)\nor200\n50y− = 40t\ne−\nor40t\ne = 50\n200y−\nTherefore t = 4050\n200logey−\n\n... (4)\nHere, the equation (4) gives the time t at which the salt in tank is y kg.\nStep 4  Since 40t\ne− is always positive, from (3), we conclude that y > 200 at all times\nThus, the minimum amount of salt content in the tank is 200 kg.\nAlso, from (4), we conclude that t > 0 if and only if 0 < y  – 200 < 50 i.e., if and only\nif 200 < y  < 250 i.e., the amount of salt content in the tank after the start of inflow and\noutflow of the brine is between 200 kg and 250 kg.\nLimitations of Mathematical Modelling\nTill today many mathematical models have been developed and applied successfully\nto understand and get an insight into thousands of situations. Some of the subjects like\nmathematical physics, mathematical economics, operations research, bio-mathematics\netc. are almost synonymous with mathematical modelling.\nBut there are still a large number of situations which are yet to be modelled. The\nreason behind this is that either the situation are found to be very complex or the\nmathematical models formed are mathematically intractable.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nMATHEMATICAL MODELLING         207\nThe development of  the powerful computers and super computers has enabled us\nto mathematically model a large number of situations (even complex situations). Due\nto these fast and advanced computers, it has been possible to prepare more realistic\nmodels which can obtain better agreements with observations.\nHowever , we do not have good guidelines for choosing various parameters / variables\nand also for estimating the values of these parameters / variables used in a mathematical\nmodel. Infact, we can prepare reasonably accurate models to fit any data by choosing\nfive or six parameters / variables. We require a minimal number of parameters / variables\nto be able to estimate them accurately .\nMathematical modelling of large or complex situations has its own special problems.\nThese type of situations usually occur in the study of world models of environment,\noceanography , pollution control etc. Mathematical modellers from all disciplines —\nmathematics, computer science, physics, engineering, social sciences, etc., are involved\nin meeting these challenges with courage.\n—v vv vv—\nReprint 2025-26\n\n",
