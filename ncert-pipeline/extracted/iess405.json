Elections and institutions\nneed to be combined with a third element – enjoyment of rights – to make\na government democratic. Even the most properly elected rulers working\nthrough the established institutional process must learn not to cross some\nlimits. Citizens’ democratic rights set those limits in a democracy.\nThis is what we take up in this final chapter of the book. We begin by\ndiscussing some real life cases to imagine what it means to live without\nrights. This leads to a discussion on what we mean by rights and why do\nwe need them. As in the previous chapters, the general discussion is\nfollowed by a focus on India. We discuss one by one the Fundamental\nRights in the Indian Constitution. Then we turn to how these rights can\nbe used by ordinary citizens. Who will protect and enforce them? Finally\nwe take a look at how the scope of rights has been expanding.",

The American\ngovernment said that they were\nenemies of the US and linked to the\nattack on New York on 11\nSeptember 2001. In most cases the\ngovernments of their countries were\nnot asked or even informed about\ntheir imprisonment. Like other\nprisoners, El-Banna’s family got to\nknow that he was in that prison only\nthrough the media. Families of\nprisoners, media or even UN\nrepresentatives were not allowed to\nmeet them. The US army arrested\nthem, interrogated them and\ndecided whether to keep them there\nor not. There was no trial before any\nmagistrate in the US. Nor could\nthese prisoners approach courts in\ntheir own country.\nAmnesty International , an\ninternational human rights\norganisation, collected information\non the condition of the prisoners in\nGuantanamo Bay and reported that\nthe prisoners were being tortured in\nways that violated the US laws. TheyIn this book we have mentioned\nrights again and again. If you\nremember, we have discussed rights\nin each of the four preceding\nchapters. Can you fill in the blanks\nby recalling the rights dimension in\neach chapter?\nChapter 1: A comprehensive\ndefinition of democracy includes …\nChapter 2: Our Constitution makers\nbelieved that fundamental rights\nDEMOCRA TIC RIGHTS\nReprint 2025-26\n\n76 DEMOCRA TIC POLITICS\nwere being denied the treatment\nthat even prisoners of war must get\nas per international treaties. Many\nprisoners had tried protesting against\nthese conditions by going on a hunger\nstrike. Prisoners were not released\neven after they were officially declared\nnot guilty. An independent inquiry\nby the UN supported these findings.\nThe UN Secretary General said the\nprison in Guantanamo Bay should be\nclosed down. The US government\nrefused to accept these pleas.\nC CC CCitiz itizitiz itizitizens ensens ensens’ ’’ ’’ R  R R  R Righ ighigh ighights in ts ints in ts ints inS SS SSaudi A audi Aaudi A audi Aaudi A r rr rrabia abiaabia abiaabia\nThe case of Guantanamo Bay looks\nlike an exception, for it involves the\ngovernment of one country denying\nrights to citizens of another country.\nLet us therefore look at the case of\nSaudi Arabia and the position of the\ncitizens with regard to their\ngovernment. Consider these facts:\n/UIstopThe country is ruled by a\nhereditary king and the people\nhave no role in electing or\nchanging their rulers.\n/UIstopThe king selects the legislature as\nwell as the executive. He appoints\nthe judges and can change any of\ntheir decisions.\n/UIstopCitizens cannot form political par-\nties or any political organisations.\nMedia cannot report anything that\nthe monarch does not like.\n/UIstopThere is no freedom of religion.\nEvery citizen is required to be\nMuslim. Non-Muslim residents\ncan follow their religion in private,\nbut not in public.\n/UIstopWomen are subjected to many\npublic restrictions. The testimony\nof one man is considered equal to\nthat of two women.\nThis is true not just of Saudi\nArabia. There are many countries in\nthe world where several of these\nconditions exist.E EE EEthnic massacrthnic massacrthnic massacrthnic massacrthnic massacr e in K e in Ke in K e in Ke in K oso osooso osoosov vv vvo oo oo\nYou might think that this is possible\nin an absolute monarchy but not\nin countries which choose their\nrulers . Just consider this story from\nKosovo. This was a province of\nYugoslavia before it s split. In this\nprovince the population was\noverwhelmingly ethnic Albanian.\nBut in the entire country, Serbs\nwere in majority. A narrow minded\nSerb nationalist Milosevic\n(pronounced Miloshevich) had won\nthe election. His government was\nvery hostile to the Kosovo\nAlbanians. He wanted the Serbs to\ndominate the country. Many Serb\nleaders thought that Ethnic\nminorities like Albanians should\neither leave the country or accept\nthe dominance of the Serbs.\nThis is what happened to an\nAlbanian family in a town in Kosovo\nin April 1999:\n“74-year-old Batisha Hoxha was\nsitting in her kitchen with her 77-\nyear–old husband, Izet, staying\nwarm by the stove. They had heard\nexplosions but did not realise that\nSerbian troops had already entered\nthe town. The next thing she knew,\nfive or six soldiers had burst through\nthe front door and were demanding\n“Where are your children?”\n“… they shot Izet three times in the\nchest” recalled Batisha. With her\nhusband dying before her, the\nsoldiers pulled the wedding ring off\nher finger and told her to get out.  “I\nwas not even outside the gate when they\nburned the house ” … She was standing\non the street in the rain with no\nhouse, no husband, no possessions\nbut the clothes she was wearing.”\nThis news report was typical of\nwhat happened to thousands of\nAlbanians in that period. DoIf you were a Serb,\nwould you support\nwhat Milosevic did\nin Kosovo? Do you\nthink his project of\nestablishing Serb\ndominance was\ngood for the\nSerbs?\nReprint 2025-26\n\n77\nremember that this massacre was\nbeing carried out by the army of\ntheir own country, working under\nthe direction of a leader who came\nto power through democratic\nelections. This was one of the worst\ninstances of killings based on ethnic\nprejudices in recent times. Finally\nseveral other countries intervened\nto stop this massacre. Milosevic lost\npower and was tried by the\nInternational Court of Justice for\ncrimes against humanity.\nFor each of the three cases of life without rights, mention an example from India. These could include the\nfollowing:\n<Newspaper repor ts on custodial violence.\n<Newspaper repor ts on force-feeding of prisoners who go on hunger strike.\n<Ethnic massacre in any par t of our countr y.\n<Reports regarding unequal treatment of women.\nList the similarities  and differences  between the earlier case and the Indian example. It is not necessary\nthat for each of these cases you must find an exact Indian parallel.\nDEMOCRA TIC RIGHTSACTIVITY\n<Write a letter to Anas Jamil in UK, describing\nyour reactions af ter reading his letter to T ony\nBlair.\n<Write a letter from Batisha in K osovo to a\nwoman who faced a similar situation in\nIndia.\n<Write a memorandum on behalf of women in\nSaudi Arabia to the Secretar y General of the\nUnited Nations.\nThink of all the examples that we\nhave discussed so far. Think of the\nvictims in each example: the\nprisoners in Guantanamo Bay,\nwomen in Saudi Arabia, Albanians\nin Kosovo. If you were in their\nposition, what would you have\nwished? If you could, what would\nyou do to ensure that such things\ndo not happen to anyone?\nYou would perhaps desire a\nsystem where security, dignity and\nfair play are assured to everyone.\nYou might want, for example, that\nno one should be arrested without\nproper reason and information. And\nif someone is arrested, he or she\nshould have a fair chance to defend\nthemselves. You might agree that\nsuch assurance cannot apply toeverything. One has to be reasonable\nin what one expects and demands of\neveryone else, for one has to grant\nthe same to everyone.  But you might\ninsist that the assurance does not\nremain on paper, that there is\nsomeone to enforce these\nassurances, that those who violate\nthese are punished. In other words,\nyou might want a system where at\nleast a minimum is guaranteed to\neveryone – powerful or weak, rich\nor poor, majority or minority. This\nis the spirit behind thinking about\nrights.\nWhat are rights?What are rights?What are rights?What are rights?What are rights?\nRights are claims  of a person over\nother fellow beings, over the society\nand over the government. All of us5.2 R IGHTS  IN A DEMOCRACY\nCHECK\nYOUR\nPROGRESS\nReprint 2025-26\n\n78 DEMOCRA TIC POLITICS\nwant to live happily, without fear\nand without being subjected to\ndegraded treatment. For this we\nexpect others to behave in such a\nway that does not harm us or hurt\nus. Equally, our actions should not\nalso harm or hurt others. So a right\nis possible when you make a claim\nthat is equally possible for others.\nYou cannot have a right that harms\nor hurts others. You cannot have a\nright to play a game in such a way\nthat it breaks the neighbour’s\nwindow. The Serbs in Yugoslavia\ncould not have claimed the whole\ncountry for themselves. The claims\nwe make should be reasonable.\nThey should be such that can be\nmade available to others in an equal\nmeasure. Thus, a right comes with\nan obligation to respect other rights.\nJust because we claim some thing\nit does not become our right. It has\nto be recognised by the society we\nlive in. Rights acquire meaning only\nin society. Every society makes\ncertain rules to regulate our\nconduct. They tell us what is right\nand what is wrong. What is\nrecognised by the society as rightful\nbecomes the basis of rights. That is\nwhy the notion of rights changes\nfrom time to time and society to\nsociety. Two hundred years ago\nanyone who said that women should\nhave right to vote would have\nsounded strange. Today not granting\nthem vote in Saudi Arabia appears\nstrange.\nWhen the socially recognised\nclaims are written into law they\nacquire real force. Otherwise they\nremain merely as natural or moral\nrights. The prisoners in\nGuantanamo Bay had a moral claim\nnot to be tortured or humiliated. But\nthey could not go to anyone to\nenforce this claim. When law\nrecognises some claims they becomeenforceable. We can then demand\ntheir application. When fellow\ncitizens or the government do not\nrespect these rights we call it\nviolation or infringement of our\nrights. In such circumstances\ncitizens can approach courts to\nprotect their rights. So, if we want\nto call any claim a right, it has to\nhave these three qualities. Rights\nare reasonable claims of persons\nrecognised by society and\nsanctioned by law.\nW WW WWh hh hhy do w y do wy do w y do wy do w e nee e neee nee e neee nee d r d rd r d rd righ ighigh ighights in a ts in ats in a ts in ats in ademocr democrdemocr democrdemocr ac acac acacy? y?y? y?y?\nRights are necessary for the very\nsustenance of a democracy. In a\ndemocracy every citizen has to have\nthe right to vote and the right to\nbe elected to government. For\ndemocratic elections to take place,  it\nis necessary that citizens should\nhave the right to express their\nopinion, form political parties and\ntake part in political activities.\nRights also perform a very special\nrole in a democracy. Rights protect\nminorities from the oppression of\nmajority. They ensure that the\nmajority cannot do whatever it likes.\nRights are guarantees which can be\nused when things go wrong. Things\nmay go wrong when some citizens\nmay wish to take away the rights of\nothers. This usually happens when\nthose in majority want to dominate\nthose in minority. The government\nshould protect the citizens’ rights in\nsuch a situation. But sometimes\nelected governments may not\nprotect or may even attack the rights\nof their own citizens. That is why\nsome rights need to be placed higher\nthan the government, so that the\ngovernment cannot violate them. In\nmost democracies the basic rights\nof the citizen are written down in the\nconstitution.What are the\nexamples of\nelected\ngovernments not\nprotecting or even\nattacking the rights\nof their own\ncitizens? Why do\nthey do that?\nReprint 2025-26\n\n79/octasterisk45.3RIGHTS  IN THE INDIAN  CONSTITUTION\nR RR RRigh ighigh ighight t t tt t t tt to E o Eo E o Eo E qualit qualitqualit qualitqualit y yy yy\nThe Constitution says that the\ngovernment shall not deny to any\nperson in India equality before the law\nor the equal protection of the laws. It\nmeans that the laws apply in the same\nmanner to all, regardless of a person’s\nstatus. This is called the rule of law.\nRule of law is the foundation of any\ndemocracy. It means that no person\nis above the law. There cannot be any\ndistinction between a political leader,\ngovernment official and an ordinary\ncitizen.\nEvery citizen, from the Prime\nMinister to a small farmer in a remote\nvillage, is subjected to the same laws.\nNo person can legally claim any\nspecial treatment or privilege just\nbecause he or she happens to be an\nimportant person. For example, a few\nyears ago a former Prime Minister of\nthe country faced a court case on\ncharges of cheating. The court finally\ndeclared that he was not guilty. But\nas long as the case continued, he had\nto go to the court, give evidence and\nfile papers, just like any other citizen.\nThis basic position is further\nclarified in the Constitution by\nspelling out some implications of the\nRight to Equality. The government\nshall not discriminate against any\ncitizen on grounds only of religion,\nrace, caste, sex or place of birth. Every\ncitizen shall have access to public\nplaces like shops, restaurants, hotels,\nand cinema halls. Similarly, there\nshall be no restriction with regard to\nthe use of wells, tanks, bathing ghats,\nroads, playgrounds and places of\npublic resorts maintained by\ngovernment or dedicated to the use\nof general public. This might appear\nvery obvious, but it was necessary  to\nDEMOCRA TIC RIGHTSIn India, like most other\ndemocracies in the world, these\nrights are mentioned in the\nConstitution. Some rights which are\nfundamental to our life are given a\nspecial status. They are called\nFundamental Rights. We have\nalready read in Chapter 2 the\npreamble to our Constitution. It\ntalks about securing for all its\ncitizens equality, liberty and justice.\nFundamental Rights put this\npromise into effect. They are an\nimportant basic feature of India’s\nConstitution.\nYou already know our Constitution\nprovides for six Fundamental Rights.\nCan you recall these? What exactly\ndo these rights mean for an ordinary\ncitizen? Let us look at these one by\none.\nEveryone knows\nthat the rich can\nhave better lawyers\nin the courts.

All citizens have equality\nof opportunity in matters relating to\nemployment or appointment to any\nposition in the government. No\ncitizen shall be discriminated\nagainst or made ineligible for\nemployment on the grounds\nmentioned above. You have read in\nChapter 4 that the Government of\nIndia has provided reservations for\nScheduled Castes, Scheduled\nTribes and Other Backward Classes.\nVarious governments have different\nschemes for giving preference to\nwomen, poor or physically\nhandicapped in some kinds of jobs.\nAre these reservations against the\nright to equality? They are not. For\nequality does not mean giving\neveryone the same treatment, no\nmatter what they need. Equality\nmeans giving everyone an equal\nopportunity to achieve whatever one\nis capable of. Sometimes it is\nnecessary to give special treatment\nto someone in order to ensure equal\nopportunity. This is what job\nreservations do. Just to clarify this,\nthe Constitution says that\nreservations of this kind are not a\nviolation of the Right to Equality.\nThe principle of non-discrimination\nextends to social life as well. The\nConstitution mentions one extreme\nform of social discrimination, the\npractice of  untouchability, and\nclearly directs the government to put\nan end to it. The practice of\nuntouchability has been forbidden\nin any form. Untouchability here\ndoes not only mean refusal to touch\npeople belonging to certain castes.\nIt refers to any belief or social\nACTIVITY\n/UIstopGo to the playground of the school or any sta-\ndium and watch a 400 metre race on any track.\nWhy are the competitors in the outer lane placed\nahead of those in the inner lane at the star ting\npoint of the race?

Your freedoms should not\ncause public nuisance or disorder.\nYou are free to do everything which\ninjures no one else. Freedom is not\nunlimited licence to do what one\nwants. Accordingly, the government\ncan impose certain reasonable\nrestrictions on our freedoms in the\nlarger interests of the society.\nFreedom of speech and\nexpression  is one of the essential\nfeatures of any democracy.

But such meetings have to\nbe peaceful. They should not lead\nto public disorder or breach of peace\nin society. Those who participate in\nthese activities and meetings should\nnot carry weapons with them.\nCitizens also can form associations.\nFor example workers in a factory can\nform a workers’ union to promote\ntheir interests. Some people in a\ntown may come together to form an\nassociation to campaign against\ncorruption or pollution.\nAs citizens we have the freedom to\ntravel to any part of the country .\nWe are free to reside and settle in any\npart of the territory of India.

This right allows lakhs of\npeople to migrate from villages to\ntowns and from poorer regions of the\ncountries to prosperous regions and\nbig cities. The same freedom extends\nto choice of occupations. No one can\nforce you to do or not to do a certain\njob. Women cannot be told that some\nkinds of occupations are not for them.\nPeople from deprived castes cannot\nbe kept to their traditional\noccupations.\nThe Constitution says that no\nperson can be deprived of his life or\npersonal liberty  except  according toprocedure established by law. It\nmeans that no person can be killed\nunless the court has ordered a death\nsentence. It also means that a\ngovernment or police officer cannot\narrest or detain any citizen unless\nhe has proper legal justification.\nEven when they do, they have to\nfollow some procedures:\n/UIstopA person who is arrested and\ndetained in custody will have to be\ninformed of the reasons for such\narrest and detention.\n/UIstopA person who is arrested and\ndetained shall be produced before\nthe nearest magistrate within a\nperiod of 24 hours of arrest.\n/UIstopSuch a person has the right to\nconsult a lawyer or engage a\nlawyer for his defence.Irfan Khan Irfan Khan\nReprint 2025-26\n\n83\nLet us recall the cases of\nGuantanamo Bay and Kosovo.

Yet the Constitution\nmakers thought is was necessary to\nwrite down certain clear provisions\nto prevent exploitation of the weaker\nsections of the society.\nThe Constitution mentions three\nspecific evils and declares these\nillegal. First, the Constitution\nprohibits ‘ traffic  in human beings’.\nTraffic here means selling and\nbuying of human beings, usually\nwomen, for immoral purposes.\nSecond, our Constitution also\nprohibits forced labour or begar  inany form. Begar  is a practice where\nthe worker is forced to render service\nto the ‘master’ free of charge or at a\nnominal remuneration. When this\npractice takes place on a life-long\nbasis, it is called the practice of\nbonded labour.\nFinally, the Constitution also\nprohibits child labour.

In this case\ntoo, the Constitution makers were\nvery particular to state it clearly. You\nhave already read in Chapter 2 that\nIndia is a secular state. Most people\nin India, like anywhere else in the\nworld, follow different religions. Some\nmay not believe in any religion.\nSecularism is based on the idea that\nthe state is concerned only with\nrelations among human beings, and\nnot with the relation between human\nbeings and God. A secular state is one\nthat does not establish any one\nreligion as official religion. Indian\nsecularism practices an attitude of a\nprincipled and equal distance from\nall religions. The state has to be\nneutral and impartial in dealing with\nall religions.\nEvery person has a right to\nprofess, practice and propagate\nthe religion  he or she believes in.\nEvery religious group or sect is free\nto manage its religious affairs. A\nright to propagate one’s religion,\nhowever, does not mean that a\nperson has right to compel another\nperson to convert into his religion by\nmeans of force, fraud, inducement or\nallurement. Of course, a person is free\nto change religion on his or her own\nwill. Freedom to practice religion\ndoes not mean that a person can do\nwhatever he wants in the name ofreligion. For example, one cannot\nsacrifice animals or human beings\nas offerings to supernatural forces\nor gods. Religious practices which\ntreat women as inferior or those that\ninfringe women’s freedom are not\nallowed. For example, one cannot\nforce a widow to shave head or wear\nwhite clothes.\nA secular state is one that does not\nconfer any privilege or favour on any\nparticular religion. Nor does it pun-\nish or discriminate against people\non the basis of religion they follow.\nThus the government cannot com-\npel any person to pay any taxes for\nthe promotion or maintenance of\nany particular religion or religious\ninstitution. There shall be no\nreligious instruction in the govern-\nment educational institutions. In\neducational institutions managed by\nprivate bodies no person shall be\ncompelled to take part in any\nreligious instruction or to attend any\nreligious worship.\nC CC CCultur ulturultur ulturultur al and E al and Eal and E al and Eal and E duca ducaduca ducaduca tional tionaltional tionaltionalR RR RRigh ighigh ighights tsts tsts\nYou might wonder why the\nConstitution makers were so\nparticular in providing written\nguarantees of the rights of the\nminorities. Why are there no special\nguarantees for the majority? Well, for\nthe simple reason that the working\nof democracy gives power  to the\nmajority. It is the language, culture\nand religion of minorities that needs\nspecial protection. Otherwise, they\nmay get neglected or undermined\nunder the impact of the language,\nreligion and culture of the majority.\nThat is why the Constitution speci-\nfies the cultural and educational\nrights of the minorities:\n/UIstopAny section of citizens with a\ndistinct language or culture have\na right to conserve it.The Constitution\ndoes not give\npeople their\nreligion.

It is possible that\nsometimes our rights may be\nviolated by fellow citizens, private\nbodies or by the government. When\nany of our rights are violated we can\nseek remedy through courts.

We can challenge such laws\nof the central and state\ngovernments, the policies and\nactions of the government or the\ngovernmental organisations like the\nnationalised banks or electricity\nboards. Courts also enforce the\nFundamental Rights against private\nindividuals and bodies.

In much\nof the chapter we have focussed only\non Fundamental Rights in the\nConstitution. You might think that\nFundamental Rights granted by the\nConstitution are the only rights\ncitizen have. This is not true. While\nFundamental Rights are the source\nof all rights, our Constitution and\nlaw offers a wider range of rights.\nOver the years the scope of rights\nhas expanded.\nSometimes it leads to expansion\nin the legal rights that the citizen can\nenjoy. From time to time, the courts\ngave judgments to expand the scope\nof rights. Certain rights like right to\nfreedom of press, right to\ninformation, and right to education\nare derived from the Fundamental\nRights. Now school education has\nbecome a right for Indian citizens.\nThe governments are responsible for\nproviding free and compulsory\neducation to all children up to the\nage of 14 years. Parliament has\nenacted a law giving the right to\ninformation to the citizens. This Act\nwas made under the Fundamental\nRight to freedom of thought and\nexpression. We have a right to seek\ninformation from government\noffices. Recently the Supreme Court\nhas expanded the meaning of the\nright to life to include the right to\nfood. Also, rights are not limited only\nto Fundamental Rights asenumerated in the Constitution.\nConstitution provides many more\nrights, which may not be Fundamental\nRights. For example the right to\nproperty is not a Fundamental Right\nbut it is a constitutional right. Right to\nvote in elections is an important\nconstitutional right.\nSometimes the expansion takes\nplace in what is called human rights.\nThese are universal moral claims that\nmay or may not have been recognised\nby law. In that sense these claims are\nnot rights going by the definition that\nwe presented earlier. With the\nexpansion of democracy all over the\nworld, there is greater pressure on\ngovernments to accept these claims.\nSome international covenants  have\nalso contributed to the expansion of\nrights.\nThus the scope of rights has been\nexpanding and new rights are\nevolving over time. They are result\nof struggle of the people. New rights\nemerge as societies develop or as\nnew constitutions are made. The\nConstitution of South Africa guarantees\nits citizens several kinds of new rights:\n<Right to privacy, so that citizens\nor their home cannot be searched,\ntheir phones cannot be tapped,\ntheir communication cannot be\nopened.\n<Right to an environment that is not\nharmful to their health or well-\nbeing;\n<Right to have access to adequate\nhousing.\nDEMOCRA TIC RIGHTS\nAre these rights\nonly for adults?\nWhich of these\nrights are available\nto children?\nReprint 2025-26\n\n88 DEMOCRA TIC POLITICS\nGLOSSAR Y\n<Right to have access to health care\nservices, sufficient food and water;\nno one may be refused emergency\nmedical treatment.Many people think that the right to\nwork, right to health, right to minimum\nlivelihood and right to privacy\nshould be made fundamental rights\nin India as well.
