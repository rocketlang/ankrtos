Rearrange them as shown in Fig 6.13 (i), (ii).\nThe three angles now constitute one angle. This angle is a straight angle and so has\nmeasure 180°.\nFig 6.13\nThus, the sum of the measures of the three angles of a triangle is 180°.\n2.The same fact you can observe in a dif ferent way also.

The line XM through X is now the axis of symmetry (which\nyou will read in Chapter 14). You find that  ∠Y and  ∠Z fit on each other exactly . XY and\nXZ are called equal sides;  YZ is called the base; ∠Y and  ∠Z are called base angles and\nthese are also equal.\nThus, in an isosceles triangle:\n(i)two sides have same length.\n(ii)base angles opposite to the equal sides are equal.\n1.Find angle x in each figure:TRY THESE\n2024-25\n\nTHE TRIANGLE AND ITS PROPERTIES 99\n2.Find angles x and y in each figure.\n6.7  SUM OF THE LENGTHS  OF TWO SIDES OF A TRIANGLE\n1.

She can, for example, walk first along AB and then\nalong BC to reach C; or she can walk straight along AC. She will\nnaturally prefer the direct path AC. If she takes the other path  ( ABand\nthen BC), she will have to walk more. In other words,\nAB + BC > AC (i)\nSimilarly , if one were to start from B and go to A, he or she will not take the route\nBC and CA but will prefer BA This is because\nBC + CA > AB (ii)\nBy a similar argument, you find that\nCA + AB > BC (iii)\nThese observations suggest that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a\ntriangle is greater than the third side .\n",

Mark three non-collinear spots A, B and C in your playground. Using lime powder\nmark the paths AB, BC and AC.\nAsk your friend to start from A and reach C, walking along one or more\nof these paths. She can, for example, walk first along AB and then\nalong BC to reach C; or she can walk straight along AC. She will\nnaturally prefer the direct path AC. If she takes the other path  ( ABand\nthen BC), she will have to walk more. In other words,\nAB + BC > AC (i)\nSimilarly , if one were to start from B and go to A, he or she will not take the route\nBC and CA but will prefer BA This is because\nBC + CA > AB (ii)\nBy a similar argument, you find that\nCA + AB > BC (iii)\nThese observations suggest that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a\ntriangle is greater than the third side .\n2. Collect fifteen small sticks (or strips) of dif ferent lengths, say , 6 cm, 7 cm, 8 cm,\n9 cm, ..., 20 cm.\nTake any three of these sticks and try to form a triangle. Repeat this by choosing\ndifferent combinations of three sticks.\nSuppose you first choose two sticks of length 6 cm and 12 cm. Your third stick has to\nbe of length more than 12 – 6 = 6 cm and less than 12 + 6 = 18 cm. Try this and find\nout why it is so.\nTo form a triangle you will need any three sticks such that the sum of the lengths of\nany two of them will always be greater than the length of the third stick.\nThis also suggests that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is greater\nthan the third side.Fig 6.21\n2024-25\n\nMATHEMA TICS 100\n3.Draw any three triangles, say ∆ABC, ∆PQR and ∆XYZ in your notebook\n(Fig 6.22).\n(i) (ii) (iii)\n              Fig 6.22\nUse your ruler to find the lengths of their sides and then tabulate your results as follows:\nName of ∆∆∆\n∆∆ Lengths of Sides Is this True?\n∆ ABC AB ___ AB – BC < CA (Yes/No)\n___ + ___ > ___\nBC ___ BC –  CA   <  AB (Yes/No)\n___ + ___ > ___\nCA  ___ CA – AB < BC (Yes/No)\n___ + ___ > ___\n∆ PQR PQ ___ PQ  – QR < RP (Yes/No)\n___ + ___ > ___\nQR ___ QR –  RP < PQ (Yes/No)\n___ + ___ > ___\nRP ___ RP – PQ < QR (Yes/No)\n___ + ___ > ___\n∆ XYZ XY ___ XY – YZ < ZX (Yes/No)\n___ + ___ > ___\nYZ  ___ YZ – ZX < XY (Yes/No)\n___ + ___ > ___\nZX ___ ZX – XY  < YZ (Yes/No)\n___ + ___ > ___\nThis also strengthens our earlier guess. Therefore, we conclude that sum of the lengths\nof any two sides of a triangle is greater than the length of the third side.\nWe also find that the dif ference between the length of any two sides of a triangle is\nsmaller than the length of the third side.A\nB CR\nPQ\n2024-25\n\nTHE TRIANGLE AND ITS PROPERTIES 101\nEXAMPLE  3Is there a triangle whose sides have lengths 10.2 cm, 5.8 cm and 4.5 cm?\nSOLUTION Suppose such a triangle is possible. Then the sum of the lengths of any two\nsides would be greater than the length of the third side. Let us check this.\n                                 Is 4.5 + 5.8 > 10.2? Yes\n      Is 5.8 + 10.2 > 4.5? Yes\nIs 10.2 + 4.5 > 5.8? Yes\nTherefore, the triangle is possible.\nEXAMPLE  4The lengths of two sides of a triangle are 6 cm and 8 cm. Between which\ntwo numbers can length of the third side fall?\nSOLUTION We know that the sum of two sides of a triangle is always greater than\nthe third.\nTherefore, third side has to be less than the sum of the two sides. The third side is thus,\nless than 8 + 6 = 14 cm.\nThe side cannot be less than the difference of the two sides. Thus, the third side has to\nbe more than 8 – 6 = 2 cm.\nThe length of the third side could be any length greater than 2 and less than 14 cm.\nEXERCISE  6.4\n1.Is it possible to have a triangle with the following sides?\n(i)2 cm, 3 cm, 5 cm (ii)3 cm, 6 cm, 7 cm\n(iii) 6 cm, 3 cm, 2 cm\n2.Take any point O in the interior of a triangle PQR.

In fact, this\nproperty was known to people of many other\ncountries too. The Indian mathematician Baudhayan\nhas also given an equivalent form of this property .\nWe now try to explain the Pythagoras property .\nIn a right-angled triangle, the sides have some\nspecial names. The side opposite to the right angle\nis called the hypotenuse ; the other two sides are\nknown as the legs of the right-angled triangle.\nIn \n∆ABC (Fig 6.23), the right-angle is at B. So,\nAC is the hypotenuse. AB and BC are the legs of\n∆ABC.\nMake eight identical copies of right angled\ntriangle of any size you prefer . For example, you\nmake a right-angled triangle whose hypotenuse is a\nunits long and the legs are of lengths b\n units and\nc units (Fig 6.24).\nDraw two identical squares on a sheet with sides\nof lengths b + c.\nYou are to place four triangles in one square and the remaining four triangles in the\nother square, as shown in the following diagram (Fig 6.25).\nFig 6.23\nFig 6.24\nFig 6.25Square A Square B\n2024-25\n\nTHE TRIANGLE AND ITS PROPERTIES 103\nThe squares are identical; the eight triangles inserted are also identical.\nHence the uncovered area of square A = Uncovered area of square B.\ni.e., Area of inner square of square A = The total area of two uncovered squares in square B.\na2 =b2 + c2\nThis is Pythagoras property . It may be stated as follows:\nIn a right-angled triangle,\nthe square on the hypotenuse = sum of the squares on the legs.\nPythagoras property is a very useful tool in mathematics. It is formally proved as a\ntheorem in later classes. You should be clear about its meaning.\nIt says that for any right-angled triangle, the area of the square on the hypotenuse is\nequal to the sum of the areas of the squares on the legs.\nDraw a right triangle, preferably on\na square sheet, construct squares on\nits sides, compute the area of these\nsquares and verify the theorem\npractically (Fig 6.26).\nIf you have a right-angled triangle,\nthe Pythagoras property holds. If the\nPythagoras property holds for some\ntriangle, will the triangle be right-\nangled? (Such problems are known as\nconverse problems). We will try to\nanswer this. Now , we will show that,\nif there is a triangle such that sum of\nthe squares on two of its sides is equal\nto the square of the third side, it must\nbe a right-angled triangle.Fig 6.26\nDO THIS\n5262\n4256\n4\nFig 6.27\n1.Have cut-outs of squares with sides 4 cm,\n5 cm, 6 cm long. Arrange to get a triangular\nshape by placing the corners of the squares\nsuitably as shown in the figure (Fig 6.27).\nTrace out the triangle formed. Measure each\nangle of the triangle. You find that there is no\nright angle at all.\nIn fact, in this case each angle will be acute! Note\nthat 42 + 52 ≠ 62, 52 + 62 ≠ 42 and 62 + 42 ≠ 52.\n2024-25\n\nMATHEMA TICS 104\n2.Repeat the above activity with squares whose sides have lengths 4 cm, 5 cm and\n7 cm. You get an obtuse-angled triangle! Note that\n42 + 52 ≠72 etc.\nThis shows that Pythagoras property holds if and only if the triangle is right-angled.\nHence we get this fact:\nIf  the Pythagoras property holds, the triangle must be right-angled.\nEXAMPLE  5Determine whether the triangle whose lengths of sides are 3 cm, 4 cm,\n5 cm is a right-angled triangle.\nSOLUTION 32 = 3 × 3 = 9; 42 = 4 × 4 = 16; 52 = 5 × 5 = 25\nWe find 32 + 42 = 52.\nTherefore, the triangle is right-angled.\nNote: In any right-angled triangle, the hypotenuse happens to be the longest side. In this\nexample, the side with length 5 cm is the hypotenuse.\nEXAMPLE  6 ∆ ABC is right-angled at C. If\nAC = 5 cm and BC = 12 cm find\nthe length of AB.\nSOLUTION A rough figure will help us (Fig 6.28).\nBy Pythagoras property ,\nAB2 =AC2 + BC2\n= 52 + 122  = 25 + 144 = 169 = 132\nor AB2 =132.  So,   AB = 13\nor the length of AB is 13 cm.\nNote: To identify perfect squares, you may use prime factorisation technique.Fig 6.28\nTRY THESE\nFind the unknown length x in the following figures (Fig 6.29):\n2024-25\n\nTHE TRIANGLE AND ITS PROPERTIES 105\nEXERCISE  6.5\n1.PQR is a triangle, right-angled at P .

Mark three non-collinear spots A, B and C in your playground. Using lime powder\nmark the paths AB, BC and AC.\nAsk your friend to start from A and reach C, walking along one or more\nof these paths. She can, for example, walk first along AB and then\nalong BC to reach C; or she can walk straight along AC. She will\nnaturally prefer the direct path AC. If she takes the other path  ( ABand\nthen BC), she will have to walk more. In other words,\nAB + BC > AC (i)\nSimilarly , if one were to start from B and go to A, he or she will not take the route\nBC and CA but will prefer BA This is because\nBC + CA > AB (ii)\nBy a similar argument, you find that\nCA + AB > BC (iii)\nThese observations suggest that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a\ntriangle is greater than the third side .\n2. Collect fifteen small sticks (or strips) of dif ferent lengths, say , 6 cm, 7 cm, 8 cm,\n9 cm, ..., 20 cm.\nTake any three of these sticks and try to form a triangle. Repeat this by choosing\ndifferent combinations of three sticks.\nSuppose you first choose two sticks of length 6 cm and 12 cm. Your third stick has to\nbe of length more than 12 – 6 = 6 cm and less than 12 + 6 = 18 cm. Try this and find\nout why it is so.\nTo form a triangle you will need any three sticks such that the sum of the lengths of\nany two of them will always be greater than the length of the third stick.\nThis also suggests that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is greater\nthan the third side.Fig 6.21\n2024-25\n\nMATHEMA TICS 100\n3.Draw any three triangles, say ∆ABC, ∆PQR and ∆XYZ in your notebook\n(Fig 6.22).\n(i) (ii) (iii)\n              Fig 6.22\nUse your ruler to find the lengths of their sides and then tabulate your results as follows:\nName of ∆∆∆\n∆∆ Lengths of Sides Is this True?\n∆ ABC AB ___ AB – BC < CA (Yes/No)\n___ + ___ > ___\nBC ___ BC –  CA   <  AB (Yes/No)\n___ + ___ > ___\nCA  ___ CA – AB < BC (Yes/No)\n___ + ___ > ___\n∆ PQR PQ ___ PQ  – QR < RP (Yes/No)\n___ + ___ > ___\nQR ___ QR –  RP < PQ (Yes/No)\n___ + ___ > ___\nRP ___ RP – PQ < QR (Yes/No)\n___ + ___ > ___\n∆ XYZ XY ___ XY – YZ < ZX (Yes/No)\n___ + ___ > ___\nYZ  ___ YZ – ZX < XY (Yes/No)\n___ + ___ > ___\nZX ___ ZX – XY  < YZ (Yes/No)\n___ + ___ > ___\nThis also strengthens our earlier guess. Therefore, we conclude that sum of the lengths\nof any two sides of a triangle is greater than the length of the third side.\nWe also find that the dif ference between the length of any two sides of a triangle is\nsmaller than the length of the third side.A\nB CR\nPQ\n2024-25\n\nTHE TRIANGLE AND ITS PROPERTIES 101\nEXAMPLE  3Is there a triangle whose sides have lengths 10.2 cm, 5.8 cm and 4.5 cm?\nSOLUTION Suppose such a triangle is possible. Then the sum of the lengths of any two\nsides would be greater than the length of the third side. Let us check this.\n                                 Is 4.5 + 5.8 > 10.2? Yes\n      Is 5.8 + 10.2 > 4.5? Yes\nIs 10.2 + 4.5 > 5.8? Yes\nTherefore, the triangle is possible.\nEXAMPLE  4The lengths of two sides of a triangle are 6 cm and 8 cm. Between which\ntwo numbers can length of the third side fall?\nSOLUTION We know that the sum of two sides of a triangle is always greater than\nthe third.\nTherefore, third side has to be less than the sum of the two sides. The third side is thus,\nless than 8 + 6 = 14 cm.\nThe side cannot be less than the difference of the two sides. Thus, the third side has to\nbe more than 8 – 6 = 2 cm.\nThe length of the third side could be any length greater than 2 and less than 14 cm.\nEXERCISE  6.4\n1.Is it possible to have a triangle with the following sides?\n(i)2 cm, 3 cm, 5 cm (ii)3 cm, 6 cm, 7 cm\n(iii) 6 cm, 3 cm, 2 cm\n2.Take any point O in the interior of a triangle PQR.

In fact, this\nproperty was known to people of many other\ncountries too. The Indian mathematician Baudhayan\nhas also given an equivalent form of this property .\nWe now try to explain the Pythagoras property .\nIn a right-angled triangle, the sides have some\nspecial names. The side opposite to the right angle\nis called the hypotenuse ; the other two sides are\nknown as the legs of the right-angled triangle.\nIn \n∆ABC (Fig 6.23), the right-angle is at B. So,\nAC is the hypotenuse. AB and BC are the legs of\n∆ABC.\nMake eight identical copies of right angled\ntriangle of any size you prefer . For example, you\nmake a right-angled triangle whose hypotenuse is a\nunits long and the legs are of lengths b\n units and\nc units (Fig 6.24).\nDraw two identical squares on a sheet with sides\nof lengths b + c.\nYou are to place four triangles in one square and the remaining four triangles in the\nother square, as shown in the following diagram (Fig 6.25).\nFig 6.23\nFig 6.24\nFig 6.25Square A Square B\n2024-25\n\nTHE TRIANGLE AND ITS PROPERTIES 103\nThe squares are identical; the eight triangles inserted are also identical.\nHence the uncovered area of square A = Uncovered area of square B.\ni.e., Area of inner square of square A = The total area of two uncovered squares in square B.\na2 =b2 + c2\nThis is Pythagoras property . It may be stated as follows:\nIn a right-angled triangle,\nthe square on the hypotenuse = sum of the squares on the legs.\nPythagoras property is a very useful tool in mathematics. It is formally proved as a\ntheorem in later classes. You should be clear about its meaning.\nIt says that for any right-angled triangle, the area of the square on the hypotenuse is\nequal to the sum of the areas of the squares on the legs.\nDraw a right triangle, preferably on\na square sheet, construct squares on\nits sides, compute the area of these\nsquares and verify the theorem\npractically (Fig 6.26).\nIf you have a right-angled triangle,\nthe Pythagoras property holds. If the\nPythagoras property holds for some\ntriangle, will the triangle be right-\nangled? (Such problems are known as\nconverse problems). We will try to\nanswer this. Now , we will show that,\nif there is a triangle such that sum of\nthe squares on two of its sides is equal\nto the square of the third side, it must\nbe a right-angled triangle.Fig 6.26\nDO THIS\n5262\n4256\n4\nFig 6.27\n1.Have cut-outs of squares with sides 4 cm,\n5 cm, 6 cm long. Arrange to get a triangular\nshape by placing the corners of the squares\nsuitably as shown in the figure (Fig 6.27).\nTrace out the triangle formed. Measure each\nangle of the triangle. You find that there is no\nright angle at all.\nIn fact, in this case each angle will be acute! Note\nthat 42 + 52 ≠ 62, 52 + 62 ≠ 42 and 62 + 42 ≠ 52.\n2024-25\n\nMATHEMA TICS 104\n2.Repeat the above activity with squares whose sides have lengths 4 cm, 5 cm and\n7 cm. You get an obtuse-angled triangle! Note that\n42 + 52 ≠72 etc.\nThis shows that Pythagoras property holds if and only if the triangle is right-angled.\nHence we get this fact:\nIf  the Pythagoras property holds, the triangle must be right-angled.\nEXAMPLE  5Determine whether the triangle whose lengths of sides are 3 cm, 4 cm,\n5 cm is a right-angled triangle.\nSOLUTION 32 = 3 × 3 = 9; 42 = 4 × 4 = 16; 52 = 5 × 5 = 25\nWe find 32 + 42 = 52.\nTherefore, the triangle is right-angled.\nNote: In any right-angled triangle, the hypotenuse happens to be the longest side. In this\nexample, the side with length 5 cm is the hypotenuse.\nEXAMPLE  6 ∆ ABC is right-angled at C. If\nAC = 5 cm and BC = 12 cm find\nthe length of AB.\nSOLUTION A rough figure will help us (Fig 6.28).\nBy Pythagoras property ,\nAB2 =AC2 + BC2\n= 52 + 122  = 25 + 144 = 169 = 132\nor AB2 =132.  So,   AB = 13\nor the length of AB is 13 cm.\nNote: To identify perfect squares, you may use prime factorisation technique.Fig 6.28\nTRY THESE\nFind the unknown length x in the following figures (Fig 6.29):\n2024-25\n\nTHE TRIANGLE AND ITS PROPERTIES 105\nEXERCISE  6.5\n1.PQR is a triangle, right-angled at P .

Try to collect a few of them and draw charts explaining them.\nWHAT HAVE WE DISCUSSED ?\n1.The six elements  of a triangle are its \nthree angles  and the three sides.\n2.The line segment joining a vertex of a triangle to the mid point of its opposite side is\ncalled a median  of the triangle.   A triangle has 3 medians.\n3.The perpendicular line segment from a vertex of a triangle to its opposite side is\ncalled an altitude  of the triangle.    A triangle has 3 altitudes.\n4.An exterior  angle  of a triangle is formed, when a side of a triangle is produced.

In a right angled triangle, the side opposite to the right angle is called the hypotenuse\nand the other two sides are called its legs.\n11.Pythagoras property :\nIn a right-angled triangle,\nthe square on the hypotenuse = the sum of the squares on its legs.\nIf a triangle is not right-angled, this property does not hold good.  This property is\nuseful to decide whether a given triangle is right-angled or not.\n2024-25\n\n",
