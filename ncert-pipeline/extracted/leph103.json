      "content": "Chapter 1, all charges whether free or bound, were considered to be at\nrest. Charges in motion constitute an electric current. Such currents occur\nnaturally in many situations. Lightning is one such phenomenon in\nwhich charges flow from the clouds to the earth through the atmosphere,\nsometimes with disastrous results. The flow of charges in lightning is not\nsteady, but in our everyday life we see many devices where charges flow\nin a steady manner , like water flowing smoothly in a river . A tor ch and a\ncell-driven clock ar e examples of such devices. In the pr esent chapter , we\nshall study some of the basic laws concerning steady electric currents.\n3.2  E LECTRIC  CURRENT\nImagine a small area held normal to the direction of flow of charges. Both\nthe positive and the negative charges may flow forward and backward\nacross the area. In a given time interval t, let q+ be the net amount ( i.e.,\nforward minus backward) of positive charge that flows in the forward\ndirection across the area. Similarly, let q– be the net amount of negative\ncharge flowing across the area in the forward direction. The net amount\nof charge flowing across the area in the forward direction in the time\ninterval t, then, is q = q+– q–. This is proportional to t for steady currentChapter Three\nCURRENT\nELECTRICITY\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPhysics\n82and the quotient\nqIt= (3.1)\nis defined to be the current  across the area in the forward direction. (If it\nturn out to be a negative number , it implies a curr ent in the backwar d\ndirection.)\nCurrents are not always steady and hence more generally, we define\nthe current as follows. Let DQ be the net charge flowing across a cross-\nsection of a conductor during the time interval Dt [i.e., between times t\nand ( t + Dt)]. Then, the current at time t across the cross-section of the\nconductor is defined as the value of the ratio of DQ to Dt in the limit of Dt\ntending to zero,\n()\n0lim\ntQI tt Δ →Δ≡Δ(3.2)\nIn SI units, the unit of current is ampere. An ampere is defined\nthrough magnetic effects of currents that we will study in the following\nchapter . An amper e is typically the or der of magnitude of curr ents in\ndomestic appliances. An average lightning carries currents of the order\nof tens of thousands of amperes and at the other extreme, currents in\nour nerves are in microamperes.\n3.3 E LECTRIC  CURRENTS IN CONDUCTORS\nAn electric charge will experience a force if an electric field is applied. If it is\nfree to move, it will thus move contributing to a current. In nature, free\ncharged particles do exist like in upper strata of atmosphere called the\nionospher e. However , in atoms and molecules, the negatively char ged\nelectrons and the positively charged nuclei are bound to each other and\nare thus not free to move. Bulk matter is made up of many molecules, a\ngram of water , for example, contains appr oximately 1022 molecules. These\nmolecules are so closely packed that the electrons are no longer attached\nto individual nuclei. In some materials, the electrons will still be bound,\ni.e., they will not accelerate even if an electric field is applied. In other\nmaterials, notably metals, some of the electrons are practically free to move\nwithin the bulk material. These materials, generally called conductors,\ndevelop electric currents in them when an electric field is applied.\nIf we consider solid conductors, then of course the atoms are tightly\nbound to each other so that the current is carried by the negatively\ncharged electr ons. Ther e are, however , other types of conductors like\nelectrolytic solutions where positive and negative charges both can move.\nIn our discussions, we will focus only on solid conductors so that the\ncurrent is carried by the negatively charged electrons in the background\nof fixed positive ions.\nConsider first the case when no electric field is present. The electrons\nwill be moving due to thermal motion during which they collide with the\nfixed ions. An electron colliding with an ion emerges with the same speed\nas befor e the collision. However , the dir ection of its velocity after the\ncollision is completely random. At a given time, there is no preferential\ndirection for the velocities of the electrons. Thus on the average, the\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCurrent\nElectricity\n83number of electrons travelling in any direction will be equal to the number\nof electrons travelling in the opposite direction. So, there will be no net\nelectric current.\nLet us now see what happens to such a\npiece of conductor if an electric field is applied.\nTo focus our thoughts, imagine the conductor\nin the shape of a cylinder of radius R (Fig. 3.1).\nSuppose we now take two thin circular discs\nof a dielectric of the same radius and put\npositive charge + Q distributed over one disc\nand similarly – Q at the other disc. W e attach\nthe two discs on the two flat surfaces of the\ncylinder . An electric field will be cr eated and\nis directed from the positive towards the\nnegative charge. The electrons will be accelerated due to this field towards\n+Q. They will thus move to neutralise the charges. The electrons, as long\nas they are moving, will constitute an electric current. Hence in the\nsituation considered, there will be a current for a very short while and no\ncurrent ther eafter .\nWe can also imagine a mechanism wher e the ends of the cylinder ar e\nsupplied with fresh charges to make up for any charges neutralised by\nelectr ons moving inside the conductor . In that case, ther e will be a steady\nelectric field in the body of the conductor . This will r esult in a continuous\ncurrent rather than a current for a short period of time. Mechanisms,\nwhich maintain a steady electric field are cells or batteries that we shall\nstudy  later in this chapter . In the next sections, we shall study the steady\ncurrent that results from a steady electric field in conductors.\n3.4  O HM’S LAW\nA basic law regarding flow of currents was discovered by G.S. Ohm in\n1828, long before the physical mechanism responsible for flow of currents\nwas discovered. Imagine a conductor through which a current I is flowing\nand let V be the potential dif ference between the ends of the conductor .\nThen Ohm’s law states that\n     V µ I\nor, V = R I (3.3)\nwhere the constant of proportionality R is called the resistance  of the\nconductor . The SI units of r esistance is ohm, and is denoted by the symbol\nW. The r esistance R not only depends on the material of the conductor\nbut also on the dimensions of the conductor . The dependence of R on the\ndimensions of the conductor can easily be determined as follows.\nConsider a conductor satisfying Eq. (3.3) to be in the form of a slab of\nlength l and cross sectional area A [Fig. 3.2(a)]. Imagine placing two such\nidentical slabs side by side [Fig. 3.2(b)], so that the length of the\ncombination is 2 l. The current flowing through the  combination is the\nsame as that flowing through either of the slabs. If V is the potential\ndifference across the ends of the first slab, then V is also the potential\ndifference across the ends of the second slab since the second slab isFIGURE  3.1 Charges + Q and – Q put at the ends\nof a metallic cylinder . The electr ons will drift\nbecause of the electric field created to\nneutralise the charges. The current thus\nwill stop after a while unless the charges + Q\nand – Q are continuously replenished.\nFIGURE  3.2\nIllustrating the\nrelation R = rl/A for\na rectangular slab\nof length l and area\nof cross-section A.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPhysics\n84identical to the first and the same current I flows through\nboth. The potential difference across the ends of the\ncombination is clearly sum of the potential difference\nacross the two individual slabs and hence equals 2 V. The\ncurrent through the combination is I and the resistance\nof the combination RC is [from Eq. (3.3)],\n22CVR RI= = (3.4)\nsince V/I = R , the resistance of either of the slabs. Thus,\ndoubling the length of a conductor doubles the\nresistance. In general, then resistance is proportional to\nlength,\nR l∝ (3.5)\nNext, imagine dividing the slab into two by cutting it\nlengthwise so that the slab can be considered as a\ncombination of two identical slabs of length l, but each\nhaving a cross sectional  area of A/2 [Fig. 3.2(c)].\nFor a given voltage V across the slab, if I  is the current\nthrough the entire slab, then clearly the current flowing\nthrough each of the two half-slabs is I/2. Since the\npotential difference across the ends of the half-slabs is V,\ni.e., the same as across the full slab, the resistance of each\nof the half-slabs R1 is\n1 2 2 .( /2)V VR RI I= = = (3.6)\nThus, halving the area of the cross-section of a conductor doubles\nthe resistance. In general, then the resistance R is inversely proportional\nto the cross-sectional area,\n1RA∝ (3.7)\nCombining Eqs. (3.5) and (3.7), we have\nlRA∝ (3.8)\nand hence for a given conductor\nlRAρ= (3.9)\nwhere the constant of proportionality r depends on the material of the\nconductor but not on its dimensions. r is called resistivity .\nUsing the last equation, Ohm’s law reads\nI lV I RAρ= × = (3.10)\nCurrent per unit area (taken normal to the current), I/A, is called\ncurrent density  and is denoted by j. The SI units of the current density\nare A/m2. Further , if E is the magnitude of unifor m electric field in the\nconductor whose length is l, then the potential difference V across its\nends is El. Using these, the last equation readsGEORG SIMON OHM (1787– 1854)\nGeorg Simon Ohm  (1787–\n1854) German physicist,\nprofessor at Munich. Ohm\nwas led to his law by an\nanalogy between the\nconduction of heat: the\nelectric field is analogous to\nthe temperature gradient,\nand the electric current is\nanalogous to the heat flow.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCurrent\nElectricity\n85        E l = j r l\nor,    E = j  r (3.11)\nThe above relation for magnitudes E and j can indeed be cast in a\nvector  form. The current density, (which we have defined as the current\nthrough unit ar ea normal to the curr ent) is also dir ected along E, and is\nalso a vector j (º ºº ºº j E/E). Thus, the last equation can be written as,\n        E = jr (3.12)\nor,   j = s E (3.13)\nwhere s º1/r is called the conductivity . Ohm’s law is often stated in an\nequivalent form, Eq. (3.13) in addition to Eq.(3.3). In the next section, we\nwill try to understand the origin of the Ohm’s law as arising from the\ncharacteristics of the drift of electrons.\n3.5DRIFT OF ELECTRONS  AND THE O RIGIN\nOF RESISTIVITY\nAs remarked before, an electron will suffer collisions with the heavy fixed\nions, but after collision, it will emerge with the same speed but in random\ndirections. If we consider all the electrons, their average velocity will be\nzero since their directions are random. Thus, if there are N electrons and\nthe velocity of the ith electron ( i = 1, 2, 3, ... N ) at a given time is vi, then\n10\n1Ni\niv=\n=∑N\n(3.14)\nConsider now the situation when an electric field is\npresent. Electrons will be accelerated due to this\nfield by\n=– Eae\nm(3.15)\nwhere – e is the charge and  m is the mass of an electron.\nConsider again the ith electron at a given time t. This\nelectron would have had its last collision some time\nbefore t, and let ti be the time elapsed after its last\ncollision. If vi was its velocity immediately after the last\ncollision, then its velocity Vi at time t is\n−  = +     EV vi i ietm(3.16)\nsince starting with its last collision it was accelerated\n(Fig. 3.3) with an acceleration given by Eq. (3.15) for a\ntime interval ti. The average velocity of the electrons at\ntime t is the average of all the Vi’s. The average of vi’s is\nzero [Eq. (3.14)] since immediately after any collision,\nthe direction of the velocity of an electron is completely\nrandom. The collisions of the electrons do not occur at\nregular intervals but at random times. Let us denote by\nt, the average time between successive collisions. Then\nat a given time, some of the electrons would have spentFIGURE  3.3 A schematic picture of\nan electron moving from a point A to\nanother point B through repeated\ncollisions, and straight line travel\nbetween collisions (full lines). If an\nelectric field is applied as shown, the\nelectron ends up at point B ¢ (dotted\nlines). A slight drift in a direction\nopposite the electric field is visible.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPhysics\n86time more than t and some less than t. In other words, the time ti in\nEq. (3.16) will be less than t for some and more than t for others as we go\nthrough the values of i = 1, 2 ..... N. The average value of ti then is t\n(known as relaxation time ). Thus, averaging Eq. (3.16) over the\nN-electrons at any given time t gives us for the average velocity vd\n( ) ( ) ( ) ≡ = −Ev V vd i i i average average averageetm\n0 –τ τ = =−E Ee e\nm m(3.17)\nThis last result is surprising. It tells us that the\nelectrons move with an average velocity which is\nindependent of time, although electrons are\naccelerated. This is the phenomenon of drift and the\nvelocity vd in Eq. (3.17) is called the drift velocity .\nBecause of the drift, there will be net transport of\ncharges across any area perpendicular to E. Consider\na planar area A, located inside the conductor such that\nthe normal to the area is parallel to E (Fig. 3.4). Then\nbecause of the drift, in an infinitesimal amount of time\nDt, all electrons to the left of the area at distances upto\n|vd|Dt would have crossed the area. If n is the number\nof free electrons per unit volume in the metal, then\nthere are n Dt |vd|A such electrons. Since each\nelectron carries a charge – e, the total charge transported across this area\nA to the right in time Dt is –ne A|vd|Dt. E is directed towards the left and\nhence the total charge transported along E across the area is negative of\nthis. The amount of charge crossing the area A in time Dt is by definition\n[Eq. (3.2)]  I Dt, where I is the magnitude of the current. Hence,\nv Δ = + Δd I t n e A t (3.18)\nSubstituting the value of | vd| from Eq. (3.17)\n2\nEτ Δ = Δe AI t n tm(3.19)\nBy definition I is related to the magnitude |j| of the current density by\nI = |j| A (3.20)\nHence, from Eqs.(3.19) and (3.20),\n2\nj Eτ=ne\nm(3.21)\nThe vector j is parallel to E and hence we can write Eq. (3.21) in the\nvector form\n2\nτ=j Ene\nm(3.22)\nComparison with Eq. (3.13) shows that Eq. (3.22) is exactly the Ohm’s\nlaw, if we identify the conductivity s  asFIGURE  3.4 Current in a metallic\nconductor . The magnitude of curr ent\ndensity in a metal is the magnitude of\ncharge contained in a cylinder of unit\narea and length vd.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCurrent\nElectricity\n87\n EXAMPLE  3.12ne\nmσ τ= (3.23)\nWe thus see that a very simple pictur e of electrical conduction\nreproduces Ohm’s law. W e have, of course, made assumptions that t\nand n are constants, independent of E. We shall, in the next section,\ndiscuss the limitations of Ohm’s law.\nExample 3.1 (a) Estimate the average drift speed of conduction\nelectrons in a copper wire of cross-sectional area 1.0 × 10–7 m2 carrying\na current of 1.5 A. Assume that each copper atom contributes roughly\none conduction electron. The density of copper is 9.0 × 103 kg/m3,\nand its atomic mass is 63.5 u. (b) Compare the drift speed obtained\nabove with, (i) thermal speeds of copper atoms at ordinary\ntemperatures, (ii) speed of propagation of electric field along the\nconductor which causes the drift motion.\nSolution\n(a)The direction of drift velocity of conduction electrons is opposite\nto the electric field direction, i.e., electrons drift in the direction\nof increasing potential. The drift speed vd is given by Eq. (3.18)\nvd  = (I/neA)\nNow, e = 1.6 × 10–19 C, A = 1.0 × 10–7m2, I = 1.5 A. The density of\nconduction electrons, n is equal to the number of atoms per cubic\nmetre (assuming one conduction electron per Cu atom as is\nreasonable from its valence electron count of one). A cubic metre\nof copper has a mass of 9.0 × 103 kg. Since 6.0 × 1023 copper\natoms have a mass of 63.5 g,\n23\n6 6.0 109.0 1063.5n×= × ×\n   = 8.5 × 1028 m–3\nwhich gives,\n28 –19 –71.5\n8.5 10 1.6 10 1.0 10=× × × × ×dv\n    = 1.1 × 10–3 m s–1  = 1.1 mm s–1\n(b)(i) At a temperature T, the thermal speed * of a copper atom of\nmass M is obtained from [<(1/2) Mv2 > = (3/2) kBT ] and is thus\ntypically of the order of /Bk T M , where kB is the Boltzmann\nconstant. For copper at 300 K, this is about 2 × 102 m/s. This\nfigure indicates the random vibrational speeds of copper atoms\nin a conductor . Note that the drift speed of electr ons is much\nsmaller , about 10–5 times the typical ther mal speed at or dinary\ntemperatures.\n(ii) An electric field travelling along the conductor has a speed of\nan electromagnetic wave, namely equal to 3.0 × 108 m s–1\n(You will lear n about this in ",

      "content": "Chapter 8). The drift speed is, in\ncomparison, extremely small; smaller by a factor of 10–11.\n*See Eq. (12.23) of Chapter 12 from Class XI book.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPhysics\n88\n EXAMPLE  3.2Example 3.2\n(a)In Example 3.1, the electron drift speed is estimated to be only a\nfew mm s–1 for currents in the range of a few amperes? How then\nis current established almost the instant a circuit is closed?\n(b)The electron drift arises due to the force experienced by electrons\nin the electric field inside the conductor . But for ce should cause\nacceleration.

Establishment of a current does not have to wait for electrons\nfrom one end of the conductor travelling to the other end. However ,\nit does take a little while for the current to reach its steady value.\n(b)Each ‘free’ electron does accelerate, increasing its drift speed until\nit collides with a positive ion of the metal. It loses its drift speed\nafter collision but starts to accelerate and increases its drift speed\nagain only to suffer a collision again and so on. On the average,\ntherefore, electrons acquire only a drift speed.\n(c)Simple, because the electron number density is enormous,\n~1029 m–3.\n(d)By no means. The drift velocity is superposed over the large\nrandom velocities of electrons.\n(e)In the absence of electric field, the paths are straight lines; in the\npresence of electric field, the paths are, in general, curved.\n3.5.1  Mobility\nAs we have seen, conductivity arises from mobile charge carriers. In\nmetals, these mobile charge carriers are electrons; in an ionised gas, they\nare electrons and positive charged ions; in an electrolyte, these can be\nboth positive and negative ions.\nAn important quantity is the mobility  m defined as the magnitude of\nthe drift velocity per unit electric field:\n| |d\nEµ=v\n(3.24)\nThe SI unit of mobility is m2/Vs and is 104 of the mobility in practical\nunits (cm2/Vs).

The deviations broadly are one or more of the following\ntypes:\n(a)V ceases to be proportional to I (Fig. 3.5).\n(b)The r elation between V and I depends on the sign of V. In\nother words, if I is the current for a certain V , then reversing\nthe direction of V keeping its magnitude fixed, does not\nproduce a current of the same magnitude as I in the opposite direction\n(Fig. 3.6). This happens, for example, in a diode which we will study\nin Chapter 14.\n(c)The relation between V and I is not unique, i.e., there is more than\none value of V for the same current I (Fig. 3.7). A material exhibiting\nsuch behaviour is GaAs.\nMaterials and devices not obeying Ohm’s law in the form of Eq. (3.3)\nare actually widely used in electronic circuits. In this and a few\nsubsequent chapters, however , we will study the electrical curr ents in\nmaterials that obey Ohm’s law.\n3.7  R ESISTIVITY OF VARIOUS  MATERIALS\nThe materials are classified as conductors, semiconductors and insulators\ndepending on their resistivities, in an increasing order of their values.FIGURE  3.5 The dashed line\nrepresents the linear Ohm’s\nlaw. The solid line is the voltage\nV versus current I for a good\nconductor .\nFIGURE  3.6 Characteristic curve\nof a diode. Note the different\nscales for negative and positive\nvalues of the voltage and current.FIGURE  3.7 Variation of curr ent\nversus voltage for GaAs.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPhysics\n90Metals have low resistivities in the range of 10–8 Wm to 10–6 Wm. At the\nother end are insulators like ceramic, rubber and plastics having\nresistivities 1018 times greater than metals or more. In between the two\nare the semiconductors. These, however , have r esistivities\ncharacteristically decreasing with a rise in temperature. The resistivities\nof semiconductors can be decreased by adding small amount of suitable\nimpurities. This last feature is exploited in use of semiconductors for\nelectronic devices.\n3.8 TEMPERA TURE DEPENDENCE  OF RESISTIVITY\nThe resistivity of a material is found to be dependent on the temperature.\nDifferent materials do not exhibit the same dependence on temperatures.\nOver a limited range of temperatures, that is not too large, the resistivity\nof a metallic conductor is approximately given by,\nrT = r0 [1 + a (T–T0)] (3.26)\nwhere rT is the resistivity at a temperature T and r0 is the same at a\nreference temperature T0. a is called the temperature co-efficient of\nresistivity, and from Eq. (3.26), the dimension of a is (Temperature)–1.\nFor  metals, a is positive.\nThe relation of Eq. (3.26) implies that a graph of rT plotted against T\nwould be a straight line. At temperatures much lower than 0°C, the graph,\nhowever , deviates considerably fr om a straight line (Fig. 3.8).\nEquation (3.26) thus, can be used approximately over a limited range\nof T around any reference temperature T0, where the graph can be\napproximated as a straight line.\nFIGURE  3.8\nResistivity rT of\ncopper as a function\nof temperature T.FIGURE  3.9 Resistivity\nrT of nichrome as a\nfunction of absolute\ntemperature  T.FIGURE  3.10\nTemperature dependence\nof resistivity for a typical\nsemiconductor .\nSome materials like Nichrome (which is an alloy of nickel, iron and\nchromium) exhibit a very weak dependence of resistivity with temperature\n(Fig. 3.9). Manganin and constantan have similar properties. These\nmaterials are thus widely used in wire bound standard resistors since\ntheir resistance values would change very little with temperatures.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCurrent\nElectricity\n91\n EXAMPLE  3.3Unlike metals, the resistivities of semiconductors decrease with\nincreasing temperatures. A typical dependence is shown in Fig. 3.10.\nWe can qualitatively understand the temperatur e dependence of\nresistivity, in the light of our derivation of Eq. (3.23). From this equation,\nresistivity of a material is given by\n21 m\nn eρσ τ= = (3.27)\nr thus depends inversely both on the number n of free electrons per unit\nvolume and on the average time t between collisions. As we increase\ntemperature, average speed of the electrons, which act as the carriers of\ncurrent, increases resulting in more frequent collisions. The average time\nof collisions t, thus decreases with temperature.\nIn a metal, n is not dependent on temperature to any appreciable\nextent and thus the decrease in the value of t with rise in temperature\ncauses r to increase as we have observed.\nFor insulators and semiconductors, however , n incr eases with\ntemperature. This increase more than compensates any decrease in t in\nEq.(3.23) so that for such materials, r decreases with temperature.\nExample 3.3  An electric toaster uses nichrome for its heating\nelement. When a negligibly small current passes through it, its\nresistance at r oom temperatur e (27.0 °C) is found to be 75.3 W. When\nthe toaster is connected to a 230 V supply, the current settles, after\na few seconds, to a steady value of 2.68 A. What is the steady\ntemperature of the nichrome element? The temperature coefficient\nof resistance of nichrome averaged over the temperature range\ninvolved, is 1.70 × 10–4 °C–1.\nSolution   When the current through the element is very small, heating\neffects can be ignored and the temperature T1 of the element is the\nsame as room temperature. When the toaster is connected to the\nsupply, its initial current will be slightly higher than its steady value\nof 2.68 A. But due to heating effect of the current, the temperature\nwill rise. This will cause an increase in resistance and a slight\ndecrease in current. In a few seconds, a steady state will be reached\nwhen temperatur e will rise no further , and both the r esistance of the\nelement and the current drawn will achieve steady values. The\nresistance R2 at the steady temperature T2 is\nR2 230 V85.82.68 A= = Ω\nUsing the relation\nR2 = R1 [1 + a (T2 – T1)]\nwith a = 1.70 × 10–4 °C–1, we get\nT2 – T1 –4(85.8 – 75.3)\n(75.3) 1.70 10=× ×  = 820 °C\nthat is,  T2 = (820 + 27.0) °C = 847 °C\nThus, the steady temperature of the heating element (when heating\neffect due to the current equals heat loss to the surroundings) is\n847 °C.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPhysics\n92\n EXAMPLE  3.4Example 3.4 The resistance of the platinum wire of a platinum\nresistance thermometer at the ice point is 5 W and at steam point is\n5.23 W.

The electric potential at A and B are denoted by V(A)\nand V(B) respectively. Since current is flowing from A to B, V(A) > V(B)\nand the potential difference across  AB is V = V(A) – V(B) > 0.\nIn a time interval Dt, an amount of charge DQ = I Dt travels from A to\nB. The potential energy of the charge at A, by definition, was Q V(A) and\nsimilarly at B, it is Q V(B). Thus, change in its potential energy DUpot is\nDUpot = Final potential energy – Initial potential energy\n         = DQ[(V (B) – V (A)] = – DQ V\n         = – I VDt < 0 (3.28)\nIf char ges moved without collisions thr ough the conductor , their\nkinetic energy would also change so that the total energy is unchanged.\nConservation of total energy would then imply that,\nDK =  – D\nUpot(3.29)\nthat is,\nDK = I VDt > 0 (3.30)\nThus, in case charges were moving freely through the conductor under\nthe action of electric field, their kinetic energy would increase as they\nmove. W e have, however , seen earlier that on the average, char ge carriers\ndo not move with acceleration but with a steady drift velocity. This is\nbecause of the collisions with ions and atoms during transit. During\ncollisions, the energy gained by the charges thus is shared with the atoms.\nThe atoms vibrate more vigorously, i.e., the conductor heats up. Thus,\nin an actual conductor , an amount of ener gy dissipated as heat in the\nconductor during the time interval Dt is,\nDW = I VDt (3.31)\nThe energy dissipated per unit time is the power dissipated\nP = DW/Dt  and we have,\nP = I V (3.32)\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCurrent\nElectricity\n93Using Ohm’s law V = IR , we get\nP = I 2 R = V 2/R (3.33)\nas the power loss (“ohmic loss”) in a conductor of resistance R carrying a\ncurrent I. It is this power which heats up, for example, the coil of an\nelectric bulb to incandescence, radiating out heat and light.\nWhere does the power come from? As we have\nreasoned before, we need an external source to keep\na steady curr ent thr ough the conductor . It is clearly\nthis sour ce which must supply this power . In the\nsimple circuit shown with a cell (Fig.3.11), it is the\nchemical energy of the cell which supplies this power\nfor as long as it can.\nThe expr essions for power , Eqs. (3.32) and (3.33),\nshow the dependence of the power dissipated in a\nresistor R on the current through it and the voltage\nacross it.\nEquation (3.33) has an important application to\npower transmission. Electrical power is transmitted\nfrom power stations to homes and factories, which\nmay be hundreds of miles away, via transmission\ncables. One obviously wants to minimise the power\nloss in the transmission cables connecting the power stations to homes\nand factories. W e shall  see now how this can be achieved. Consider a\ndevice R, to which a power P is to be delivered via transmission cables\nhaving a resistance Rc to be dissipated by it finally. If V is the voltage\nacross R and I the current through it, then\nP = V I (3.34)\nThe connecting wires from the power station to the device has a finite\nresistance Rc. The power dissipated in the connecting wires, which is\nwasted is Pc  with\nPc = I2 Rc\n   2\n2cP R\nV= (3.35)\nfrom Eq. (3.32). Thus, to drive a device of power P, the power wasted in the\nconnecting wires is inversely proportional to V 2. The  transmission cables\nfrom power stations are hundreds of miles long and their resistance Rc is\nconsiderable. To reduce Pc, these wires carry current at enormous values\nof V and this is the reason for the high voltage danger signs on transmission\nlines — a common sight as we move away from populated areas. Using\nelectricity at such voltages is not safe and hence at the other end, a device\ncalled a transformer lowers the voltage to a value suitable for use.\n3.10 C ELLS, EMF, INTERNAL  RESIST ANCE\nWe have alr eady mentioned that a simple device to maintain a steady\ncurrent in an electric circuit is the electrolytic cell. Basically a cell has\ntwo electrodes, called the positive (P) and the negative (N), as shown inFIGURE  3.11  Heat is produced in the\nresistor R which is connected across\nthe terminals of a cell. The energy\ndissipated in the resistor R comes from\nthe chemical energy of the electrolyte.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPhysics\n94Fig. 3.12. They are immersed in an electrolytic solution. Dipped in\nthe solution, the electrodes exchange charges with the electrolyte.\nThe positive electrode has a potential difference V+ (V+ > 0) between\nitself and the electrolyte solution immediately adjacent to it marked\nA in the figure. Similarly, the negative electrode develops a negative\npotential  – ( V– ) (V– ≥ 0) relative to the electrolyte adjacent to it,\nmarked as B in the figure. When there is no current, the electrolyte\nhas the same potential throughout, so that the potential difference\nbetween P and N is V+ – (–V–) = V+ + V– . This difference is called the\nelectromotive force  (emf) of the cell and is denoted by e. Thus\ne = V++V– >  0 (3.36)\nNote that e is, actually, a potential difference and not a force . The\nname emf, however , is used because of historical r easons, and was\ngiven at a time when the phenomenon was not understood properly.\nTo understand the significance of e, consider a resistor R\nconnected across the cell (Fig. 3.12). A current I flows across R\nfrom C to D. As explained before, a steady current is maintained\nbecause current flows from N to P through the electrolyte. Clearly,\nacross the electrolyte the same current flows through the electrolyte\nbut fr om N to P , wher eas thr ough R, it flows fr om P to N.\nThe electrolyte through which a current flows has a finite\nresistance r, called the inter nal r esistance . Consider first the\nsituation when R is infinite so that I = V/R = 0, where V is the\npotential difference between P and N. Now,\nV = Potential difference between P and A\n       + Potential difference between A and B\n       + Potential  difference between B and N\n   = e (3.37)\nThus, emf e is the potential difference between the positive and\nnegative electrodes in an open circuit, i.e., when no current is\nflowing through the cell.\nIf however R is finite, I is not zero. In that case the potential difference\nbetween P and N is\nV = V++ V– – I r\n   = e – I r (3.38)\nNote the negative sign in the expression ( I r) for the potential difference\nbetween A and B. This is because the current I flows from B to A in the\nelectrolyte.\nIn  practical calculations, internal resistances of cells in the circuit\nmay be neglected when the  curr ent I is such that e >> I r. The actual\nvalues of the internal resistances of cells vary from cell to cell. The internal\nresistance of dry cells, however , is much higher than the common\nelectrolytic cells.\nWe also observe that since V is the potential dif ference acr oss R, we\nhave from Ohm’s law\nV = I  R (3.39)\nCombining Eqs. (3.38) and (3.39), we getFIGURE  3.12  (a) Sketch of\nan electrolyte cell with\npositive terminal P and\nnegative terminal N. The\ngap between the electrodes\nis exaggerated for clarity. A\nand B are points in the\nelectrolyte typically close to\nP and N. (b) the symbol for\na cell, + referring to P and\n– referring to the N\nelectrode.

However , in most cells the maximum allowed current\nis much lower than this to prevent permanent damage to the cell.\n3.11  3.11  3.11  3.11  3.11  C CC CCELLS ELLSELLS ELLSELLS     IN ININ ININ S  S S S SERIES ERIESERIES ERIESERIES     AND ANDAND ANDAND     IN ININ ININ P  P P P PARALLEL ARALLELARALLEL ARALLELARALLEL\nLike resistors, cells can be combined together in an electric circuit. And\nlike resistors, one can, for calculating currents and voltages in a circuit,\nreplace a combination of cells by an equivalent cell.\nFIGURE FIGUREFIGURE FIGUREFIGURE  3.13  3.13 3.13  3.13 3.13  Two cells of emf’s e1 and e2 in the series. r1, r2 are their\ninternal resistances.

Then V (A) – V (B) is the potential difference between the positive\nand negative terminals of the first cell. W e have already calculated it in\nEq.

(3.42) would change to VBC = –e2–Ir2 and we will get\neeq = e1 – e2         ( e1 > e2) (3.47)\nThe rule for series combination clearly can be extended to any number\nof cells:\n(i)The equivalent emf of a series combination of n cells is just the sum of\ntheir individual emf’s, and\n(ii)The equivalent internal resistance of a series combination of n cells is\njust the sum of their internal resistances.\nThis is so, when the current leaves each cell from the positive\nelectrode. If in the combination, the current leaves any cell from\nthe negative electrode, the emf of the cell enters the expression\nfor eeq with a negative sign, as in Eq. (3.47).\nNext, consider a parallel combination of the cells (Fig. 3.14).\nI1 and I2 are the currents leaving the positive electrodes of the\ncells. At the point B1, I1 and I2 flow in whereas the current I flows\nout. Since as much charge flows in as out, we have\nI = I1 + I2(3.48)\nLet V (B1) and V (B2) be the potentials at B1 and B2, respectively.\nThen, considering the first cell, the potential difference across its\nterminals is V (B1) – V (B2).

Two rules, called Kirchhoff’s rules ,\nare very useful for analysis of electric circuits.\nGiven a circuit, we start by labelling currents in each resistor by a\nsymbol, say I, and a directed arrow to indicate that a current I flows\nalong the resistor in the direction indicated. If ultimately I is determined\nto be positive, the actual current in the resistor is in the direction of the\narrow. If I turns out to be negative, the current actually flows in a direction\nopposite to the arrow. Similarly, for each source (i.e., cell or some other\nsource of electrical power) the positive and negative electrodes are labelled,\nas well as, a directed arrow with a symbol for the current flowing through\nthe cell. This will tell us the potential difference, V = V (P) – V (N) = e – I r\n[Eq. (3.38) between the positive terminal P and the negative terminal N; I\nhere is the current flowing from N to P through the cell]. If, while labelling\nthe current I through the cell one goes from P to N, then of course\nV = e + I r (3.60)\nHaving clarified labelling, we now state the rules and the proof:\n(a) Junction rule:  At any junction, the sum of the currents entering\nthe junction is equal to the sum of currents leaving the junction\n(Fig. 3.15).Gustav Robert  Kirchhoff\n(1824 – 1887)  German\nphysicist, professor at\nHeidelberg and at\nBerlin. Mainly known for\nhis development of\nspectroscopy, he also\nmade many important\ncontributions to mathe-\nmatical physics, among\nthem, his first and\nsecond rules for circuits.\nGUST AV ROBER T KIRCHHOFF (1824 –\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPhysics\n98\n EXAMPLE  3.5This applies equally well if instead of a junction of\nseveral lines, we consider a point in a line.\nThe proof of this rule follows from the fact that\nwhen currents are steady, there is no accumulation\nof charges at any junction or at any point in a line.\nThus, the total current flowing in, (which is the rate\nat which charge flows into the junction), must equal\nthe total current flowing out.\n(b) Loop rule:  The algebraic sum of changes in\npotential around any closed loop involving\nresistors and cells in the loop is zero\n(Fig. 3.15).\nThis rule is also obvious, since electric potential is\ndependent on the location of the point. Thus\nstarting with any point if we come back to the same\npoint, the total change must be zero. In a closed\nloop, we do come back to the starting point and\nhence the rule.FIGURE  3.15  At junction a the current\nleaving is I1 + I2 and current entering is I3.\nThe junction rule says I3 = I1 + I2. At point\nh current entering is I1. There is only one\ncurrent leaving h and by junction rule\nthat will also be I1. For the loops ‘ahdcba’\nand ‘ahdefga’, the loop rules give –30 I1 –\n41 I3 + 45 = 0 and –30 I1 + 21 I2 – 80 = 0.\nExample 3.5  A battery of 10 V and negligible internal resistance is\nconnected across the diagonally opposite corners of a cubical network\nconsisting of 12 resistors each of resistance 1 W (Fig. 3.16). Determine\nthe equivalent resistance of the network and the current along each\nedge of the cube.\nZ\nFIGURE  3.16\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCurrent\nElectricity\n99\n EXAMPLE  3.5Similation for application of Kirchhoff ’s rules:\nhttp://www.phys.hawaii.edu/~teb/optics/java/kirch3/\n EXAMPLE  3.6Solution   The network is not reducible to a simple series and parallel\ncombinations of r esistors. Ther e is, however , a clear symmetry in the\nproblem which we can exploit to obtain the equivalent resistance of\nthe network.\nThe paths AA ¢, AD and AB are obviously symmetrically placed in the\nnetwork. Thus, the curr ent in each must be the same, say, I. Further ,\nat the corners A ¢, B and D, the incoming current I must split equally\ninto the two outgoing branches. In this manner , the curr ent in all\nthe 12 edges of the cube are easily written down in terms of I, using\nKirchhoff’s first rule and the symmetry in the problem.\nNext take a closed loop, say, ABCC ¢EA, and apply Kirchhoff’s second\nrule:\n–IR – (1/2) IR – IR + e = 0\nwhere R is the resistance of each edge and e the emf of battery. Thus,\ne = 5\n2I R\nThe equivalent resistance Req of the network is\n5\n3 6eqR RIε= =\nFor R = 1 W, Req = (5/6)  W and for e = 10 V, the total current (= 3 I) in\nthe network is\n3I = 10 V/(5/6)  W = 12 A, i.e., I = 4 A\nThe current flowing in each edge can now be read off from the\nFig. 3.16.\nIt should be noted that because of the symmetry of the network, the\ngreat power of Kirchhoff’s rules has not been very apparent in Example 3. 5.\nIn a general network, there will be no such simplification due to symmetry,\nand only by application of Kirchhoff’s rules to junctions and closed loops\n(as many as necessary to solve the unknowns in the network) can we\nhandle the problem. This will be illustrated in Example 3.6.\nExample 3.6  Determine the current in each branch of the network\nshown in Fig. 3.17.\nFIGURE  3.17\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPhysics\n100\n EXAMPLE  3.6Solution   Each branch of the network is assigned an unknown current\nto be determined by the application of Kirchhoff’s rules. To reduce\nthe number of unknowns at the outset, the first rule of Kirchhoff is\nused at every junction to assign the unknown current in each branch.\nWe then have thr ee unknowns I1, I2 and I3 which can be found by\napplying the second rule of Kirchhoff to three different closed loops.\nKirchhoff’s second rule for the closed loop ADCA gives,\n10 – 4( I1– I2) + 2( I2 + I3 – I1) – I1 = 0 [3.61(a)]\nthat is, 7 I1– 6I2 – 2I3 = 10\nFor the closed loop ABCA, we get\n10 – 4 I2– 2 (I2 + I3) – I1 = 0\nthat is, I1 + 6I2 + 2I3 =10 [3.61(b)]\nFor the closed loop BCDEB, we get\n5 – 2 ( I2 + I3) – 2 ( I2 + I3 – I1) = 0\nthat is, 2 I1 – 4I2 – 4I3 = –5 [3.61(c)]\nEquations (3.61 a, b, c) are three simultaneous equations in three\nunknowns. These can be solved by the usual method to give\nI1 = 2.5A,   I2 = 5\n8 A,   I3 = 718  A\nThe currents in the various branches of the network are\nAB : 5\n8 A,   CA : 122 A,   DEB : 718  A\nAD : 718 A,   CD : 0 A,   BC : 122 A\nIt is easily verified that Kirchhoff’s second rule applied to the\nremaining closed loops does not provide any additional independent\nequation, that is, the above values of currents satisfy the second\nrule for every closed loop of the network. For example, the total voltage\ndrop over the closed loop BADEB\n55\n8415\n84 V V V+ ×\n\n− ×\n\n\nequal to zero, as required by Kirchhoff’s second rule.\n3.13  W HEATSTONE  BRIDGE\nAs an application of Kirchhoff’s rules consider the circuit shown in\nFig. 3.18, which is called the Wheatstone bridge . The bridge has\nfour resistors R1, R2, R3 and R4. Across one pair of diagonally opposite\npoints (A and C in the figure) a source is connected. This ( i.e., AC) is\ncalled the battery arm. Between the other two vertices, B and D, a\ngalvanometer G (which is a device to detect currents) is connected. This\nline, shown as BD in the figure, is called the galvanometer arm.\nFor simplicity, we assume that the cell has no internal resistance. In\ngeneral there will be currents flowing across all the resistors as well as a\ncurrent Ig through G. Of special interest, is the case of a balanced  bridge\nwher e the r esistors ar e such that Ig = 0. W e can easily get the balance\ncondition, such that there is no current through G. In this case, the\nKirchhoff’s junction rule applied to junctions D and B (see the figure )\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCurrent\nElectricity\n101FIGURE  3.18\n EXAMPLE  3.7immediately gives us the relations I1 = I3 and I2 = I4. Next, we apply\nKirchhoff’s loop rule to closed loops ADBA  and CBDC. The first\nloop gives\n–I1 R1 + 0 + I2 R2 = 0        ( Ig = 0)   (3.62)\nand the second loop gives, upon using I3 = I1, I4 = I2\nI2 R4 + 0 – I1 R3 = 0         (3.63)\nFrom Eq. (3.62), we obtain,\n1 2\n2 1I R\nI R=\nwhereas from Eq.

Let us suppose we\nhave an unknown resistance, which we insert in the fourth arm; R4 is\nthus not known. Keeping known resistances R1 and R2 in the first and\nsecond arm of the bridge, we go on varying R3 till the galvanometer shows\na null deflection. The bridge then is balanced, and from the balance\ncondition the value of the unknown resistance R4 is given by,\n2\n4 3\n1RR RR= [3.64(b)]\nA practical device using this principle is called the meter bridge .\nExample 3.7  The four arms of a Wheatstone bridge (Fig. 3.19) have\nthe following resistances:\nAB = 100 W, BC = 10 W, CD = 5W, and DA = 60 W.\nFIGURE  3.19\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPhysics\n102\n EXAMPLE  3.7 A galvanometer of 15 W resistance is connected across BD.

(3.65b) by 10\n20I1 – 60 Ig – 10 I2 = 0 [3.65(d)]\nFrom Eqs. (3.65d) and (3.65a) we have\n63Ig – 2I2 = 0\nI2 = 31.5 Ig[3.65(e)]\nSubstituting the value of I2 into Eq. [3.65(c)], we get\n13 (31.5 Ig ) + Ig = 2\n410.5 Ig = 2\nIg = 4.87 mA.\nSUMMARY\n1.Current  through a given area of a conductor is the net charge passing\nper unit time through the area.\n2.To maintain a steady current, we must have a closed circuit in which\nan external agency moves electric charge from lower to higher potential\nenergy. The work done per unit charge by the source in taking the\ncharge from lower to higher potential energy (i.e., from one terminal\nof the source to the other) is called the electromotive force, or emf, of\nthe source. Note that the emf is not a force; it is the voltage difference\nbetween the two terminals of a source in open circuit.\n3.Ohm’s law : The electric current I flowing through a substance is\nproportional to the voltage V across its ends, i.e., V µ I or V = RI,\nwhere R is called the resistance  of the substance. The unit of resistance\nis ohm: 1 W = 1 V A–1.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCurrent\nElectricity\n1034.The resistance  R of a conductor depends on its length l and\ncross-sectional area A through the relation,\nlRAρ=\nwher e r, called resistivity  is a pr operty of the material and depends on\ntemperature and pressure.\n5.Electrical resistivity  of substances varies over a very wide range. Metals\nhave low resistivity, in the range of 10–8 W m to 10–6 W m. Insulators\nlike glass and rubber have 1022 to 1024 times greater resistivity.\nSemiconductors like Si and Ge lie roughly in the middle range of\nresistivity on a logarithmic scale.\n6.In most substances, the carriers of current are electrons; in some\ncases, for example, ionic crystals and electrolytic liquids, positive and\nnegative ions carry the electric current.\n7.Current density  j gives the amount of charge flowing per second per\nunit area normal to the flow,\nj = nq vd\nwhere n is the number density (number per unit volume) of charge\ncarriers each of charge q, and vd is the drift velocity  of the charge\ncarriers. For electrons  q = – e. If j is normal to a cross-sectional area\nA and is constant over the area, the magnitude of the current I through\nthe area is nevd A.\n8.Using E = V/l, I = nevd A, and Ohm’s law, one obtains\n2\ndeE nevm mρ=\nThe proportionality between the force eE  on the electrons in a metal\ndue to the external field E and the drift velocity vd (not acceleration)\ncan be understood, if we assume that the electrons suffer collisions\nwith ions in the metal, which deflect them randomly. If such collisions\noccur on an average at a time interval t,\nvd = at = eE t/m\nwhere a is the acceleration of the electron. This gives\n2m\nneρτ=\n9.In the temperature range in which resistivity increases linearly with\ntemperature, the temperature coefficient of resistivity  a is defined as\nthe fractional increase in resistivity per unit increase in temperature.\n10.Ohm’s law is obeyed by many substances, but it is not a fundamental\nlaw of nature. It fails if\n(a)V depends on I non-linearly.\n(b)the relation between V and I depends on the sign of V for the same\nabsolute value of V.\n(c)The relation between V and I is non-unique.\nAn example of (a) is when r increases with I (even if temperature is\nkept fixed). A rectifier combines features (a) and (b). GaAs shows the\nfeature (c).\n11.When a source of emf e is connected to an external resistance R, the\nvoltage Vext across R is given by\nVext = IR = RR rε\n+\nwhere r is the internal resistance  of the source.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPhysics\n104Physical Quantity Symbol Dimensions Unit Remark\nElectric current I [A] A SI base unit\nCharge Q, q [T A] C\nVoltage, Electric V [M L2 T–3 A–1] V Work/char ge\npotential difference\nElectromotive force e [M L2 T–3 A–1] V Work/char ge\nResistance R [M L2 T–3 A–2] W R = V /I\nResistivity r [M L3 T–3 A–2] W m R = rl/A\nElectrical s [M–1 L–3 T3 A2] S s = 1/ r\nconductivity\nElectric field E [M L T–3 A–1] V m–1 Electric force\ncharge\nDrift speed vd[L T–1] m s–1vde E\nm=τ\nRelaxation time t [T] s\nCurrent density j [L–2 A] A m–2current/area\nMobility m [M L3 T–4 A–1]m2 V–1s–1/dv E12.Kirchhoff’s Rules –\n(a)Junction Rule: At any junction of circuit elements, the sum of\ncurrents entering the junction must equal the sum of currents\nleaving it.\n(b)Loop Rule:  The algebraic sum of changes in potential around any\nclosed loop must be zero.\n13.The Wheatstone bridge  is an arrangement of four resistances – R1, R2,\nR3, R4 as shown in the text. The null-point condition is given by\n3 1\n2 4R R\nR R=\nusing which the value of one resistance can be determined, knowing\nthe other three resistances.\nPOINTS TO PONDER\n1.Current is a scalar although we represent current with an arrow.\nCurrents do not obey the  law of vector addition. That current is a\nscalar also follows from it’s  definition. The current I through an area\nof cross-section is given by the scalar product of two vectors:\nI =  j . DS\nwhere j and DS are vectors.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCurrent\nElectricity\n1052.Refer to V-I curves of a resistor and a diode as drawn in the text. A\nresistor obeys Ohm’s law while a diode does not. The assertion that\nV = IR is a statement of Ohm’s law is not true. This equation defines\nresistance and it may be applied to all conducting devices whether\nthey obey Ohm’s law or not. The Ohm’s law asserts that the plot of I\nversus V is linear i.e., R is independent of V.\nEquation E = ρ j leads to another statement of Ohm’s  law, i.e., a\nconducting material obeys Ohm’s law when the resistivity of the\nmaterial does not depend on the magnitude and direction of applied\nelectric field.\n3.Homogeneous conductors like silver or semiconductors like pure\ngermanium or germanium containing impurities obey Ohm’s law within\nsome range of electric field values. If the field becomes too strong,\nthere are departures from Ohm’s law in all cases.\n4.Motion of conduction electrons in electric field E is the sum of (i)\nmotion due to random collisions and (ii) that due to E.

Why then do the electrons acquire a steady average\ndrift speed?\n(c)If the electron drift speed is so small, and the electron’s charge is\nsmall, how can we still obtain large amounts of current in a\nconductor?\n(d)When electrons drift in a metal from lower to higher potential,\ndoes it mean that all the ‘free’ electrons of the metal are moving\nin the same direction?\n(e)Are the paths of electrons straight lines between successive\ncollisions (with the positive ions of the metal) in the (i) absence of\nelectric field, (ii) presence of electric field?\nSolution\n(a)Electric field is established throughout the circuit, almost instantly\n(with the speed of light) causing at every point a local electron\ndrift. Establishment of a current does not have to wait for electrons\nfrom one end of the conductor travelling to the other end. However ,\nit does take a little while for the current to reach its steady value.\n(b)Each ‘free’ electron does accelerate, increasing its drift speed until\nit collides with a positive ion of the metal. It loses its drift speed\nafter collision but starts to accelerate and increases its drift speed\nagain only to suffer a collision again and so on. On the average,\ntherefore, electrons acquire only a drift speed.\n(c)Simple, because the electron number density is enormous,\n~1029 m–3.\n(d)By no means. The drift velocity is superposed over the large\nrandom velocities of electrons.\n(e)In the absence of electric field, the paths are straight lines; in the\npresence of electric field, the paths are, in general, curved.\n3.5.1  Mobility\nAs we have seen, conductivity arises from mobile charge carriers. In\nmetals, these mobile charge carriers are electrons; in an ionised gas, they\nare electrons and positive charged ions; in an electrolyte, these can be\nboth positive and negative ions.\nAn important quantity is the mobility  m defined as the magnitude of\nthe drift velocity per unit electric field:\n| |d\nEµ=v\n(3.24)\nThe SI unit of mobility is m2/Vs and is 104 of the mobility in practical\nunits (cm2/Vs). Mobility is positive. From Eq. (3.17), we have\nvd = τe E\nm\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCurrent\nElectricity\n89Hence,\nτµ= =dve\nE m(3.25)\nwhere t is the average collision time for electrons.\n3.6  L IMITATIONS OF OHM’S LAW\nAlthough Ohm’s law has been found valid over a large class\nof materials, there do exist materials and devices used in\nelectric circuits where the proportionality of V and I  does not\nhold. The deviations broadly are one or more of the following\ntypes:\n(a)V ceases to be proportional to I (Fig. 3.5).\n(b)The r elation between V and I depends on the sign of V. In\nother words, if I is the current for a certain V , then reversing\nthe direction of V keeping its magnitude fixed, does not\nproduce a current of the same magnitude as I in the opposite direction\n(Fig. 3.6). This happens, for example, in a diode which we will study\nin Chapter 14.\n(c)The relation between V and I is not unique, i.e., there is more than\none value of V for the same current I (Fig. 3.7). A material exhibiting\nsuch behaviour is GaAs.\nMaterials and devices not obeying Ohm’s law in the form of Eq. (3.3)\nare actually widely used in electronic circuits. In this and a few\nsubsequent chapters, however , we will study the electrical curr ents in\nmaterials that obey Ohm’s law.\n3.7  R ESISTIVITY OF VARIOUS  MATERIALS\nThe materials are classified as conductors, semiconductors and insulators\ndepending on their resistivities, in an increasing order of their values.FIGURE  3.5 The dashed line\nrepresents the linear Ohm’s\nlaw. The solid line is the voltage\nV versus current I for a good\nconductor .\nFIGURE  3.6 Characteristic curve\nof a diode. Note the different\nscales for negative and positive\nvalues of the voltage and current.FIGURE  3.7 Variation of curr ent\nversus voltage for GaAs.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPhysics\n90Metals have low resistivities in the range of 10–8 Wm to 10–6 Wm. At the\nother end are insulators like ceramic, rubber and plastics having\nresistivities 1018 times greater than metals or more. In between the two\nare the semiconductors. These, however , have r esistivities\ncharacteristically decreasing with a rise in temperature. The resistivities\nof semiconductors can be decreased by adding small amount of suitable\nimpurities. This last feature is exploited in use of semiconductors for\nelectronic devices.\n3.8 TEMPERA TURE DEPENDENCE  OF RESISTIVITY\nThe resistivity of a material is found to be dependent on the temperature.\nDifferent materials do not exhibit the same dependence on temperatures.\nOver a limited range of temperatures, that is not too large, the resistivity\nof a metallic conductor is approximately given by,\nrT = r0 [1 + a (T–T0)] (3.26)\nwhere rT is the resistivity at a temperature T and r0 is the same at a\nreference temperature T0. a is called the temperature co-efficient of\nresistivity, and from Eq. (3.26), the dimension of a is (Temperature)–1.\nFor  metals, a is positive.\nThe relation of Eq. (3.26) implies that a graph of rT plotted against T\nwould be a straight line. At temperatures much lower than 0°C, the graph,\nhowever , deviates considerably fr om a straight line (Fig. 3.8).\nEquation (3.26) thus, can be used approximately over a limited range\nof T around any reference temperature T0, where the graph can be\napproximated as a straight line.\nFIGURE  3.8\nResistivity rT of\ncopper as a function\nof temperature T.FIGURE  3.9 Resistivity\nrT of nichrome as a\nfunction of absolute\ntemperature  T.FIGURE  3.10\nTemperature dependence\nof resistivity for a typical\nsemiconductor .\nSome materials like Nichrome (which is an alloy of nickel, iron and\nchromium) exhibit a very weak dependence of resistivity with temperature\n(Fig. 3.9). Manganin and constantan have similar properties. These\nmaterials are thus widely used in wire bound standard resistors since\ntheir resistance values would change very little with temperatures.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCurrent\nElectricity\n91\n EXAMPLE  3.3Unlike metals, the resistivities of semiconductors decrease with\nincreasing temperatures. A typical dependence is shown in Fig. 3.10.\nWe can qualitatively understand the temperatur e dependence of\nresistivity, in the light of our derivation of Eq. (3.23). From this equation,\nresistivity of a material is given by\n21 m\nn eρσ τ= = (3.27)\nr thus depends inversely both on the number n of free electrons per unit\nvolume and on the average time t between collisions. As we increase\ntemperature, average speed of the electrons, which act as the carriers of\ncurrent, increases resulting in more frequent collisions. The average time\nof collisions t, thus decreases with temperature.\nIn a metal, n is not dependent on temperature to any appreciable\nextent and thus the decrease in the value of t with rise in temperature\ncauses r to increase as we have observed.\nFor insulators and semiconductors, however , n incr eases with\ntemperature. This increase more than compensates any decrease in t in\nEq.(3.23) so that for such materials, r decreases with temperature.\nExample 3.3  An electric toaster uses nichrome for its heating\nelement. When a negligibly small current passes through it, its\nresistance at r oom temperatur e (27.0 °C) is found to be 75.3 W. When\nthe toaster is connected to a 230 V supply, the current settles, after\na few seconds, to a steady value of 2.68 A. What is the steady\ntemperature of the nichrome element? The temperature coefficient\nof resistance of nichrome averaged over the temperature range\ninvolved, is 1.70 × 10–4 °C–1.\nSolution   When the current through the element is very small, heating\neffects can be ignored and the temperature T1 of the element is the\nsame as room temperature. When the toaster is connected to the\nsupply, its initial current will be slightly higher than its steady value\nof 2.68 A. But due to heating effect of the current, the temperature\nwill rise. This will cause an increase in resistance and a slight\ndecrease in current. In a few seconds, a steady state will be reached\nwhen temperatur e will rise no further , and both the r esistance of the\nelement and the current drawn will achieve steady values. The\nresistance R2 at the steady temperature T2 is\nR2 230 V85.82.68 A= = Ω\nUsing the relation\nR2 = R1 [1 + a (T2 – T1)]\nwith a = 1.70 × 10–4 °C–1, we get\nT2 – T1 –4(85.8 – 75.3)\n(75.3) 1.70 10=× ×  = 820 °C\nthat is,  T2 = (820 + 27.0) °C = 847 °C\nThus, the steady temperature of the heating element (when heating\neffect due to the current equals heat loss to the surroundings) is\n847 °C.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPhysics\n92\n EXAMPLE  3.4Example 3.4 The resistance of the platinum wire of a platinum\nresistance thermometer at the ice point is 5 W and at steam point is\n5.23 W. When the thermometer is inserted in a hot bath, the resistance\nof the platinum wir e is 5.795 W. Calculate the temperatur e of the\nbath.\nSolution R0 = 5 W, R100 = 5.23 W and Rt = 5.795 W\nNow,0\n0\n100 0100, (1 )t\ntR Rt R R tR Rα−= × = +−\n5.795 51005.23 5−= ×−\n=0.7951000.23×  = 345.65 °C\n3.9  ELECTRICAL  ENERGY , POWER\nConsider a conductor with end points A and B, in which a current I is\nflowing from A to B. The electric potential at A and B are denoted by V(A)\nand V(B) respectively. Since current is flowing from A to B, V(A) > V(B)\nand the potential difference across  AB is V = V(A) – V(B) > 0.\nIn a time interval Dt, an amount of charge DQ = I Dt travels from A to\nB. The potential energy of the charge at A, by definition, was Q V(A) and\nsimilarly at B, it is Q V(B). Thus, change in its potential energy DUpot is\nDUpot = Final potential energy – Initial potential energy\n         = DQ[(V (B) – V (A)] = – DQ V\n         = – I VDt < 0 (3.28)\nIf char ges moved without collisions thr ough the conductor , their\nkinetic energy would also change so that the total energy is unchanged.\nConservation of total energy would then imply that,\nDK =  – D\nUpot(3.29)\nthat is,\nDK = I VDt > 0 (3.30)\nThus, in case charges were moving freely through the conductor under\nthe action of electric field, their kinetic energy would increase as they\nmove. W e have, however , seen earlier that on the average, char ge carriers\ndo not move with acceleration but with a steady drift velocity. This is\nbecause of the collisions with ions and atoms during transit. During\ncollisions, the energy gained by the charges thus is shared with the atoms.\nThe atoms vibrate more vigorously, i.e., the conductor heats up. Thus,\nin an actual conductor , an amount of ener gy dissipated as heat in the\nconductor during the time interval Dt is,\nDW = I VDt (3.31)\nThe energy dissipated per unit time is the power dissipated\nP = DW/Dt  and we have,\nP = I V (3.32)\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCurrent\nElectricity\n93Using Ohm’s law V = IR , we get\nP = I 2 R = V 2/R (3.33)\nas the power loss (“ohmic loss”) in a conductor of resistance R carrying a\ncurrent I. It is this power which heats up, for example, the coil of an\nelectric bulb to incandescence, radiating out heat and light.\nWhere does the power come from? As we have\nreasoned before, we need an external source to keep\na steady curr ent thr ough the conductor . It is clearly\nthis sour ce which must supply this power . In the\nsimple circuit shown with a cell (Fig.3.11), it is the\nchemical energy of the cell which supplies this power\nfor as long as it can.\nThe expr essions for power , Eqs. (3.32) and (3.33),\nshow the dependence of the power dissipated in a\nresistor R on the current through it and the voltage\nacross it.\nEquation (3.33) has an important application to\npower transmission. Electrical power is transmitted\nfrom power stations to homes and factories, which\nmay be hundreds of miles away, via transmission\ncables. One obviously wants to minimise the power\nloss in the transmission cables connecting the power stations to homes\nand factories. W e shall  see now how this can be achieved. Consider a\ndevice R, to which a power P is to be delivered via transmission cables\nhaving a resistance Rc to be dissipated by it finally. If V is the voltage\nacross R and I the current through it, then\nP = V I (3.34)\nThe connecting wires from the power station to the device has a finite\nresistance Rc. The power dissipated in the connecting wires, which is\nwasted is Pc  with\nPc = I2 Rc\n   2\n2cP R\nV= (3.35)\nfrom Eq. (3.32). Thus, to drive a device of power P, the power wasted in the\nconnecting wires is inversely proportional to V 2. The  transmission cables\nfrom power stations are hundreds of miles long and their resistance Rc is\nconsiderable. To reduce Pc, these wires carry current at enormous values\nof V and this is the reason for the high voltage danger signs on transmission\nlines — a common sight as we move away from populated areas. Using\nelectricity at such voltages is not safe and hence at the other end, a device\ncalled a transformer lowers the voltage to a value suitable for use.\n3.10 C ELLS, EMF, INTERNAL  RESIST ANCE\nWe have alr eady mentioned that a simple device to maintain a steady\ncurrent in an electric circuit is the electrolytic cell. Basically a cell has\ntwo electrodes, called the positive (P) and the negative (N), as shown inFIGURE  3.11  Heat is produced in the\nresistor R which is connected across\nthe terminals of a cell. The energy\ndissipated in the resistor R comes from\nthe chemical energy of the electrolyte.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPhysics\n94Fig. 3.12. They are immersed in an electrolytic solution. Dipped in\nthe solution, the electrodes exchange charges with the electrolyte.\nThe positive electrode has a potential difference V+ (V+ > 0) between\nitself and the electrolyte solution immediately adjacent to it marked\nA in the figure. Similarly, the negative electrode develops a negative\npotential  – ( V– ) (V– ≥ 0) relative to the electrolyte adjacent to it,\nmarked as B in the figure. When there is no current, the electrolyte\nhas the same potential throughout, so that the potential difference\nbetween P and N is V+ – (–V–) = V+ + V– . This difference is called the\nelectromotive force  (emf) of the cell and is denoted by e. Thus\ne = V++V– >  0 (3.36)\nNote that e is, actually, a potential difference and not a force . The\nname emf, however , is used because of historical r easons, and was\ngiven at a time when the phenomenon was not understood properly.\nTo understand the significance of e, consider a resistor R\nconnected across the cell (Fig. 3.12). A current I flows across R\nfrom C to D. As explained before, a steady current is maintained\nbecause current flows from N to P through the electrolyte. Clearly,\nacross the electrolyte the same current flows through the electrolyte\nbut fr om N to P , wher eas thr ough R, it flows fr om P to N.\nThe electrolyte through which a current flows has a finite\nresistance r, called the inter nal r esistance . Consider first the\nsituation when R is infinite so that I = V/R = 0, where V is the\npotential difference between P and N. Now,\nV = Potential difference between P and A\n       + Potential difference between A and B\n       + Potential  difference between B and N\n   = e (3.37)\nThus, emf e is the potential difference between the positive and\nnegative electrodes in an open circuit, i.e., when no current is\nflowing through the cell.\nIf however R is finite, I is not zero. In that case the potential difference\nbetween P and N is\nV = V++ V– – I r\n   = e – I r (3.38)\nNote the negative sign in the expression ( I r) for the potential difference\nbetween A and B. This is because the current I flows from B to A in the\nelectrolyte.\nIn  practical calculations, internal resistances of cells in the circuit\nmay be neglected when the  curr ent I is such that e >> I r. The actual\nvalues of the internal resistances of cells vary from cell to cell. The internal\nresistance of dry cells, however , is much higher than the common\nelectrolytic cells.\nWe also observe that since V is the potential dif ference acr oss R, we\nhave from Ohm’s law\nV = I  R (3.39)\nCombining Eqs. (3.38) and (3.39), we getFIGURE  3.12  (a) Sketch of\nan electrolyte cell with\npositive terminal P and\nnegative terminal N. The\ngap between the electrodes\nis exaggerated for clarity.

However , in most cells the maximum allowed current\nis much lower than this to prevent permanent damage to the cell.\n3.11  3.11  3.11  3.11  3.11  C CC CCELLS ELLSELLS ELLSELLS     IN ININ ININ S  S S S SERIES ERIESERIES ERIESERIES     AND ANDAND ANDAND     IN ININ ININ P  P P P PARALLEL ARALLELARALLEL ARALLELARALLEL\nLike resistors, cells can be combined together in an electric circuit. And\nlike resistors, one can, for calculating currents and voltages in a circuit,\nreplace a combination of cells by an equivalent cell.\nFIGURE FIGUREFIGURE FIGUREFIGURE  3.13  3.13 3.13  3.13 3.13  Two cells of emf’s e1 and e2 in the series. r1, r2 are their\ninternal resistances.

Then V (A) – V (B) is the potential difference between the positive\nand negative terminals of the first cell. W e have already calculated it in\nEq.

If instead we connect the two negatives,\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPhysics\n96Eq. (3.42) would change to VBC = –e2–Ir2 and we will get\neeq = e1 – e2         ( e1 > e2) (3.47)\nThe rule for series combination clearly can be extended to any number\nof cells:\n(i)The equivalent emf of a series combination of n cells is just the sum of\ntheir individual emf’s, and\n(ii)The equivalent internal resistance of a series combination of n cells is\njust the sum of their internal resistances.\nThis is so, when the current leaves each cell from the positive\nelectrode. If in the combination, the current leaves any cell from\nthe negative electrode, the emf of the cell enters the expression\nfor eeq with a negative sign, as in Eq. (3.47).\nNext, consider a parallel combination of the cells (Fig. 3.14).\nI1 and I2 are the currents leaving the positive electrodes of the\ncells. At the point B1, I1 and I2 flow in whereas the current I flows\nout. Since as much charge flows in as out, we have\nI = I1 + I2(3.48)\nLet V (B1) and V (B2) be the potentials at B1 and B2, respectively.\nThen, considering the first cell, the potential difference across its\nterminals is V (B1) – V (B2).

Two rules, called Kirchhoff’s rules ,\nare very useful for analysis of electric circuits.\nGiven a circuit, we start by labelling currents in each resistor by a\nsymbol, say I, and a directed arrow to indicate that a current I flows\nalong the resistor in the direction indicated. If ultimately I is determined\nto be positive, the actual current in the resistor is in the direction of the\narrow. If I turns out to be negative, the current actually flows in a direction\nopposite to the arrow. Similarly, for each source (i.e., cell or some other\nsource of electrical power) the positive and negative electrodes are labelled,\nas well as, a directed arrow with a symbol for the current flowing through\nthe cell. This will tell us the potential difference, V = V (P) – V (N) = e – I r\n[Eq. (3.38) between the positive terminal P and the negative terminal N; I\nhere is the current flowing from N to P through the cell]. If, while labelling\nthe current I through the cell one goes from P to N, then of course\nV = e + I r (3.60)\nHaving clarified labelling, we now state the rules and the proof:\n(a) Junction rule:  At any junction, the sum of the currents entering\nthe junction is equal to the sum of currents leaving the junction\n(Fig. 3.15).Gustav Robert  Kirchhoff\n(1824 – 1887)  German\nphysicist, professor at\nHeidelberg and at\nBerlin. Mainly known for\nhis development of\nspectroscopy, he also\nmade many important\ncontributions to mathe-\nmatical physics, among\nthem, his first and\nsecond rules for circuits.\nGUST AV ROBER T KIRCHHOFF (1824 –\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPhysics\n98\n EXAMPLE  3.5This applies equally well if instead of a junction of\nseveral lines, we consider a point in a line.\nThe proof of this rule follows from the fact that\nwhen currents are steady, there is no accumulation\nof charges at any junction or at any point in a line.\nThus, the total current flowing in, (which is the rate\nat which charge flows into the junction), must equal\nthe total current flowing out.\n(b) Loop rule:  The algebraic sum of changes in\npotential around any closed loop involving\nresistors and cells in the loop is zero\n(Fig. 3.15).\nThis rule is also obvious, since electric potential is\ndependent on the location of the point. Thus\nstarting with any point if we come back to the same\npoint, the total change must be zero. In a closed\nloop, we do come back to the starting point and\nhence the rule.FIGURE  3.15  At junction a the current\nleaving is I1 + I2 and current entering is I3.\nThe junction rule says I3 = I1 + I2. At point\nh current entering is I1. There is only one\ncurrent leaving h and by junction rule\nthat will also be I1. For the loops ‘ahdcba’\nand ‘ahdefga’, the loop rules give –30 I1 –\n41 I3 + 45 = 0 and –30 I1 + 21 I2 – 80 = 0.\nExample 3.5  A battery of 10 V and negligible internal resistance is\nconnected across the diagonally opposite corners of a cubical network\nconsisting of 12 resistors each of resistance 1 W (Fig. 3.16). Determine\nthe equivalent resistance of the network and the current along each\nedge of the cube.\nZ\nFIGURE  3.16\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCurrent\nElectricity\n99\n EXAMPLE  3.5Similation for application of Kirchhoff ’s rules:\nhttp://www.phys.hawaii.edu/~teb/optics/java/kirch3/\n EXAMPLE  3.6Solution   The network is not reducible to a simple series and parallel\ncombinations of r esistors. Ther e is, however , a clear symmetry in the\nproblem which we can exploit to obtain the equivalent resistance of\nthe network.\nThe paths AA ¢, AD and AB are obviously symmetrically placed in the\nnetwork. Thus, the curr ent in each must be the same, say, I. Further ,\nat the corners A ¢, B and D, the incoming current I must split equally\ninto the two outgoing branches. In this manner , the curr ent in all\nthe 12 edges of the cube are easily written down in terms of I, using\nKirchhoff’s first rule and the symmetry in the problem.\nNext take a closed loop, say, ABCC ¢EA, and apply Kirchhoff’s second\nrule:\n–IR – (1/2) IR – IR + e = 0\nwhere R is the resistance of each edge and e the emf of battery. Thus,\ne = 5\n2I R\nThe equivalent resistance Req of the network is\n5\n3 6eqR RIε= =\nFor R = 1 W, Req = (5/6)  W and for e = 10 V, the total current (= 3 I) in\nthe network is\n3I = 10 V/(5/6)  W = 12 A, i.e., I = 4 A\nThe current flowing in each edge can now be read off from the\nFig. 3.16.\nIt should be noted that because of the symmetry of the network, the\ngreat power of Kirchhoff’s rules has not been very apparent in Example 3. 5.\nIn a general network, there will be no such simplification due to symmetry,\nand only by application of Kirchhoff’s rules to junctions and closed loops\n(as many as necessary to solve the unknowns in the network) can we\nhandle the problem. This will be illustrated in Example 3.6.\nExample 3.6  Determine the current in each branch of the network\nshown in Fig. 3.17.\nFIGURE  3.17\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPhysics\n100\n EXAMPLE  3.6Solution   Each branch of the network is assigned an unknown current\nto be determined by the application of Kirchhoff’s rules. To reduce\nthe number of unknowns at the outset, the first rule of Kirchhoff is\nused at every junction to assign the unknown current in each branch.\nWe then have thr ee unknowns I1, I2 and I3 which can be found by\napplying the second rule of Kirchhoff to three different closed loops.\nKirchhoff’s second rule for the closed loop ADCA gives,\n10 – 4( I1– I2) + 2( I2 + I3 – I1) – I1 = 0 [3.61(a)]\nthat is, 7 I1– 6I2 – 2I3 = 10\nFor the closed loop ABCA, we get\n10 – 4 I2– 2 (I2 + I3) – I1 = 0\nthat is, I1 + 6I2 + 2I3 =10 [3.61(b)]\nFor the closed loop BCDEB, we get\n5 – 2 ( I2 + I3) – 2 ( I2 + I3 – I1) = 0\nthat is, 2 I1 – 4I2 – 4I3 = –5 [3.61(c)]\nEquations (3.61 a, b, c) are three simultaneous equations in three\nunknowns. These can be solved by the usual method to give\nI1 = 2.5A,   I2 = 5\n8 A,   I3 = 718  A\nThe currents in the various branches of the network are\nAB : 5\n8 A,   CA : 122 A,   DEB : 718  A\nAD : 718 A,   CD : 0 A,   BC : 122 A\nIt is easily verified that Kirchhoff’s second rule applied to the\nremaining closed loops does not provide any additional independent\nequation, that is, the above values of currents satisfy the second\nrule for every closed loop of the network. For example, the total voltage\ndrop over the closed loop BADEB\n55\n8415\n84 V V V+ ×\n\n− ×\n\n\nequal to zero, as required by Kirchhoff’s second rule.\n3.13  W HEATSTONE  BRIDGE\nAs an application of Kirchhoff’s rules consider the circuit shown in\nFig. 3.18, which is called the Wheatstone bridge . The bridge has\nfour resistors R1, R2, R3 and R4. Across one pair of diagonally opposite\npoints (A and C in the figure) a source is connected. This ( i.e., AC) is\ncalled the battery arm. Between the other two vertices, B and D, a\ngalvanometer G (which is a device to detect currents) is connected. This\nline, shown as BD in the figure, is called the galvanometer arm.\nFor simplicity, we assume that the cell has no internal resistance. In\ngeneral there will be currents flowing across all the resistors as well as a\ncurrent Ig through G. Of special interest, is the case of a balanced  bridge\nwher e the r esistors ar e such that Ig = 0. W e can easily get the balance\ncondition, such that there is no current through G. In this case, the\nKirchhoff’s junction rule applied to junctions D and B (see the figure )\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCurrent\nElectricity\n101FIGURE  3.18\n EXAMPLE  3.7immediately gives us the relations I1 = I3 and I2 = I4. Next, we apply\nKirchhoff’s loop rule to closed loops ADBA  and CBDC. The first\nloop gives\n–I1 R1 + 0 + I2 R2 = 0        ( Ig = 0)   (3.62)\nand the second loop gives, upon using I3 = I1, I4 = I2\nI2 R4 + 0 – I1 R3 = 0         (3.63)\nFrom Eq. (3.62), we obtain,\n1 2\n2 1I R\nI R=\nwhereas from Eq.

Let us suppose we\nhave an unknown resistance, which we insert in the fourth arm; R4 is\nthus not known. Keeping known resistances R1 and R2 in the first and\nsecond arm of the bridge, we go on varying R3 till the galvanometer shows\na null deflection. The bridge then is balanced, and from the balance\ncondition the value of the unknown resistance R4 is given by,\n2\n4 3\n1RR RR= [3.64(b)]\nA practical device using this principle is called the meter bridge .\nExample 3.7  The four arms of a Wheatstone bridge (Fig. 3.19) have\nthe following resistances:\nAB = 100 W, BC = 10 W, CD = 5W, and DA = 60 W.\nFIGURE  3.19\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPhysics\n102\n EXAMPLE  3.7 A galvanometer of 15 W resistance is connected across BD. Calculate\nthe current through the galvanometer when a potential difference of\n10 V is maintained across AC.\nSolution   Considering the mesh BADB, we have\n100I1 + 15 Ig – 60 I2 = 0\nor   20 I1 + 3Ig – 12 I2= 0 [3.65(a)]\nConsidering the mesh BCDB, we have\n10 (I1 – Ig) – 15 Ig – 5 ( I2 + Ig) = 0\n10I1 – 30 Ig –5I2 = 0\n2I1 – 6Ig – I2 = 0 [3.65(b)]\nConsidering the mesh ADCEA,\n60I2 + 5 ( I2 + Ig) = 10\n65I2 + 5Ig = 10\n13I2 + Ig = 2 [3.65(c)]\nMultiplying Eq. (3.65b) by 10\n20I1 – 60 Ig – 10 I2 = 0 [3.65(d)]\nFrom Eqs. (3.65d) and (3.65a) we have\n63Ig – 2I2 = 0\nI2 = 31.5 Ig[3.65(e)]\nSubstituting the value of I2 into Eq. [3.65(c)], we get\n13 (31.5 Ig ) + Ig = 2\n410.5 Ig = 2\nIg = 4.87 mA.\nSUMMARY\n1.Current  through a given area of a conductor is the net charge passing\nper unit time through the area.\n2.To maintain a steady current, we must have a closed circuit in which\nan external agency moves electric charge from lower to higher potential\nenergy. The work done per unit charge by the source in taking the\ncharge from lower to higher potential energy (i.e., from one terminal\nof the source to the other) is called the electromotive force, or emf, of\nthe source. Note that the emf is not a force; it is the voltage difference\nbetween the two terminals of a source in open circuit.\n3.Ohm’s law : The electric current I flowing through a substance is\nproportional to the voltage V across its ends, i.e., V µ I or V = RI,\nwhere R is called the resistance  of the substance. The unit of resistance\nis ohm: 1 W = 1 V A–1.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCurrent\nElectricity\n1034.The resistance  R of a conductor depends on its length l and\ncross-sectional area A through the relation,\nlRAρ=\nwher e r, called resistivity  is a pr operty of the material and depends on\ntemperature and pressure.\n5.Electrical resistivity  of substances varies over a very wide range. Metals\nhave low resistivity, in the range of 10–8 W m to 10–6 W m. Insulators\nlike glass and rubber have 1022 to 1024 times greater resistivity.\nSemiconductors like Si and Ge lie roughly in the middle range of\nresistivity on a logarithmic scale.\n6.In most substances, the carriers of current are electrons; in some\ncases, for example, ionic crystals and electrolytic liquids, positive and\nnegative ions carry the electric current.\n7.Current density  j gives the amount of charge flowing per second per\nunit area normal to the flow,\nj = nq vd\nwhere n is the number density (number per unit volume) of charge\ncarriers each of charge q, and vd is the drift velocity  of the charge\ncarriers. For electrons  q = – e. If j is normal to a cross-sectional area\nA and is constant over the area, the magnitude of the current I through\nthe area is nevd A.\n8.Using E = V/l, I = nevd A, and Ohm’s law, one obtains\n2\ndeE nevm mρ=\nThe proportionality between the force eE  on the electrons in a metal\ndue to the external field E and the drift velocity vd (not acceleration)\ncan be understood, if we assume that the electrons suffer collisions\nwith ions in the metal, which deflect them randomly. If such collisions\noccur on an average at a time interval t,\nvd = at = eE t/m\nwhere a is the acceleration of the electron. This gives\n2m\nneρτ=\n9.In the temperature range in which resistivity increases linearly with\ntemperature, the temperature coefficient of resistivity  a is defined as\nthe fractional increase in resistivity per unit increase in temperature.\n10.Ohm’s law is obeyed by many substances, but it is not a fundamental\nlaw of nature. It fails if\n(a)V depends on I non-linearly.\n(b)the relation between V and I depends on the sign of V for the same\nabsolute value of V.\n(c)The relation between V and I is non-unique.\nAn example of (a) is when r increases with I (even if temperature is\nkept fixed). A rectifier combines features (a) and (b). GaAs shows the\nfeature (c).\n11.When a source of emf e is connected to an external resistance R, the\nvoltage Vext across R is given by\nVext = IR = RR rε\n+\nwhere r is the internal resistance  of the source.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPhysics\n104Physical Quantity Symbol Dimensions Unit Remark\nElectric current I [A] A SI base unit\nCharge Q, q [T A] C\nVoltage, Electric V [M L2 T–3 A–1] V Work/char ge\npotential difference\nElectromotive force e [M L2 T–3 A–1] V Work/char ge\nResistance R [M L2 T–3 A–2] W R = V /I\nResistivity r [M L3 T–3 A–2] W m R = rl/A\nElectrical s [M–1 L–3 T3 A2] S s = 1/ r\nconductivity\nElectric field E [M L T–3 A–1] V m–1 Electric force\ncharge\nDrift speed vd[L T–1] m s–1vde E\nm=τ\nRelaxation time t [T] s\nCurrent density j [L–2 A] A m–2current/area\nMobility m [M L3 T–4 A–1]m2 V–1s–1/dv E12.Kirchhoff’s Rules –\n(a)Junction Rule: At any junction of circuit elements, the sum of\ncurrents entering the junction must equal the sum of currents\nleaving it.\n(b)Loop Rule:  The algebraic sum of changes in potential around any\nclosed loop must be zero.\n13.The Wheatstone bridge  is an arrangement of four resistances – R1, R2,\nR3, R4 as shown in the text. The null-point condition is given by\n3 1\n2 4R R\nR R=\nusing which the value of one resistance can be determined, knowing\nthe other three resistances.\nPOINTS TO PONDER\n1.Current is a scalar although we represent current with an arrow.\nCurrents do not obey the  law of vector addition. That current is a\nscalar also follows from it’s  definition. The current I through an area\nof cross-section is given by the scalar product of two vectors:\nI =  j . DS\nwhere j and DS are vectors.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCurrent\nElectricity\n1052.Refer to V-I curves of a resistor and a diode as drawn in the text. A\nresistor obeys Ohm’s law while a diode does not. The assertion that\nV = IR is a statement of Ohm’s law is not true. This equation defines\nresistance and it may be applied to all conducting devices whether\nthey obey Ohm’s law or not. The Ohm’s law asserts that the plot of I\nversus V is linear i.e., R is independent of V.\nEquation E = ρ j leads to another statement of Ohm’s  law, i.e., a\nconducting material obeys Ohm’s law when the resistivity of the\nmaterial does not depend on the magnitude and direction of applied\nelectric field.\n3.Homogeneous conductors like silver or semiconductors like pure\ngermanium or germanium containing impurities obey Ohm’s law within\nsome range of electric field values. If the field becomes too strong,\nthere are departures from Ohm’s law in all cases.\n4.Motion of conduction electrons in electric field E is the sum of (i)\nmotion due to random collisions and (ii) that due to E. The motion\ndue to random collisions averages to zero and does not contribute to\nvd (Chapter 10, Textbook of Class XI). vd , thus is only due to applied\nelectric field on the electron.\n5.The relation j = ρ v should be applied to each type of charge carriers\nseparately. In a conducting wire, the total current and charge density\narises from both positive and negative charges:\nj = ρ+ v+ + ρ– v–\nρ ρρ ρρ = ρ+ + ρ–\nNow in a neutral wire carrying electric current,\nρ ρρ ρρ+ = – ρ–\nFurther, v+ ~ 0 which gives\nρ ρρ ρρ = 0\nj = ρ– v\nThus, the relation j = ρ v does not apply to the total current charge\ndensity.\n6.Kirchhoff’s junction rule is based on conservation of charge and the\noutgoing currents add up and are equal to incoming current at a\njunction. Bending or reorienting the wire does not change the validity\nof Kirchhoff’s junction rule.\nEXERCISES\n3.1 The storage battery of a car has an emf of 12 V.
