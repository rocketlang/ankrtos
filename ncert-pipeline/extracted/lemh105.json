Using the language of left and right hand limits, we\nmay say that the left (respectively right) hand limit of f at 0 is 1 (respectively 2). In\nparticular the left and right hand limits do not coincide. We also observe that the value\nof the function at x = 0 concides with the left hand limit. Note that when we try to draw\nthe graph, we cannot draw it in one stroke, i.e., without lifting pen from the plane of the\npaper , we can not draw the graph of this function. In fact, we need to lift the pen when\nwe come to 0 from left. This is one instance of function being not continuous at x = 0.\nNow , consider the function defined as\nf xx\nx( ),\n,=≠\n=\n\n1 0\n2 0if\nif\nThis function is also defined at every point. Left and the right hand limits at x = 0\nare both equal to 1. But the value of the\nfunction at x = 0 equals 2 which does not\ncoincide with the common value of the left\nand right hand limits. Again, we note that we\ncannot draw the graph of the function without\nlifting the pen. This is yet another instance of\na function being not continuous at x = 0.\nNaively , we may say that a function is\ncontinuous at a fixed point if we can draw the\ngraph of the function around that point without\nlifting the pen from the plane of the paper .\nMathematically , it may be phrased precisely as follows:\nDefinition 1 Suppose f is a real function on a subset of the real numbers and let  c be\na point in the domain of f. Then \nf is continuous at c if\nlim ( ) ( )\nx cf x f c\n→=\nMore elaborately , if the left hand limit, right hand limit and the value of the function\nat x = c exist and equal to each other , then f is said to be continuous at x = c. Recall that\nif the right hand and left hand limits at x = c coincide, then we say that the common\nvalue is the limit of the function at x = c. Hence we may also rephrase  the definition of\ncontinuity as follows: a function is continuous at x = c if the function is defined at\nx = c and if the value of the function at x = c equals the limit of the function at\nx = c. If f is not continuous at c, we say f is discontinuous at c and c is called a point\nof discontinuity of f.Fig 5.2\nReprint 2025-26\n\n MA THEMA TICS 106\nExample 1  Check the continuity of the function f given by f (x) = 2 x + 3 at x = 1.\nSolution\n First note that the function is defined at the given point x = 1 and its value is 5.\nThen find the limit of the function at x = 1. Clearly\n1 1lim ( ) lim (2 3) 2(1) 3 5\nx xf x x\n→ →= + = + =\nThus1lim ( ) 5 (1)\nxf x f\n→= =\nHence , f is continuous at x = 1.\nExample 2 Examine whether the function f given by f(x) = x2 is continuous at x = 0.\nSolution  First note that the function is defined at the given point x = 0 and its value is 0.\nThen find the limit of the function at x = 0. Clearly\n2 2\n0 0lim ( ) lim 0 0\nx xf x x\n→ →= = =\nThus0lim ( ) 0 (0)\nxf x f\n→= =\nHence , f is continuous at x = 0.\nExample 3 Discuss the continuity of the function f given by f(x) = | \nx | at x = 0.\nSolution  By definition\nf(x) =, if 0\n, if 0x x\nx x− <\n≥ \nClearly the function is defined at 0 and f(0) = 0. Left hand limit of f at 0 is\n0 0lim ( ) lim (– ) 0\nx xf x x\n− −→ →= =\nSimilarly , the right hand limit of f at 0 is\n0 0lim ( ) lim 0\nx xf x x\n+ +→ →= =\nThus, the left hand limit, right hand limit and the value of the function coincide at\nx = 0. Hence, f is continuous at x = 0.\nExample 4  Show that the function f given by\nf(x) =33, if 0\n1, if 0x x\nx+ ≠= \nis not continuous at x = 0.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCONTINUITY  AND DIFFERENTIABILITY 107\nSolution  The function is defined at x = 0 and its value at x = 0 is 1. When x ≠ 0, the\nfunction is given by a polynomial. Hence,\n0lim ( )\nxf x\n→ =3 3\n0lim ( 3) 0 3 3\nxx\n→+ = + =\nSince the limit of f at x = 0 does not coincide wit h f(0), the function is not continuous\nat x = 0. It may be noted that x = 0 is the only point of discontinuity for this function.\nExample 5  \nCheck the points where the constant function f(x) = k is continuous.\nSolution  The function is defined at all real numbers and by definition, its value at any\nreal number equals k. Let c  be any real number . Then\nlim ( )\nx cf x\n→ =lim\nx ck k\n→=\nSince f (c) = k = lim\nx c→ f(x) for any real number c, the function f is continuous at\nevery real number .\nExample 6  Prove that the identity function on real numbers given by f(x) = x  is\ncontinuous at every real number .\nSolution  The function is clearly defined at every point and f(c) = c for every real\nnumber c. Also,\nlim ( )\nx cf x\n→ =lim\nx cx c\n→=\nThus, lim\nx c→f(x) = c = f(c) and hence the function is continuous at every real number .\nHaving defined continuity of a function at a given point, now we make a natural\nextension of this definition to discuss continuity of a function.\nDefinition 2 A real function f is said to be continuous if it is continuous at every point\nin the domain of f.\nThis definition requires a bit of elaboration. Suppose f is a function defined on a\nclosed interval [ a, b], then for f to be continuous, it needs to be continuous at every\npoint in [\na, b] including the end points a and b. Continuity of f at a means\nlim ( )\nx af x\n+→=f(a)\nand continuity of f  at b means\n–lim ( )\nx bf x\n→=f(b)\nObserve that lim ( )\nx af x\n−→ and lim ( )\nx bf x\n+→do not make sense. As a consequence\nof this definition, if f is defined only at one point, it is continuous ther e, i.e., if the\ndomain of f is a singleton, f is a continuous function.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n MA THEMA TICS 108\nExample 7 Is the function defined by f(x) = | x |, a continuous function?\nSolution  We may rewrite f as\nf(x) =, if 0\n, if 0x x\nx x− <\n≥ \nBy Example 3, we know that f is continuous at x = 0.\nLet c be a real number such that c < 0. Then f(c) = – c. Also\nlim ( )\nx cf x\n→ =lim ( ) –\nx cx c\n→− =           (Why?)\nSince lim ( ) ( )\nx cf x f c\n→= ,  f  is continuous at all negative real numbers.\nNow , let c be a real number such that c > 0. Then f(c) = c . Also\nlim ( )\nx cf x\n→ =lim\nx cx c\n→=                 (Why?)\nSince lim ( ) ( )\nx cf x f c\n→= , f is continuous at all positive real numbers. Hence, f\nis continuous at all points.\nExample 8 Discuss the continuity of the function f given by \nf(x) = x3 + x2 – 1.\nSolution Clearly f is defined at every real number c and its value at c is c3 + c2 – 1. We\nalso know that\nlim ( )\nx cf x\n→ =3 2 3 2lim ( 1) 1\nx cx x c c\n→+ − = + −\nThus lim ( ) ( )\nx cf x f c\n→= , and hence f is continuous at every real number . This means\nf is a continuous function.\nExample 9 Discuss the continuity of the function f defined by f (x) = 1\nx, x ≠ 0.\nSolution  Fix any non zero real number c, we have\n1 1lim ( ) lim\nx c x cf xx c → →= =\nAlso, since for c ≠ 0, 1( )f cc=, we have lim ( ) ( )\nx cf x f c\n→=  and hence , f is continuous\nat every point in the domain of f. Thus f  is a continuous function.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCONTINUITY  AND DIFFERENTIABILITY 109\nWe take this opportunity to explain the concept of infinity . This we do by analysing\nthe function f(x) = 1\nx near x = 0. To carry out this analysis we follow the usual trick of\nfinding the value of the function at real numbers close to 0. Essentially we are trying to\nfind the right hand limit of f at 0. We tabulate this in the following (T able 5.1).\nTable 5.1\nx 1 0.3 0.2 0.1 = 10–10.01 = 10–20.001 = 10–310–n\nf(x)13.333... 5 10 100 = 1021000 = 10310n\nWe observe that as x gets closer to 0 from the right, the value of f(x) shoots up\nhigher . This may be rephrased as: the value of f(x) may be made lar ger than any given\nnumber by choosing a positive real number very close  to 0. In symbols, we write\n0lim ( )\nxf x\n+→= + ∞\n(to be read as: the right hand limit of f(x) at 0 is plus infinity). We wish to emphasise\nthat + ∞ is NOT a real number and hence the right hand limit of f at 0 does not exist (as\na real number).\nSimilarly , the left hand limit of f  at 0 may be found. The following table is self\nexplanatory .\nTable 5.2\nx – 1 – 0.3 – 0.2 – 10–1– 10–2– 10–3– 10–n\nf(x) – 1 – 3.333... – 5 – 10 – 102– 103– 10n\nFrom the Table 5.2, we deduce that the\nvalue of f(x) may be made smaller than any\ngiven number by choosing a negative real\nnumber very close  to 0. In symbols,\nwe write\n0lim ( )\nxf x\n−→= − ∞\n(to be read as: the left hand limit of f(x) at 0 is\nminus infinity). Again, we wish to emphasise\nthat – ∞ is NOT a real number and hence the\nleft hand limit of f at 0 does not exist (as a real\nnumber). The graph of the reciprocal function\ngiven in Fig 5.3 is a geometric representation\nof the above mentioned facts. Fig 5.3\nReprint 2025-26\n\n MA THEMA TICS 110\nExample 10  Discuss the continuity of the function f defined by\nf(x) =2, if 1\n2, if 1x x\nx x+ ≤\n− >\nSolution  The function f is defined at all points of the real line.\nCase 1  If c < 1, then f (c) = c + 2. Therefore, lim ( ) lim( 2) 2\nx c x cf x x c\n→ →= + = +\nThus , f is continuous at all real numbers less  than 1.\nCase 2  If c > 1, then f(c) = c – 2. Therefore,\nlim ( ) lim\nx c x cf x\n→ →= (x – 2) = c  – 2 = f (c)\nThus, f is continuous at all points x > 1.\nCase 3  If c = 1, then the left hand limit of f at\nx = 1 is\n– –1 1lim ( ) lim ( 2) 1 2 3\nx xf x x\n→ →= + = + =\nThe right hand limit of f at x = 1 is\n1 1lim ( ) lim ( 2) 1 2 1\nx xf x x\n+ +→ →= − = − = −\nSince the left and right hand limits of f at x = 1\ndo not coincide, f  is not continuous at x = 1. Hence\nx = 1 is the only point of discontinuity of f. The graph of the function is given in Fig 5.4.\nExample 1 1 Find all the points of discontinuity of the function f defined by\nf(x) = 2, if 1\n0, if 1\n2, if 1x x\nx\nx x+ <\n= \n− >\nSolution  As in the previous example we find that f\nis continuous at all real numbers x ≠ 1. The left\nhand limit of f at x = 1 is\n–1 1lim ( ) lim ( 2) 1 2 3\nx xf x x\n−→ →= + = + =\nThe right hand limit of f at x = 1 is\n1 1lim ( ) lim ( 2) 1 2 1\nx xf x x\n+ +→ →= − = − = −\nSince, the left and right hand limits of f at x = 1\ndo not coincide, f is not continuous at x = 1. Hence\nx = 1 is the only point of discontinuity of f. The\ngraph of the function is given in the Fig 5.5.Fig  5.4\nFig  5.5\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCONTINUITY  AND DIFFERENTIABILITY 111\nExample 12 Discuss the continuity of the function defined by\nf(x) =2, if 0\n2, if 0x x\nx x+ <\n− + >\nSolution  Observe that the function is defined at all real numbers except at 0. Domain\nof definition of this function is\nD1 ∪ D2 where  D1 = {x ∈ R : x < 0} and\n      D2 = {x ∈ R : x > 0}\nCase 1  If c ∈ D1, then lim ( ) lim\nx c x cf x\n→ →=  (x + 2)\n= c + 2 = f  (c) and hence f is continuous in D1.\nCase 2  If c ∈ D2, then lim ( ) lim\nx c x cf x\n→ →=  (– x  + 2)\n= – c  + 2 = f (c) and hence f is continuous in D2.\nSince f is continuous at all points in the domain of \nf,\nwe deduce that f is continuous. Graph of this\nfunction is given in the Fig 5.6. Note that to graph\nthis function we need to lift the pen from the plane\nof the paper , but we need to do that only for those points where the function is not\ndefined.\nExample 13  Discuss the continuity of the function f given by\nf(x) = 2, if 0\n, if 0x x\nx x≥ < \nSolution  Clearly the function is defined at\nevery real number . Graph of the function is\ngiven in Fig 5.7. By inspection, it seems prudent\nto partition the domain of definition of f into\nthree disjoint subsets of the real line.\nLet D1 = {x  ∈ R : x < 0}, D2 = {0} and\nD3 = {\nx ∈ R : x > 0}\nCase 1 At any point in D1, we have f(x) = x2 and it is easy to see that it is continuous\nthere (see Example 2).\nCase 2  At any point in D3, we have f(x) = x  and it is easy to see that it is continuous\nthere (see Example 6).Fig 5.6\n  Fig 5.7\nReprint 2025-26\n\n MA THEMA TICS 112\nCase 3  Now we analy se the function at x = 0. The value of the function at 0 is f(0) = 0.\nThe left hand limit of  f at 0 is\n–2 2\n0 0lim ( ) lim 0 0\nx xf x x\n−→ →= = =\nThe right hand limit of f at 0 is\n0 0lim ( ) lim 0\nx xf x x\n+ +→ →= =\nThus \n0lim ( ) 0\nxf x\n→== f(0) and hence f is continuous at 0. This means that f is\ncontinuous at every point in its domain and hence, f is a continuous function.\nExample 14 Show that every polynomial function is continuous.\nSolution  Recall that a function p is a polynomial function if it is defined by\np(x) = a0 + a1 x + ... + \nan xn for some natural number n, an ≠ 0 and ai ∈ R. Clearly this\nfunction is defined for every real number . For a fixed real number c, we have\nlim ( ) ( )\nx cp x p c\n→=\nBy definition, p is continuous at c. Since c  is any real number , p is continuous at\nevery real number and hence p is a continuous function.\nExample 15   Find all the points of discontinuity of the greatest integer function defined\nby f(x) = [x], where [ x] denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to x.\nSolution First observe that f is defined for all real numbers. Graph of the function is\ngiven in Fig 5.8. From the graph it looks like that f is discontinuous at every integral\npoint. Below we explore, if this is true.\nFig 5.8\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCONTINUITY  AND DIFFERENTIABILITY 113\nCase 1  Let c be a real number which is not equal to any integer . It is evident from the\ngraph that for all real numbers close  to c the value of the function is equal to [ c]; i.e.,\nlim ( ) lim [ ] [ ]\nx c x cf x x c\n→ →= = . Also f(c) = [c] and hence the function is continuous at all real\nnumbers not equal to integers.\nCase 2  Let c be an integer . Then we can find a suf ficiently small real number\nr > 0 such that  [c – r] = c – 1 whereas [ c + r] = c.\nThis, in terms of limits mean that\nlim\nx c−→f(x) = c – 1, lim\nx c+→f(x) = c\nSince these limits cannot be equal to each other for any c, the function is\ndiscontinuous at every integral point.\n5.2.1  Algebra of continuous functions\nIn the previous class, after having understood the concept of limits, we learnt some\nalgebra of limits. Analogously , now we will study some algebra of continuous functions.\nSince continuity of a function at a point is entirely dictated by the limit of the function at\nthat point, it is reasonable to expect results analogous to the case of limits.\nTheorem 1  Suppose f  and g be two real functions continuous at a real number c.\nThen\n(1) f + g is continuous at x = c.\n(2) f – g is continuous at x = c.\n(3) f . g is continuous at x = c.\n(4)f\ng \n   is continuous at x = c, (provided g(c) ≠ 0).\nProof We are investigating continuity of ( f + g) at x = c. Clearly it is defined at\nx = c. We have\nlim( )( )\nx cf g x\n→+  =lim [ ( ) ( )]\nx cf x g x\n→+ (by definition of f + g)\n=lim ( ) lim ( )\nx c x cf x g x\n→ →+ (by the theorem on limits)\n=f(c) + g(c) (as f and g are continuous)\n=(f + g) (c) (by definition of f + g)\nHence, \nf + g is continuous at x = c.\nProofs for the remaining parts are similar and left as an exercise to the reader .\nReprint 2025-26\n\n MA THEMA TICS 114\nRemarks\n(i)As a special case of (3) above, if f is a constant function, i.e., f(x) = λ for some\nreal number λ, then the function ( λ . g) defined by ( λ . g) (x) = λ . g(x) is also\ncontinuous. In particular if λ = – 1, the continuity of f implies continuity of – f.\n(ii) As a special case of (4) above, if f is the constant function f(x) = λ , then the\nfunction gλ defined by ( )( )xg g xλ λ= is also continuous wherever g(x) ≠ 0. In\nparticular , the continuity of g implies continuity of 1\ng.\nThe above theorem can be exploited to generate many continuous functions. They\nalso aid in deciding if certain functions are continuous or not. The following examples\nillustrate this:\nExample 16  Prove that every rational function is continuous.\nSolution  Recall that every rational function f is given by\n( )( ) , ( ) 0( )p xf x q xq x= ≠\nwhere p and q are polynomial functions. The domain of f is all real numbers except\npoints at which q  is zero. Since polynomial functions are continuous (Example 14), f is\ncontinuous by (4) of  Theorem 1.\nExample 17  Discuss the continuity of sine function.\nSolution  To see this we use the following facts\n0lim sin 0\nxx\n→=\nWe have not proved it, but is intuitively clear from the graph of sin x near 0.\nNow , observe that f(x) = sin x is defined for every real number . Let c be a real\nnumber . Put x = c + h. If x  → c we know that h → 0. Therefore\nlim ( )\nx cf x\n→ =lim sin\nx cx\n→\n=0lim sin( )\nhc h\n→+\n=0lim [sin cos cos sin ]\nhc h c h\n→+\n=0 0lim [sin cos ] lim [cos sin ]\nh hc h c h\n→ →+\n=sin c  + 0 = sin c  = f(c)\nThus lim\nx c→ f(x) = f(c) and hence f is a continuous function.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCONTINUITY  AND DIFFERENTIABILITY 115\nRemark  A similar proof may be given for the continuity of cosine function.\nExample 18  Prove that the function defined by f(x) = tan x  is a continuous function.\nSolution  The function f(x) = tan x = sin\ncosx\nx. This is defined for all real numbers such\nthat cos x ≠ 0, i.e., x ≠ (2n +1)2π. We have just proved that both sine and cosine\nfunctions are continuous. Thus tan x being a quotient of two continuous functions is\ncontinuous wherever it is defined.\nAn interesting fact is the behaviour of continuous functions with respect to\ncomposition of functions. Recall that if f and g are two real functions, then\n(f o g) (x) = f(g(x))\nis defined whenever the range of g is a subset of domain of f. The following theorem\n(stated without proof) captures the continuity of composite functions.\nTheorem 2  Suppose \nf and g are real valued functions such that ( f o g) is defined at c.\nIf g is continuous at c and if f  is continuous at g(c), then ( f o g) is continuous at c.\nThe following examples illustrate this theorem.\nExample 19 Show that the function defined by f(x) = sin (x2) is a continuous function.\nSolution  Observe that the function is defined for every real number . The function\nf may be thought of as a composition g o h of the two functions g and h, where\ng(x) = sin x  and h(x) = x2. Since both g and h  are continuous functions, by Theorem 2,\nit can be deduced that f is a continuous function.\nExample 20 Show that the function f defined by\nf(x) =|1 – x  + |x||,\nwhere x  is any real number , is a continuous function.\nSolution  Define g  by g (x) = 1 – x + |x| and  h by h(x) = |x| for all real x. Then\n(h o g) (x) =h(g(x))\n=h(1– x  + |x|)\n=|1– x + |x|| = f(x)\nIn Example 7, we have seen that h is a continuous function. Hence g being a sum\nof a polynomial function and the modulus function is continuous. But then f  being a\ncomposite of two continuous functions is continuous.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n MA THEMA TICS 116\nEXERCISE 5.1\n1.Prove that the function f(x) = 5x – 3 is continuous at x = 0, at x = – 3 and at x = 5.\n2.Examine the continuity of the function f(x) = 2x2 – 1 at x = 3.\n3.Examine the following functions for continuity .\n(a) f(x) = x – 5 (b) f(x) = 1\n5x−, x ≠ 5\n(c) f(x) = 225\n5x\nx−\n+, x ≠ –5 (d) f(x) = |x – 5|\n4.Prove that the function f(x) = xn is continuous at x = n, where n is a positive\ninteger .\n5.Is the function f defined by\n, if 1( )5, if > 1x xf xx≤ =\n\ncontinuous at x = 0?

Differentiability\nRecall the following facts from previous class. We had defined the derivative of a real\nfunction as follows:\nSuppose f  is a real function and c is a point in its domain. The derivative of f at c is\ndefined by\n0( ) ( )lim\nhf c h f c\nh →+ −\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCONTINUITY  AND DIFFERENTIABILITY 119\nf(x) xnsin x cos x tan x\nf′(x) nxn–1cos x – sin x sec2 xprovided this limit exists. Derivative of f at c is denoted by f′(c) or ( ( )) |cdf xdx. The\nfunction defined by\n0( ) ( )( ) lim\nhf x h f xf xh →+ −′=\nwherever the limit exists is defined to be the derivative of f. The derivative of f is\ndenoted by f′(x) or ( ( ))df xdxor if y = f(x) by dy\ndxor y′. The process of finding\nderivative of a function is called dif ferentiation. We also use the phrase differ entiate\nf(x) with r espect to x to mean find f′(x).\nThe following rules were established as a part of algebra of derivatives:\n(1) (u ± v)′ = u′ ± \nv′\n(2) (uv)′ = u′v + uv′ (Leibnitz or product rule)\n(3)\n2u u v uv\nv v′′ − ′  =   , wherever v ≠ 0 (Quotient rule).\nThe following table gives a list of derivatives of certain standard functions:\nTable 5.3\nWhenever we defined derivative, we had put a caution provided the limit exists .\nNow the natural question is; what if it doesn’t? The question is quite pertinent and so is\nits answer . If  \n0( ) ( )lim\nhf c h f c\nh →+ − does not exist , we say that f is not dif ferentiable at c.\nIn other words, we say that a function f  is differentiable at a point c in its domain if both\n–0( ) ( )lim\nhf c h f c\nh →+ − and \n0( ) ( )lim\nhf c h f c\nh+→+ − are finite and equal. A function is said\nto be dif ferentiable in an interval [ a, b] if it is dif ferentiable at every point of [ a, b]. As\nin case of continuity , at the end points a and b, we take the right hand limit and left hand\nlimit, which are nothing but left hand derivative and right hand derivative of the function\nat a and b respectively . Similarly , a function is said to be dif ferentiable in an interval\n(a, b) if it is differentiable at every point of ( a, b).\nReprint 2025-26\n\n MA THEMA TICS 120\nTheorem 3  If a function f is differentiable at a point c, then it is also continuous at that\npoint.\nProof  Since f is differentiable at c, we have\n( ) ( )lim ( )\nx cf x f cf cx c →−= ′−\nBut for x  ≠ c, we have\nf(x) – f(c) =( ) ( ). ( )f x f cx cx c−−−\nTherefore lim [ ( ) ( )]\nx cf x f c\n→−  =( ) ( )lim . ( )\nx cf x f cx cx c →−  − −  \nor lim [ ( )] lim [ ( )]\nx c x cf x f c\n→ →−  =( ) ( )lim . lim [( )]\nx c x cf x f cx cx c → →−  − −  \n=f′(c) . 0 = 0\nor lim ( )\nx cf x\n→ =f(c)\nHence f is continuous at x = c.\nCorollary 1  Every differentiable function is continuous.\nWe remark that the converse of the above statement is not true. Indeed we have\nseen that the function defined by f(x) = |x| is a continuous function. Consider the left\nhand limit\n–0(0 ) (\n0)lim 1\nhf h f h\nh h →+ − −= = −\nThe right hand limit\n0(0 ) (0)lim 1\nhf h f h\nh h+→+ −= =\nSince the above left and right hand limits at 0 are not equal, \n0(0 ) (0)lim\nhf h f\nh →+ −\ndoes not exist and hence f is not differentiable at 0. Thus f is not a differentiable\nfunction.\n5.3.1   Derivatives of composite functions\nTo study derivative of composite functions, we start with an illustrative example. Say ,\nwe want to find the derivative of f, where\nf(x) =(2x + 1)3\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCONTINUITY  AND DIFFERENTIABILITY 121\nOne way is to expand (2 x + 1)3 using binomial theorem and find the derivative as\na polynomial function as illustrated below .\n( )df xdx =3(2 1)dxdx  +  \n=3 2(8 12 6 1)dx x xdx+ + +\n=24x2 + 24 x + 6\n=6 (2x + 1)2\nNow , observe that f(x) =(h o g) (x)\nwhere g(x) = 2 x + 1 and h(x) = x3. Put \nt = g(x) = 2x  + 1. Then f( x) = h(t) = t3. Thus\ndf\ndx =6 (2x + 1)2 = 3(2x  + 1)2 . 2 = 3 t2 . 2 = dh dt\ndt dx⋅\nThe advantage with such observation is that it simplifies the calculation in finding\nthe derivative of, say , (2x + 1)100. We may formalise this observation in the following\ntheorem called the chain rule.\nTheorem 4  (Chain Rule) Let f be a real valued function which is a composite of two\nfunctions u and v; i.e., f = v o\n u. Suppose t = u(x) and if both dt\ndx and dv\ndt exist , we have\ndf dv dt\ndx dt dx= ⋅\nWe skip the proof of this theorem. Chain rule may be extended as follows. Suppose\nf is a real valued function which is a composite of three functions u, v and w ; i.e.,\nf = (w \no u) o v. If t = v( x) and s  = u(t), then\n( o ) df d w u dt dw ds dt\ndx dt dx ds dt dx= ⋅ = ⋅ ⋅\nprovided all the derivatives in the statement exist. Reader is invited to formulate chain\nrule for composite of more functions.\nExample 21 Find the derivative of the function given by f(x) = sin ( x2).\nSolution  Observe that the given function is a composite of two functions. Indeed, if\nt = u(x) = x2 and v(t) = sin \nt, then\nf(x) = (v o u) (x) = v(u(x)) = v (x2) = sin x2\nReprint 2025-26\n\n MA THEMA TICS 122\nPut t = u(x) = x2. Observe that cosdvtdt=  and 2dtxdx=  exist. Hence, by chain rule\ndf\ndx = cos 2dv dtt xdt dx⋅ = ⋅\nIt is normal practice to express the final result only in terms of x. Thus\ndf\ndx =2cos 2 2 cost x x x⋅ =\nEXERCISE 5.2\nDifferentiate the functions with respect to x in Exercises 1 to 8.\n1.sin (x2 + 5) 2.cos (sin x) 3.sin (ax + b)\n4.sec (tan ( x)) 5.sin ( )\ncos ( )ax b\ncx d+\n+6.cos x3 . sin2 (x5)\n7.

In this section, we shall\nlearn about a new class of (related) functions called exponential functions and logarithmic\nfunctions. It needs to be emphasized that many statements made in this section are\nmotivational and precise proofs of these are well beyond the scope of this text.\nThe Fig 5.9 gives a sketch of y = f1(x) = x, y = f2(x) = x2, y = f3(x) = x3 and y = f4(x)\n= x4. Observe that the curves get steeper as the power of x increases. Steeper the\ncurve, faster is the rate of growth. What this means is that for a fixed increment in the\nvalue of x(> 1), the increment in the value of y = fn (x) increases as n increases for n\n= 1, 2, 3, 4. It is conceivable that such a statement is true for all positive values of n,\nReprint 2025-26\n\n MA THEMA TICS 126\nwhere fn (x) = xn. Essentially , this means\nthat the graph of y  = fn (x) leans  more\ntowards the y-axis as n increases. For\nexample, consider f10(x) = x10 and \nf15(x)\n= x15. If x increases from 1 to 2, f10\nincreases from 1 to 210 whereas f15\nincreases from 1 to 215. Thus, for the same\nincrement in x, f15 grow faster than f10.\nUpshot of the above discussion is that\nthe growth of polynomial functions is\ndependent  on the degree of the polynomial\nfunction – higher the degree, greater is\nthe growth. The next natural question is:\nIs there a function which grows faster than any polynomial function. The answer is in\naffirmative and an example of such a function is\ny  = f(x) = 10x.\nOur claim is that this function f grows faster than fn (x) = xn for any positive integer n.\nFor example, we can prove that 10x grows faster than f100 (x) = x100. For large values\nof x like x  = 103, note that f100 (x) = (103)100 = 10300 whereas f(103) = 31010 = 101000.\nClearly f(x) is much greater than f100 (x). It is not difficult to prove that for all\nx > 103, f(x) > f100 (x). But we will not attempt to give a proof of this here. Similarly , by\nchoosing large values of x, one can verify that f(x) grows faster than fn (x) for any\npositive integer n.\nDefinition 3 The exponential function with positive base b > 1 is the function\ny = f(x) = bx\nThe graph of y = 10x is given in the Fig 5.9.\nIt is advised that the reader plots this graph for particular values of b like 2, 3 and 4.\nFollowing are some of the salient features of the exponential functions:\n(1) Domain of the exponential function is R, the set of all real numbers.\n(2) Range of the exponential function is the set of all positive real numbers.\n(3) The point (0, 1) is always on the graph of the exponential function (this is a\nrestatement of the fact that b0 = 1 for any real b > 1).\n(4) Exponential function is ever increasing; i.e., as we move from left to right, the\ngraph rises above.Fig  5.9\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCONTINUITY  AND DIFFERENTIABILITY 127\n(5) For very large negative values of x , the exponential function is very close to 0. In\nother words, in the second quadrant, the graph approaches x-axis (but never\nmeets it).\nExponential function with base 10 is called the common exponential function . In\nthe Appendix A.1.4 of Class XI, it was observed that the sum of the series\n1 11 ...1! 2!+ + +\nis a number between 2 and 3 and is denoted by e. Using this e as the base we obtain an\nextremely important exponential function y = ex.\nThis is called natural exponential function .\nIt would be interesting to know if the inverse of the exponential function exists and\nhas nice  interpretation. This search motivates the following definition.\nDefinition 4  Let b > 1 be a real number . Then we say logarithm of a to base b is x if\nbx = a.\nLogarithm of a to base b is denoted by logb a. Thus logb a = x if bx = \na.  Let us\nwork with a few explicit examples to get a feel for this. We know 23 = 8. In terms of\nlogarithms, we may rewrite this as log2 8 = 3. Similarly , 104 = 10000 is equivalent to\nsaying log10 10000 = 4. Also, 625 = 54 = 252 is equivalent to saying log5 625 = 4 or\nlog25 625 = 2.\nOn a slightly more mature note, fixing a  base b > 1, we may look at logarithm as\na function from positive real numbers to all real numbers. This function, called the\nlogarithmic function , is defined by\nlogb : R+ →R\nx →logb x = y   if by = x\nAs before if the base b = 10, we say it\nis common logarithms and if b  = e, then\nwe say it is natural logarithms . Often\nnatural logarithm is denoted by ln. In this\nchapter , log x  denotes the logarithm\nfunction to base e , i.e., ln x will be written\nas simpl y log x. The Fig 5.10 gives the plots\nof logarithm function to base 2, e and 10.\nSome of the important observations\nabout the logarithm function to any base\nb > 1 are listed below: Fig 5.10\nReprint 2025-26\n\n MA THEMA TICS 128\n Fig 5.1 1(1) We cannot make a meaningful definition of logarithm of non-positive numbers\nand hence the domain of log function is R+.\n(2) The range of log function is the set of all real numbers.\n(3) The point (1, 0) is always on the graph of the log function.\n(4) The log function is ever increasing,\ni.e., as we move from left to right\nthe graph rises above.\n(5) For x very near to zero, the value\nof log x can be made lesser than\nany given real number . In other\nwords in the fourth quadrant the\ngraph approaches y-axis (but\nnever meets it).\n(6) Fig 5.1 1 gives the plot of y = ex and\ny =\n ln x. It is of interest to observe\nthat the two curves are the mirror\nimages of each other reflected in the line y = x.\nTwo  properties of ‘log’  functions are proved below:\n(1) There is a standard change of base rule to obtain loga p in terms of logb p. Let\nloga p = α, logb p = β and logb a = γ. This means aα = p, bβ = p and bγ = a.\nSubstituting the third equation in the first one, we have\n(bγ)α =bγα = p\nUsing this in the second equation, we get\nbβ =p = bγα\nwhich implies β = αγ or α  =β\nγ. But then\nloga p =log\nlogb\nbp\na\n(2) Another interesting property of the log function is its effect on products. Let\nlogb pq = α. Then bα = pq. If logb p = β and logb q = γ, then bβ = p and bγ = q.\nBut then bα = \npq = bβbγ = bβ + γ\nwhich implies α = β + γ, i.e.,\nlogb pq =logb p + logb q\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCONTINUITY  AND DIFFERENTIABILITY 129\nA particularly interesting and important consequence of this is when p = q. In\nthis case the above may be rewritten as\nlogb p2 = logb p + logb p = 2 log p\nAn easy generalisation of this (left as an exercise!) is\nlogb pn =n log p\nfor any positive integer n. In fact this is true for any real number n, but we will\nnot attempt to prove this. On the similar lines the reader is invited to verify\nlogbx\ny =logb x – logb y\nExample 25 Is it true that x = elog x for all real x?\nSolution First, observe that the domain of log function is set of all positive real numbers.\nSo the above equation is not true for non-positive real numbers. Now , let y = elog x. If\ny > 0, we may take logarithm which gives us log y = log ( elog x) = log x . log e = log x. Thus\ny = x. Hence x = elog x is true only for positive values of x.\nOne of the striking properties of the natural exponential function in differential\ncalculus is that it doesn’t change during the process of differentiation. This is captured\nin the following theorem whose proof we skip.\nTheorem 5*\n(1) The derivative of ex w.r.t., x is ex; i.e., d\ndx(ex) = ex.\n(2) The derivative of log x w.r.t., x is 1\nx; i.e., d\ndx(log x) = 1\nx.\nExample 26 Dif ferentiate the following w .r.t. x:\n(i)e–x(ii)   sin (log x), x > 0     (iii)   cos–1 (ex)  (iv)    \necos x\nSolution\n(i)Let y = e–x.

Logarithmic Differentiation\nIn this section, we will learn to differentiate certain special class of functions given in\nthe form\ny =f(x) = [ u(x)]v (x)\nBy taking logarithm (to base e) the above may be rewritten as\nlog y =v(x) log [ u(x)]\nUsing chain rule we may differentiate this to get\n1 1( )( )dyv xy dx u x⋅ = ⋅  . u′(x) + v′(x) . log [ u(x)]\nwhich implies that\n[ ]( )( ) ( ) log ( )( )dy v xy u x v x u xdx u x = ⋅ ′ + ′ ⋅  \nThe main point to be noted in this method is that f(x) and u(x) must always be\npositive as otherwise their logarithms are not defined. This process of differentiation is\nknown as logarithms differ entiation and is illustrated by the following examples:\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCONTINUITY  AND DIFFERENTIABILITY 131\nExample 27 Dif ferentiate 2\n2( 3) ( 4)\n3 4 5x x\nx x− +\n+ + w.r.t. x.\nSolution  Let 2\n2( 3) ( 4)\n(3 4 5)x xy\nx x− +=\n+ +\nTaking logarithm on both sides, we have\nlog y =1\n2[log ( x – 3) + log (x2 + 4) – log (3 x2 + 4x + 5)]\nNow , differentiating both sides w .r.t. \nx, we get\n1dy\ny dx⋅ = 2 21 1 2 6 4\n2 ( 3) 4 3 4 5x x\nx x x x+  + − − + + +  \nordy\ndx = 2 21 2 6 4\n2 ( 3) 4 3 4 5y x x\nx x x x+  + − − + + +  \n=2\n2 2 21 ( 3)( 4) 1 2 6 4\n2 ( 3) 3 4 5 4 3 4 5x x x x\nx x x x x x− + +  + − − + + + + +  \nExample 28 Dif ferentiate ax w.r.t. x, where a is a positive constant.\nSolution  Let y = ax.

Differentiability\nRecall the following facts from previous class. We had defined the derivative of a real\nfunction as follows:\nSuppose f  is a real function and c is a point in its domain. The derivative of f at c is\ndefined by\n0( ) ( )lim\nhf c h f c\nh →+ −\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCONTINUITY  AND DIFFERENTIABILITY 119\nf(x) xnsin x cos x tan x\nf′(x) nxn–1cos x – sin x sec2 xprovided this limit exists. Derivative of f at c is denoted by f′(c) or ( ( )) |cdf xdx. The\nfunction defined by\n0( ) ( )( ) lim\nhf x h f xf xh →+ −′=\nwherever the limit exists is defined to be the derivative of f. The derivative of f is\ndenoted by f′(x) or ( ( ))df xdxor if y = f(x) by dy\ndxor y′. The process of finding\nderivative of a function is called dif ferentiation. We also use the phrase differ entiate\nf(x) with r espect to x to mean find f′(x).\nThe following rules were established as a part of algebra of derivatives:\n(1) (u ± v)′ = u′ ± \nv′\n(2) (uv)′ = u′v + uv′ (Leibnitz or product rule)\n(3)\n2u u v uv\nv v′′ − ′  =   , wherever v ≠ 0 (Quotient rule).\nThe following table gives a list of derivatives of certain standard functions:\nTable 5.3\nWhenever we defined derivative, we had put a caution provided the limit exists .\nNow the natural question is; what if it doesn’t? The question is quite pertinent and so is\nits answer . If  \n0( ) ( )lim\nhf c h f c\nh →+ − does not exist , we say that f is not dif ferentiable at c.\nIn other words, we say that a function f  is differentiable at a point c in its domain if both\n–0( ) ( )lim\nhf c h f c\nh →+ − and \n0( ) ( )lim\nhf c h f c\nh+→+ − are finite and equal. A function is said\nto be dif ferentiable in an interval [ a, b] if it is dif ferentiable at every point of [ a, b]. As\nin case of continuity , at the end points a and b, we take the right hand limit and left hand\nlimit, which are nothing but left hand derivative and right hand derivative of the function\nat a and b respectively . Similarly , a function is said to be dif ferentiable in an interval\n(a, b) if it is differentiable at every point of ( a, b).\nReprint 2025-26\n\n MA THEMA TICS 120\nTheorem 3  If a function f is differentiable at a point c, then it is also continuous at that\npoint.\nProof  Since f is differentiable at c, we have\n( ) ( )lim ( )\nx cf x f cf cx c →−= ′−\nBut for x  ≠ c, we have\nf(x) – f(c) =( ) ( ). ( )f x f cx cx c−−−\nTherefore lim [ ( ) ( )]\nx cf x f c\n→−  =( ) ( )lim .

Indeed we have\nseen that the function defined by f(x) = |x| is a continuous function. Consider the left\nhand limit\n–0(0 ) (\n0)lim 1\nhf h f h\nh h →+ − −= = −\nThe right hand limit\n0(0 ) (0)lim 1\nhf h f h\nh h+→+ −= =\nSince the above left and right hand limits at 0 are not equal, \n0(0 ) (0)lim\nhf h f\nh →+ −\ndoes not exist and hence f is not differentiable at 0. Thus f is not a differentiable\nfunction.\n5.3.1   Derivatives of composite functions\nTo study derivative of composite functions, we start with an illustrative example. Say ,\nwe want to find the derivative of f, where\nf(x) =(2x + 1)3\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCONTINUITY  AND DIFFERENTIABILITY 121\nOne way is to expand (2 x + 1)3 using binomial theorem and find the derivative as\na polynomial function as illustrated below .\n( )df xdx =3(2 1)dxdx  +  \n=3 2(8 12 6 1)dx x xdx+ + +\n=24x2 + 24 x + 6\n=6 (2x + 1)2\nNow , observe that f(x) =(h o g) (x)\nwhere g(x) = 2 x + 1 and h(x) = x3. Put \nt = g(x) = 2x  + 1. Then f( x) = h(t) = t3. Thus\ndf\ndx =6 (2x + 1)2 = 3(2x  + 1)2 . 2 = 3 t2 . 2 = dh dt\ndt dx⋅\nThe advantage with such observation is that it simplifies the calculation in finding\nthe derivative of, say , (2x + 1)100. We may formalise this observation in the following\ntheorem called the chain rule.\nTheorem 4  (Chain Rule) Let f be a real valued function which is a composite of two\nfunctions u and v; i.e., f = v o\n u. Suppose t = u(x) and if both dt\ndx and dv\ndt exist , we have\ndf dv dt\ndx dt dx= ⋅\nWe skip the proof of this theorem. Chain rule may be extended as follows. Suppose\nf is a real valued function which is a composite of three functions u, v and w ; i.e.,\nf = (w \no u) o v. If t = v( x) and s  = u(t), then\n( o ) df d w u dt dw ds dt\ndx dt dx ds dt dx= ⋅ = ⋅ ⋅\nprovided all the derivatives in the statement exist. Reader is invited to formulate chain\nrule for composite of more functions.\nExample 21 Find the derivative of the function given by f(x) = sin ( x2).\nSolution  Observe that the given function is a composite of two functions. Indeed, if\nt = u(x) = x2 and v(t) = sin \nt, then\nf(x) = (v o u) (x) = v(u(x)) = v (x2) = sin x2\nReprint 2025-26\n\n MA THEMA TICS 122\nPut t = u(x) = x2.

For example,\nconsider one of the following relationships between x and y :\nx – y – π =0\nx + sin xy – y =0\nIn the first case, we can solve for y  and rewrite the relationship as y = x – π. In\nthe second case, it does not seem that there is an easy way to solve for y . Nevertheless,\nthere is no doubt about the dependence of y on x in either of the cases. When a\nrelationship between x \nand y is expressed in a way that it is easy to solve for y  and\nwrite y  = f(x), we say that y is given as an explicit function of x. In the latter case it\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCONTINUITY  AND DIFFERENTIABILITY 123\nis implicit that y is a function of x and we say that the relationship of the second type,\nabove, gives function implicitly .

Now we use chain rule to find derivatives of these functions.\nExample 24  Find the derivative of f given by f(x) = sin–1 x assuming it exists.\nSolution  Let y = sin–1 x.

In this section, we shall\nlearn about a new class of (related) functions called exponential functions and logarithmic\nfunctions. It needs to be emphasized that many statements made in this section are\nmotivational and precise proofs of these are well beyond the scope of this text.\nThe Fig 5.9 gives a sketch of y = f1(x) = x, y = f2(x) = x2, y = f3(x) = x3 and y = f4(x)\n= x4. Observe that the curves get steeper as the power of x increases. Steeper the\ncurve, faster is the rate of growth. What this means is that for a fixed increment in the\nvalue of x(> 1), the increment in the value of y = fn (x) increases as n increases for n\n= 1, 2, 3, 4. It is conceivable that such a statement is true for all positive values of n,\nReprint 2025-26\n\n MA THEMA TICS 126\nwhere fn (x) = xn. Essentially , this means\nthat the graph of y  = fn (x) leans  more\ntowards the y-axis as n increases. For\nexample, consider f10(x) = x10 and \nf15(x)\n= x15. If x increases from 1 to 2, f10\nincreases from 1 to 210 whereas f15\nincreases from 1 to 215. Thus, for the same\nincrement in x, f15 grow faster than f10.\nUpshot of the above discussion is that\nthe growth of polynomial functions is\ndependent  on the degree of the polynomial\nfunction – higher the degree, greater is\nthe growth. The next natural question is:\nIs there a function which grows faster than any polynomial function. The answer is in\naffirmative and an example of such a function is\ny  = f(x) = 10x.\nOur claim is that this function f grows faster than fn (x) = xn for any positive integer n.\nFor example, we can prove that 10x grows faster than f100 (x) = x100. For large values\nof x like x  = 103, note that f100 (x) = (103)100 = 10300 whereas f(103) = 31010 = 101000.\nClearly f(x) is much greater than f100 (x). It is not difficult to prove that for all\nx > 103, f(x) > f100 (x). But we will not attempt to give a proof of this here. Similarly , by\nchoosing large values of x, one can verify that f(x) grows faster than fn (x) for any\npositive integer n.\nDefinition 3 The exponential function with positive base b > 1 is the function\ny = f(x) = bx\nThe graph of y = 10x is given in the Fig 5.9.\nIt is advised that the reader plots this graph for particular values of b like 2, 3 and 4.\nFollowing are some of the salient features of the exponential functions:\n(1) Domain of the exponential function is R, the set of all real numbers.\n(2) Range of the exponential function is the set of all positive real numbers.\n(3) The point (0, 1) is always on the graph of the exponential function (this is a\nrestatement of the fact that b0 = 1 for any real b > 1).\n(4) Exponential function is ever increasing; i.e., as we move from left to right, the\ngraph rises above.Fig  5.9\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCONTINUITY  AND DIFFERENTIABILITY 127\n(5) For very large negative values of x , the exponential function is very close to 0. In\nother words, in the second quadrant, the graph approaches x-axis (but never\nmeets it).\nExponential function with base 10 is called the common exponential function . In\nthe Appendix A.1.4 of Class XI, it was observed that the sum of the series\n1 11 ...1! 2!+ + +\nis a number between 2 and 3 and is denoted by e. Using this e as the base we obtain an\nextremely important exponential function y = ex.\nThis is called natural exponential function .\nIt would be interesting to know if the inverse of the exponential function exists and\nhas nice  interpretation. This search motivates the following definition.\nDefinition 4  Let b > 1 be a real number . Then we say logarithm of a to base b is x if\nbx = a.\nLogarithm of a to base b is denoted by logb a. Thus logb a = x if bx = \na.  Let us\nwork with a few explicit examples to get a feel for this. We know 23 = 8. In terms of\nlogarithms, we may rewrite this as log2 8 = 3. Similarly , 104 = 10000 is equivalent to\nsaying log10 10000 = 4. Also, 625 = 54 = 252 is equivalent to saying log5 625 = 4 or\nlog25 625 = 2.\nOn a slightly more mature note, fixing a  base b > 1, we may look at logarithm as\na function from positive real numbers to all real numbers. This function, called the\nlogarithmic function , is defined by\nlogb : R+ →R\nx →logb x = y   if by = x\nAs before if the base b = 10, we say it\nis common logarithms and if b  = e, then\nwe say it is natural logarithms . Often\nnatural logarithm is denoted by ln. In this\nchapter , log x  denotes the logarithm\nfunction to base e , i.e., ln x will be written\nas simpl y log x. The Fig 5.10 gives the plots\nof logarithm function to base 2, e and 10.\nSome of the important observations\nabout the logarithm function to any base\nb > 1 are listed below: Fig 5.10\nReprint 2025-26\n\n MA THEMA TICS 128\n Fig 5.1 1(1) We cannot make a meaningful definition of logarithm of non-positive numbers\nand hence the domain of log function is R+.\n(2) The range of log function is the set of all real numbers.\n(3) The point (1, 0) is always on the graph of the log function.\n(4) The log function is ever increasing,\ni.e., as we move from left to right\nthe graph rises above.\n(5) For x very near to zero, the value\nof log x can be made lesser than\nany given real number . In other\nwords in the fourth quadrant the\ngraph approaches y-axis (but\nnever meets it).\n(6) Fig 5.1 1 gives the plot of y = ex and\ny =\n ln x. It is of interest to observe\nthat the two curves are the mirror\nimages of each other reflected in the line y = x.\nTwo  properties of ‘log’  functions are proved below:\n(1) There is a standard change of base rule to obtain loga p in terms of logb p. Let\nloga p = α, logb p = β and logb a = γ. This means aα = p, bβ = p and bγ = a.\nSubstituting the third equation in the first one, we have\n(bγ)α =bγα = p\nUsing this in the second equation, we get\nbβ =p = bγα\nwhich implies β = αγ or α  =β\nγ. But then\nloga p =log\nlogb\nbp\na\n(2) Another interesting property of the log function is its effect on products. Let\nlogb pq = α. Then bα = pq. If logb p = β and logb q = γ, then bβ = p and bγ = q.\nBut then bα = \npq = bβbγ = bβ + γ\nwhich implies α = β + γ, i.e.,\nlogb pq =logb p + logb q\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCONTINUITY  AND DIFFERENTIABILITY 129\nA particularly interesting and important consequence of this is when p = q. In\nthis case the above may be rewritten as\nlogb p2 = logb p + logb p = 2 log p\nAn easy generalisation of this (left as an exercise!) is\nlogb pn =n log p\nfor any positive integer n. In fact this is true for any real number n, but we will\nnot attempt to prove this. On the similar lines the reader is invited to verify\nlogbx\ny =logb x – logb y\nExample 25 Is it true that x = elog x for all real x?\nSolution First, observe that the domain of log function is set of all positive real numbers.\nSo the above equation is not true for non-positive real numbers. Now , let y = elog x. If\ny > 0, we may take logarithm which gives us log y = log ( elog x) = log x . log e = log x. Thus\ny = x. Hence x = elog x is true only for positive values of x.\nOne of the striking properties of the natural exponential function in differential\ncalculus is that it doesn’t change during the process of differentiation. This is captured\nin the following theorem whose proof we skip.\nTheorem 5*\n(1) The derivative of ex w.r.t., x is ex; i.e., d\ndx(ex) = ex.\n(2) The derivative of log x w.r.t., x is 1\nx; i.e., d\ndx(log x) = 1\nx.\nExample 26 Dif ferentiate the following w .r.t. x:\n(i)e–x(ii)   sin (log x), x > 0     (iii)   cos–1 (ex)  (iv)    \necos x\nSolution\n(i)Let y = e–x.

Logarithmic Differentiation\nIn this section, we will learn to differentiate certain special class of functions given in\nthe form\ny =f(x) = [ u(x)]v (x)\nBy taking logarithm (to base e) the above may be rewritten as\nlog y =v(x) log [ u(x)]\nUsing chain rule we may differentiate this to get\n1 1( )( )dyv xy dx u x⋅ = ⋅  . u′(x) + v′(x) . log [ u(x)]\nwhich implies that\n[ ]( )( ) ( ) log ( )( )dy v xy u x v x u xdx u x = ⋅ ′ + ′ ⋅  \nThe main point to be noted in this method is that f(x) and u(x) must always be\npositive as otherwise their logarithms are not defined. This process of differentiation is\nknown as logarithms differ entiation and is illustrated by the following examples:\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCONTINUITY  AND DIFFERENTIABILITY 131\nExample 27 Dif ferentiate 2\n2( 3) ( 4)\n3 4 5x x\nx x− +\n+ + w.r.t. x.\nSolution  Let 2\n2( 3) ( 4)\n(3 4 5)x xy\nx x− +=\n+ +\nTaking logarithm on both sides, we have\nlog y =1\n2[log ( x – 3) + log (x2 + 4) – log (3 x2 + 4x + 5)]\nNow , differentiating both sides w .r.t. \nx, we get\n1dy\ny dx⋅ = 2 21 1 2 6 4\n2 ( 3) 4 3 4 5x x\nx x x x+  + − − + + +  \nordy\ndx = 2 21 2 6 4\n2 ( 3) 4 3 4 5y x x\nx x x x+  + − − + + +  \n=2\n2 2 21 ( 3)( 4) 1 2 6 4\n2 ( 3) 3 4 5 4 3 4 5x x x x\nx x x x x x− + +  + − − + + + + +  \nExample 28 Dif ferentiate ax w.r.t. x, where a is a positive constant.\nSolution  Let y = ax.

Differentiability\nRecall the following facts from previous class. We had defined the derivative of a real\nfunction as follows:\nSuppose f  is a real function and c is a point in its domain. The derivative of f at c is\ndefined by\n0( ) ( )lim\nhf c h f c\nh →+ −\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCONTINUITY  AND DIFFERENTIABILITY 119\nf(x) xnsin x cos x tan x\nf′(x) nxn–1cos x – sin x sec2 xprovided this limit exists. Derivative of f at c is denoted by f′(c) or ( ( )) |cdf xdx. The\nfunction defined by\n0( ) ( )( ) lim\nhf x h f xf xh →+ −′=\nwherever the limit exists is defined to be the derivative of f. The derivative of f is\ndenoted by f′(x) or ( ( ))df xdxor if y = f(x) by dy\ndxor y′. The process of finding\nderivative of a function is called dif ferentiation. We also use the phrase differ entiate\nf(x) with r espect to x to mean find f′(x).\nThe following rules were established as a part of algebra of derivatives:\n(1) (u ± v)′ = u′ ± \nv′\n(2) (uv)′ = u′v + uv′ (Leibnitz or product rule)\n(3)\n2u u v uv\nv v′′ − ′  =   , wherever v ≠ 0 (Quotient rule).\nThe following table gives a list of derivatives of certain standard functions:\nTable 5.3\nWhenever we defined derivative, we had put a caution provided the limit exists .\nNow the natural question is; what if it doesn’t? The question is quite pertinent and so is\nits answer . If  \n0( ) ( )lim\nhf c h f c\nh →+ − does not exist , we say that f is not dif ferentiable at c.\nIn other words, we say that a function f  is differentiable at a point c in its domain if both\n–0( ) ( )lim\nhf c h f c\nh →+ − and \n0( ) ( )lim\nhf c h f c\nh+→+ − are finite and equal. A function is said\nto be dif ferentiable in an interval [ a, b] if it is dif ferentiable at every point of [ a, b]. As\nin case of continuity , at the end points a and b, we take the right hand limit and left hand\nlimit, which are nothing but left hand derivative and right hand derivative of the function\nat a and b respectively . Similarly , a function is said to be dif ferentiable in an interval\n(a, b) if it is differentiable at every point of ( a, b).\nReprint 2025-26\n\n MA THEMA TICS 120\nTheorem 3  If a function f is differentiable at a point c, then it is also continuous at that\npoint.\nProof  Since f is differentiable at c, we have\n( ) ( )lim ( )\nx cf x f cf cx c →−= ′−\nBut for x  ≠ c, we have\nf(x) – f(c) =( ) ( ). ( )f x f cx cx c−−−\nTherefore lim [ ( ) ( )]\nx cf x f c\n→−  =( ) ( )lim .

Indeed we have\nseen that the function defined by f(x) = |x| is a continuous function. Consider the left\nhand limit\n–0(0 ) (\n0)lim 1\nhf h f h\nh h →+ − −= = −\nThe right hand limit\n0(0 ) (0)lim 1\nhf h f h\nh h+→+ −= =\nSince the above left and right hand limits at 0 are not equal, \n0(0 ) (0)lim\nhf h f\nh →+ −\ndoes not exist and hence f is not differentiable at 0. Thus f is not a differentiable\nfunction.\n5.3.1   Derivatives of composite functions\nTo study derivative of composite functions, we start with an illustrative example. Say ,\nwe want to find the derivative of f, where\nf(x) =(2x + 1)3\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCONTINUITY  AND DIFFERENTIABILITY 121\nOne way is to expand (2 x + 1)3 using binomial theorem and find the derivative as\na polynomial function as illustrated below .\n( )df xdx =3(2 1)dxdx  +  \n=3 2(8 12 6 1)dx x xdx+ + +\n=24x2 + 24 x + 6\n=6 (2x + 1)2\nNow , observe that f(x) =(h o g) (x)\nwhere g(x) = 2 x + 1 and h(x) = x3. Put \nt = g(x) = 2x  + 1. Then f( x) = h(t) = t3. Thus\ndf\ndx =6 (2x + 1)2 = 3(2x  + 1)2 . 2 = 3 t2 . 2 = dh dt\ndt dx⋅\nThe advantage with such observation is that it simplifies the calculation in finding\nthe derivative of, say , (2x + 1)100. We may formalise this observation in the following\ntheorem called the chain rule.\nTheorem 4  (Chain Rule) Let f be a real valued function which is a composite of two\nfunctions u and v; i.e., f = v o\n u. Suppose t = u(x) and if both dt\ndx and dv\ndt exist , we have\ndf dv dt\ndx dt dx= ⋅\nWe skip the proof of this theorem. Chain rule may be extended as follows. Suppose\nf is a real valued function which is a composite of three functions u, v and w ; i.e.,\nf = (w \no u) o v. If t = v( x) and s  = u(t), then\n( o ) df d w u dt dw ds dt\ndx dt dx ds dt dx= ⋅ = ⋅ ⋅\nprovided all the derivatives in the statement exist. Reader is invited to formulate chain\nrule for composite of more functions.\nExample 21 Find the derivative of the function given by f(x) = sin ( x2).\nSolution  Observe that the given function is a composite of two functions. Indeed, if\nt = u(x) = x2 and v(t) = sin \nt, then\nf(x) = (v o u) (x) = v(u(x)) = v (x2) = sin x2\nReprint 2025-26\n\n MA THEMA TICS 122\nPut t = u(x) = x2.

For example,\nconsider one of the following relationships between x and y :\nx – y – π =0\nx + sin xy – y =0\nIn the first case, we can solve for y  and rewrite the relationship as y = x – π. In\nthe second case, it does not seem that there is an easy way to solve for y . Nevertheless,\nthere is no doubt about the dependence of y on x in either of the cases. When a\nrelationship between x \nand y is expressed in a way that it is easy to solve for y  and\nwrite y  = f(x), we say that y is given as an explicit function of x. In the latter case it\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCONTINUITY  AND DIFFERENTIABILITY 123\nis implicit that y is a function of x and we say that the relationship of the second type,\nabove, gives function implicitly .

In this section, we shall\nlearn about a new class of (related) functions called exponential functions and logarithmic\nfunctions. It needs to be emphasized that many statements made in this section are\nmotivational and precise proofs of these are well beyond the scope of this text.\nThe Fig 5.9 gives a sketch of y = f1(x) = x, y = f2(x) = x2, y = f3(x) = x3 and y = f4(x)\n= x4. Observe that the curves get steeper as the power of x increases. Steeper the\ncurve, faster is the rate of growth. What this means is that for a fixed increment in the\nvalue of x(> 1), the increment in the value of y = fn (x) increases as n increases for n\n= 1, 2, 3, 4. It is conceivable that such a statement is true for all positive values of n,\nReprint 2025-26\n\n MA THEMA TICS 126\nwhere fn (x) = xn. Essentially , this means\nthat the graph of y  = fn (x) leans  more\ntowards the y-axis as n increases. For\nexample, consider f10(x) = x10 and \nf15(x)\n= x15. If x increases from 1 to 2, f10\nincreases from 1 to 210 whereas f15\nincreases from 1 to 215. Thus, for the same\nincrement in x, f15 grow faster than f10.\nUpshot of the above discussion is that\nthe growth of polynomial functions is\ndependent  on the degree of the polynomial\nfunction – higher the degree, greater is\nthe growth. The next natural question is:\nIs there a function which grows faster than any polynomial function. The answer is in\naffirmative and an example of such a function is\ny  = f(x) = 10x.\nOur claim is that this function f grows faster than fn (x) = xn for any positive integer n.\nFor example, we can prove that 10x grows faster than f100 (x) = x100. For large values\nof x like x  = 103, note that f100 (x) = (103)100 = 10300 whereas f(103) = 31010 = 101000.\nClearly f(x) is much greater than f100 (x). It is not difficult to prove that for all\nx > 103, f(x) > f100 (x). But we will not attempt to give a proof of this here. Similarly , by\nchoosing large values of x, one can verify that f(x) grows faster than fn (x) for any\npositive integer n.\nDefinition 3 The exponential function with positive base b > 1 is the function\ny = f(x) = bx\nThe graph of y = 10x is given in the Fig 5.9.\nIt is advised that the reader plots this graph for particular values of b like 2, 3 and 4.\nFollowing are some of the salient features of the exponential functions:\n(1) Domain of the exponential function is R, the set of all real numbers.\n(2) Range of the exponential function is the set of all positive real numbers.\n(3) The point (0, 1) is always on the graph of the exponential function (this is a\nrestatement of the fact that b0 = 1 for any real b > 1).\n(4) Exponential function is ever increasing; i.e., as we move from left to right, the\ngraph rises above.Fig  5.9\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCONTINUITY  AND DIFFERENTIABILITY 127\n(5) For very large negative values of x , the exponential function is very close to 0. In\nother words, in the second quadrant, the graph approaches x-axis (but never\nmeets it).\nExponential function with base 10 is called the common exponential function . In\nthe Appendix A.1.4 of Class XI, it was observed that the sum of the series\n1 11 ...1! 2!+ + +\nis a number between 2 and 3 and is denoted by e. Using this e as the base we obtain an\nextremely important exponential function y = ex.\nThis is called natural exponential function .\nIt would be interesting to know if the inverse of the exponential function exists and\nhas nice  interpretation. This search motivates the following definition.\nDefinition 4  Let b > 1 be a real number . Then we say logarithm of a to base b is x if\nbx = a.\nLogarithm of a to base b is denoted by logb a. Thus logb a = x if bx = \na.  Let us\nwork with a few explicit examples to get a feel for this. We know 23 = 8. In terms of\nlogarithms, we may rewrite this as log2 8 = 3. Similarly , 104 = 10000 is equivalent to\nsaying log10 10000 = 4. Also, 625 = 54 = 252 is equivalent to saying log5 625 = 4 or\nlog25 625 = 2.\nOn a slightly more mature note, fixing a  base b > 1, we may look at logarithm as\na function from positive real numbers to all real numbers. This function, called the\nlogarithmic function , is defined by\nlogb : R+ →R\nx →logb x = y   if by = x\nAs before if the base b = 10, we say it\nis common logarithms and if b  = e, then\nwe say it is natural logarithms . Often\nnatural logarithm is denoted by ln. In this\nchapter , log x  denotes the logarithm\nfunction to base e , i.e., ln x will be written\nas simpl y log x. The Fig 5.10 gives the plots\nof logarithm function to base 2, e and 10.\nSome of the important observations\nabout the logarithm function to any base\nb > 1 are listed below: Fig 5.10\nReprint 2025-26\n\n MA THEMA TICS 128\n Fig 5.1 1(1) We cannot make a meaningful definition of logarithm of non-positive numbers\nand hence the domain of log function is R+.\n(2) The range of log function is the set of all real numbers.\n(3) The point (1, 0) is always on the graph of the log function.\n(4) The log function is ever increasing,\ni.e., as we move from left to right\nthe graph rises above.\n(5) For x very near to zero, the value\nof log x can be made lesser than\nany given real number . In other\nwords in the fourth quadrant the\ngraph approaches y-axis (but\nnever meets it).\n(6) Fig 5.1 1 gives the plot of y = ex and\ny =\n ln x. It is of interest to observe\nthat the two curves are the mirror\nimages of each other reflected in the line y = x.\nTwo  properties of ‘log’  functions are proved below:\n(1) There is a standard change of base rule to obtain loga p in terms of logb p. Let\nloga p = α, logb p = β and logb a = γ. This means aα = p, bβ = p and bγ = a.\nSubstituting the third equation in the first one, we have\n(bγ)α =bγα = p\nUsing this in the second equation, we get\nbβ =p = bγα\nwhich implies β = αγ or α  =β\nγ. But then\nloga p =log\nlogb\nbp\na\n(2) Another interesting property of the log function is its effect on products. Let\nlogb pq = α. Then bα = pq. If logb p = β and logb q = γ, then bβ = p and bγ = q.\nBut then bα = \npq = bβbγ = bβ + γ\nwhich implies α = β + γ, i.e.,\nlogb pq =logb p + logb q\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCONTINUITY  AND DIFFERENTIABILITY 129\nA particularly interesting and important consequence of this is when p = q. In\nthis case the above may be rewritten as\nlogb p2 = logb p + logb p = 2 log p\nAn easy generalisation of this (left as an exercise!) is\nlogb pn =n log p\nfor any positive integer n. In fact this is true for any real number n, but we will\nnot attempt to prove this. On the similar lines the reader is invited to verify\nlogbx\ny =logb x – logb y\nExample 25 Is it true that x = elog x for all real x?\nSolution First, observe that the domain of log function is set of all positive real numbers.\nSo the above equation is not true for non-positive real numbers. Now , let y = elog x. If\ny > 0, we may take logarithm which gives us log y = log ( elog x) = log x . log e = log x. Thus\ny = x. Hence x = elog x is true only for positive values of x.\nOne of the striking properties of the natural exponential function in differential\ncalculus is that it doesn’t change during the process of differentiation. This is captured\nin the following theorem whose proof we skip.\nTheorem 5*\n(1) The derivative of ex w.r.t., x is ex; i.e., d\ndx(ex) = ex.\n(2) The derivative of log x w.r.t., x is 1\nx; i.e., d\ndx(log x) = 1\nx.\nExample 26 Dif ferentiate the following w .r.t. x:\n(i)e–x(ii)   sin (log x), x > 0     (iii)   cos–1 (ex)  (iv)    \necos x\nSolution\n(i)Let y = e–x.

Logarithmic Differentiation\nIn this section, we will learn to differentiate certain special class of functions given in\nthe form\ny =f(x) = [ u(x)]v (x)\nBy taking logarithm (to base e) the above may be rewritten as\nlog y =v(x) log [ u(x)]\nUsing chain rule we may differentiate this to get\n1 1( )( )dyv xy dx u x⋅ = ⋅  . u′(x) + v′(x) . log [ u(x)]\nwhich implies that\n[ ]( )( ) ( ) log ( )( )dy v xy u x v x u xdx u x = ⋅ ′ + ′ ⋅  \nThe main point to be noted in this method is that f(x) and u(x) must always be\npositive as otherwise their logarithms are not defined. This process of differentiation is\nknown as logarithms differ entiation and is illustrated by the following examples:\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCONTINUITY  AND DIFFERENTIABILITY 131\nExample 27 Dif ferentiate 2\n2( 3) ( 4)\n3 4 5x x\nx x− +\n+ + w.r.t. x.\nSolution  Let 2\n2( 3) ( 4)\n(3 4 5)x xy\nx x− +=\n+ +\nTaking logarithm on both sides, we have\nlog y =1\n2[log ( x – 3) + log (x2 + 4) – log (3 x2 + 4x + 5)]\nNow , differentiating both sides w .r.t. \nx, we get\n1dy\ny dx⋅ = 2 21 1 2 6 4\n2 ( 3) 4 3 4 5x x\nx x x x+  + − − + + +  \nordy\ndx = 2 21 2 6 4\n2 ( 3) 4 3 4 5y x x\nx x x x+  + − − + + +  \n=2\n2 2 21 ( 3)( 4) 1 2 6 4\n2 ( 3) 3 4 5 4 3 4 5x x x x\nx x x x x x− + +  + − − + + + + +  \nExample 28 Dif ferentiate ax w.r.t. x, where a is a positive constant.\nSolution  Let y = ax.
