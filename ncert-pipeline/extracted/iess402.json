There are certain basic rules that the citizens\nand the government have to follow. All such rules together are called\nconstitution. As the supreme law of the country, the constitution determines\nthe rights of citizens, the powers of the government and how the government\nshould function.\nIn this chapter we ask some basic questions about the constitutional\ndesign of a democracy. Why do we need a constitution? How are the\nconstitutions drawn up? Who designs them and in what way? What are\nthe values that shape the constitutions in democratic states? Once a\nconstitution is accepted, can we make changes later as required by the\nchanging conditions?\nOne recent instance of designing constitution for a democratic state is\nthat of South Africa. We begin this chapter by looking at what happened\nthere and how the South Africans went about this task of designing their\nconstitution. Then we turn to how the Indian Constitution was made,\nwhat its foundational values are, and how it provides a good framework\nfor the conduct of citizens’ life and that of the government.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n19\n2.1DEMOCRA TIC CONSTITUTI ON IN\nSOUTH  AFRIC\nA\n“I have fought against white domination\nand I have fought against black\ndomination. I have cherished the ideal of\na democratic and free society in which all\npersons live together in harmony and with\nequal opportunities. It is an ideal which I\nhope to live for and to achieve. But if\nneeds be, it is an ideal for which I am\nprepared to die. ”\nThis was Nelson Mandela, being\ntried for treason by the white South\nAfrican government. He and seven\nother leaders were sentenced to life\nimprisonment in 1964 for daring to\noppose the apartheid  regime in his\ncountry. He spent the next 27 years\nin South Africa’s most dreaded\nprison, Robben Island.\nS SS SStr trtr trtruggle against aparuggle against aparuggle against aparuggle against aparuggle against apar theid theidtheid theidtheid\nApartheid was the name of a system\nof racial discrimination unique to\nSouth Africa. The white Europeans\nimposed this system on South\nAfrica. During the seventeenth  and\neighteenth  centuries, the trading\ncompanies from Europe occupied it\nwith arms and force, in the way they\noccupied India. But unlike India, a\nlarge number of ‘whites’ had settled\nin South Africa and became the\nlocal rulers. The system ofapartheid divided the people and\nlabelled  them on the basis of their\nskin colour. The native people of\nSouth Africa are black in colour.\nThey made up  about three-fourth\nof the population and  were  called\n‘blacks’. Besides these two groups,\nthere were people of mixed races\nwho were called ‘coloured’ and\npeople who migrated from India.\nThe white rulers treated all non-\nwhites as inferiors. The non-whites\ndid not have voting rights.\nThe apartheid system was\nparticularly oppressive for the\nblacks. They were forbidden from\nliving in white areas. They could\nwork in white areas only if they had\na permit.

This was\ncalled segregation. They could not\neven visit the churches where the\nwhites worshipped. Blacks could not\nform associations or protest against\nthe terrible treatment.\nSince 1950, the blacks, coloured\nand Indians fought against the\napartheid system. They launched\nprotest marches and strikes. The\nAfrican National Congress (ANC) was\nthe umbrella organisation that led\nthe struggle against the policies of\nsegregation. This included many\nworkers’ unions and the Communist\nParty. Many sensitive whites also\njoined the ANC to oppose apartheid\nand played a leading role in this\nstruggle. Several countries de-\nnounced apartheid as unjust and\nracist. But the white racist govern-\nment continued to rule by detain-\ning, torturing and killing thousands\nof black and coloured people.\nACTIVITY\n/UIstopMake a poster on the life and str uggle of Nelson\nMandela.\n/UIstopIf available, read some por tions of his autobi-\nography , The L ong W alk to Freedom, in the\nclassroom.\nT TT TTo oo oow ww wwar arar arards a ne ds a neds a ne ds a neds a ne w c w cw c w cw constitution onstitutiononstitution onstitutiononstitution\nAs protests and struggles against\napartheid had increased, the\ngovernment realised that they could\nno longer keep the blacks under\ntheir rule through repression. The\nwhite regime changed its policies.\nDiscriminatory laws were repealed.\nBan on political parties and\nrestrictions on the media were lifted.\nAfter 28 years of imprisonment,\nNelson Mandela walked out of the\njail as a free man. Finally, at the\nmidnight of 26 April 1994, the newnational flag of the Republic of South\nAfrica was unfurled marking the\nnewly born democracy in the world.\nThe apartheid government came to\nan end, paving way for the formation\nof a multi-racial government.\nHow did this come about? Let us\nhear Mandela, the first president of\nthis new South Africa, on this extra-\nordinary transition:\n“Historical enemies succeeded in\nnegotiating a peaceful transition from\napartheid to democracy exactly because\nwe were prepared to accept the inherent\ncapacity for goodness in the other. My\nwish is that South Africans never give up\non the belief in goodness, that they\ncherish that faith in human beings is the\ncornerstone of our democracy.”\nAfter the emergence of the new\ndemocratic South Africa, black\nleaders appealed to fellow blacks to\nforgive the whites for the atrocities\nthey had committed while in power.\nThey said let us build a new South\nAfrica based on equality of all races\nand men and women, on democratic\nvalues, social justice and human\nrights. The party that ruled through\noppression and brutal killings and\nthe party that led the freedom\nstruggle sat together to draw up a\ncommon constitution .\nAfter two years of discussion and\ndebate they came out with one of the\nfinest constitutions the world has\never had. This constitution gave to\nits citizens the most extensive rights\navailable in any country. Together,\nthey decided that in the search for\na solution to the problems, nobody\nshould be excluded, no one should\nbe treated as a demon. They agreed\nthat everybody should become part\nof the solution, whatever they might\nhave done or represented in the\npast. The preamble  to the South\nAfrican Constitution (see page 28)\nsums up this spirit.What would have\nhappened in South\nAfrica if the black\nmajority had\ndecided to take\nrevenge on the\nwhites for all their\noppression and\nexploitation?\nReprint 2025-26\n\n21\nThe South African constitution\ninspires democrats all over the\nworld. A state denounced by the\nentire world till 1994 as the most\nundemocratic one is now seen as a\nmodel of democracy. What made this\nchange possible was the\ndetermination of the people of South\nAfrica to work together, to transform\nbitter experiences into the binding\nglue of a rainbow nation. Speaking\non the South African Constitution,\nMandela said:\n“The Constitution of South Africa speaks\nof both the past and the future. On the one\nhand, it is a solemn pact in which we, as\nSouth Africans, declare to one another that\nwe shall never permit a repetition of our\nracist, brutal and repressive past. But it is\nmore than that. It is also a charter for the\ntransformation of our country into one\nwhich is truly shared by all its people — a\ncountry which in the fullest sense belongs\nto all of us, black and white, women and\nmen.”\nThis image captures the spirit of South Africa today . South\nAfricans call themselves a ‘rainbow nation’. Can you guess\nwhy?\nDoes the story of South African struggle for freedom remind you of the Indian national movement? Make\na list of similarities and dissimilarities between the two on the following points:\n<Nature of colonialism\n<Relationship between different communities\n<Leadership: Gandhi/ Mandela\n<Party that led the str uggle: African National Congress/ Indian National Congress\n<Method of str uggle\n2.2 WHY  DO WE NEED A CONSTITUTION ?\nThe South African example is a good\nway to understand why we need a\nconstitution and what do\nconstitutions do. The oppressor and\nthe oppressed in this new democracy\nwere planning to live together as\nequals. It was not going to be easy for\nthem to trust each other. They hadtheir fears. They wanted to safeguard\ntheir interests. The black majority\nwas keen to ensure that the\ndemocratic principle of majority rule\nwas not compromised. They wanted\nsubstantial social and economic\nrights. The white minority was keen\nto protect its privileges and property.\nCONSTITUTI ONAL DESIGN\nWikipedia , GNU F ree Documentation License\nFor more details about South Africa, visit https://www.gov.za\nCHECK\nYOUR\nPROGRESS\nReprint 2025-26\n\n22 DEMOCRA TIC POLITICS\nAfter long negotiations both parties\nagreed to a compromise. The whites\nagreed to the principle of majority\nrule and that of one person one vote.\nThey also agreed to accept some\nbasic rights for the poor and the\nworkers. The blacks agreed that\nmajority rule would not be absolute.\nThey agreed that the majority would\nnot take away the property of the white\nminority. This compromise was not\neasy. How was this compromise going\nto be implemented? Even if they\nmanaged to trust each other, what\nwas the guarantee that this trust will\nnot be broken in future?\nThe only way to build and\nmaintain trust in such a situation\nis to write down some rules of the\ngame that everyone would abide by.\nThese rules lay down how the rulers\nare to be chosen in future. These\nrules also determine what the\nelected governments are empowered\nto do and what they cannot do.\nFinally these rules decide the rights\nof the citizen. These rules will work\nonly if the winner cannot change\nthem very easily. This is what the\nSouth Africans did. They agreed on\nsome basic rules. They also agreed\nthat these rules will be supreme,\nthat no government will be able to\nignore these. This set of basic rules\nis called a constitution.\nConstitution making is not unique\nto South Africa. Every country has\ndiverse groups of people. Their\nrelationship may not have been as\nbad as that between the whites and\nthe blacks in South Africa. But all over\nthe world people have differences of\nopinion and interests. Whether\ndemocratic or not, most countries in\nthe world need to have these basic\nrules. This applies not just to\ngovernments. Any association needs\nto have its constitution. It could be a\nclub in your area, a cooperativesociety or a political party, they all\nneed a constitution.\nACTIVITY\nApproach a club or cooperative society or union or\npolitical par ty in your locality . Get a copy of their\nrule book (it is of ten called R ules of Association)\nand read it. Are these r ules in accordance with\nprinciples of democracy? Do they give membership\nto any person without discrimination?\nThus, the constitution of a country\nis a set of written rules that are\naccepted by all people living together\nin a country. Constitution is the\nsupreme law that determines the\nrelationship among people living in\na territory (called citizens) and also\nthe relationship between the people\nand government. A constitution does\nmany things:\n/UIstopFirst, it generates a degree of trust\nand coordination that is necessary\nfor different kind of people to live\ntogether;\n/UIstopSecond, it specifies how the\ngovernment will be constituted,\nwho will have power to take which\ndecisions;\n/UIstopThird, it lays down limits on the\npowers of the government and tells\nus what the rights of the citizens\nare; and\n/UIstopFourth, it expresses the\naspirations of the people about\ncreating a good society.\nAll countries that have constitutions\nare not necessarily democratic. But\nall countries that are democratic will\nhave constitutions. After the War of\nIndependence against Great Britain,\nthe Americans gave themselves a\nconstitution. After the Revolution, the\nFrench people approved a democratic\nconstitution. Since then it has\nbecome a practice in all democracies\nto have a written constitution.This is not fair!\nWhat was the point\nin having a\nConstituent\nAssembly in India if\nall the basics were\nalready decided?\nReprint 2025-26\n\n23\n CONSTITUTI ONAL DESIGN2.3 M AKING  OF THE INDIAN  CONSTITUTION\nlike. Much of this consensus had\nevolved during the freedom struggle.\nOur national movement was not\nmerely a struggle against a foreign\nrule. It was also a struggle to\nrejuvenate our country and to\ntransform our society and politics.\nThere were sharp differences of\nopinion within the freedom struggle\nabout the path India should take\nafter Independence. Such\ndifferences exist even today. Yet\nsome basic ideas had come to be\naccepted by almost everyone.\nAs far back as in 1928, Motilal\nNehru and eight other Congress\nleaders drafted a constitution for\nIndia. In 1931, the resolution at the\nKarachi session of the Indian\nNational Congress dwelt on how\nindependent India’s constitution\nshould look like. Both these\ndocuments were committed  to the\ninclusion of universal adult franchise,\nright to freedom and equality and to\nprotecting the rights of minorities in\nthe constitution of independent India.\nThus some basic values were\naccepted by all leaders much before\nthe Constituent Assembly  met to\ndeliberate on the Constitution.\nThe familiarity with political\ninstitutions of colonial rule also\nhelped develop an agreement over\nthe institutional design. The British\nrule had given voting rights only to\na few. On that basis the British had\nintroduced very weak legislatures.\nElections were held in 1937 to\nProvincial Legislatures and\nMinistries all over British India.\nThese were not fully democratic\ngovernments. But the experience\ngained by Indians in the working of\nthe legislative institutions proved to\nbe very useful for the country in\nsetting up its own institutions andLike South Africa, India’s\nConstitution was also drawn up\nunder very difficult circumstances.\nThe making of the constitution for a\nhuge and diverse country like India\nwas not an easy affair. At that time\nthe people of India were emerging\nfrom the status of subjects to that\nof citizens. The country was born\nthrough a partition on the basis of\nreligious differences. This was a\ntraumatic experience for the people\nof India and Pakistan.\nAtleast ten lakh people were killed\non both sides of the border in\npartition related violence. There was\nanother problem. The British had\nleft it to the rulers of the princely\nstates to decide whether they\nwanted to merge with India or with\nPakistan or remain independent.\nThe merger of these princely states\nwas a difficult and uncertain task.\nWhen the constitution was being\nwritten, the future of the country did\nnot look as secure as it does today.\nThe makers of the constitution had\nanxieties about the present and the\nfuture of the country.\nACTIVITY\nSpeak to your grandparents or some other elders\nin your locality .

That is why the\nIndian constitution adopted many\ninstitutional details and procedures\nfrom colonial laws like the Government\nof India Act , 1935.\nYears of thinking and deliberation\non the framework of the constitution\nhad another benefit. Our leaders\ngained confidence to learn from\nother countries, but on our own\nterms. Many of our leaders were\ninspired by the ideals of French\nRevolution, the practice of\nparliamentary democracy in Britain\nand the Bill of Rights in the US. The\nsocialist revolution in Russia had\ninspired many Indians to think of\nshaping a system based on social\nand economic equality. Yet they\nwere not simply imitating what\nothers had done. At each step they\nwere questioning whether these\nthings suited our country. All these\nfactors contributed to the making of\nour Constitution.\nT TT TThe C he Che C he Che C onstituen onstituenonstituen onstituenonstituen t A t At A t At Assembly ssemblyssembly ssemblyssembly\nWho, then, were the makers of the\nIndian Constitution?

Its\nfirst meeting was held in December\n1946. Soon after, the country was\ndivided into India and Pakistan. The\nConstituent Assembly was also\ndivided into the Constituent Assembly\nof India and that of Pakistan. The\nConstituent Assembly that wrote\nthe Indian constitution had 299\nmembers. The Assembly adopted\nthe Constitution on 26 November\n1949 but it came into effect on 26\nJanuary 1950. To mark this day we\ncelebrate January 26 as Republic\nDay every year.\nWhy should we accept the\nConstitution made by this Assembly\nmore than seven decades ago? We\nhave already noted one reason\nabove. The Constitution does not\nreflect the views of its members\nalone. It expresses a broad\nconsensus of its time. Many\ncountries of the world have had to\nrewrite their Constitution afresh\nbecause the basic rules were not\nacceptable to all major social groups\nor political parties. In some other\ncountries, the Constitution exists\nas a mere piece of paper. No one\nactually follows it. The experience\nof our Constitution is different. Over\nthe last half a century, several\ngroups have questioned some\nprovisions of the Constitution. But\nno large social group or political\nparty has ever questioned the\nlegitimacy of the Constitution itself.\nThis is an unusual achievement for\nany constitution.\nThe second reason for accepting\nthe Constitution is that the\nConstituent Assembly represented\nthe people of India. There was no\nuniversal adult franchise at that\ntime. So the Constituent Assembly\ncould not have been chosen directly\nby all the people of India.

This\nensured a fair geographical share of\nmembers from all the regions of the\ncountry. The Assembly was\ndominated by the Indian National\nCongress, the party that led India’s\nfreedom struggle. But the Congress\nitself included a variety of political\ngroups and opinions. The Assembly\nhad many members who did not\nagree with the Congress. In social\nterms too, the Assembly represented\nmembers from different language\ngroups, castes, classes, religions\nand occupations. Even if the\nConstituent Assembly was elected\nby universal adult franchise, its\ncomposition would not have been\nvery different.\nFinally, the manner in which the\nConstituent Assembly worked gives\nsanctity to the Constitution. TheConstituent Assembly worked in a\nsystematic, open and consensual\nmanner. First some basic principles\nwere decided and agreed upon. Then\na Drafting Committee chaired by Dr.\nB.R. Ambedkar prepared a draft\nconstitution for discussion. Several\nrounds of thorough discussion took\nplace on the Draft Constitution,\nclause  by clause. More than two\nthousand amendments were\nconsidered. The members\ndeliberated for 114 days spread over\nthree years. Every document\npresented and every word spoken in\nthe Constituent Assembly has been\nrecorded and preserved. These are\ncalled ‘Constituent Assembly\nDebates’. When printed, these\ndebates are 12 bulky volumes! These\ndebates provide the rationale behind\nevery provision of the Constitution.\nThese are used to interpret the\nmeaning of the Constitution.\nRead the infor mation about all the makers of the Indian Constitution given in the side columns here.

He\noften bitterly criticised Mahatma\nGandhi and his vision. In his conclud-\ning speech to the Constituent Assem\nbly he stated his anxiety very clearly:\nOn the 26th of January 1950 we are going to enter a life of contradictions.\nIn politics we will have equality and in social and economic life we will have\ninequality .

The government\nis run according to\nsome basic rules.Let us read the Preamble of our Constitution very\ncarefully and understand the meaning of each of its\nkey words.\nThe Preamble of the Constitution reads like a poem\non democracy. It contains the philosophy on which the\nentire Constitution has been built. It provides a standard\nto examine and evaluate any law and action of\ngovernment, to find out whether it is good or bad. It is\nthe soul of the Indian Constitution.\nNote: *The terms ‘Socialist’ and ‘Secular’ were added in\nPreamble through the 42nd Constitutional Amendment\nin 1976.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n30 DEMOCRA TIC POLITICS\nGLOSSAR Y\nCompare the P reambles to the constitutions of the United States of America, India and South Africa.\n/UIstopMake a list of ideas that are common to all these three.\n/UIstopNote down at least one of the major differences among these.\n/UIstopWhich of the three makes a reference to the past?\n/UIstopWhich of these does not invoke God?\nInstitutional designInstitutional designInstitutional designInstitutional designInstitutional design\nA constitution is not merely a\nstatement of values and philosophy.\nAs we noted above, a constitution is\nmainly about embodying these values\ninto institutional arrangements.\nMuch of the document called\nConstitution of India is about these\narrangements. It is a very long and\ndetailed document. Therefore it needs\nto be amended quite regularly to keep\nit updated. Those who crafted the\nIndian Constitution felt that it has to\nbe in accordance with people’s\naspirations and changes in society.\nThey did not see it as a sacred, static\nand unalterable law. So, they made\nprovisions to incorporate changes\nfrom time to time. These changes are\ncalled constitutional amendments.\nThe Constitution describes the\ninstitutional arrangements in a very\nlegal language. If you read the\nConstitution for the first time, it canbe quite difficult to understand. Yet\nthe basic institutional design is not\nvery difficult to understand. Like any\nConstitution, the Indian\nConstitution lays down a procedure\nfor choosing persons to govern the\ncountry. It defines who will have how\nmuch power to take which decisions.\nAnd it puts limits to what the\ngovernment can do by providing\nsome rights to the citizen that\ncannot be violated. The remaining\nthree chapters in this book are about\nthese three aspects of the working\nof Indian constitution. We shall look\nat some key constitutional\nprovisions in each chapter and\nunderstand how they work in\ndemocratic politics. But this\ntextbook will not cover all the salient\nfeatures of the institutional design\nin the Indian Constitution. Some\nother aspects will be covered in your\ntextbook next year.\nApartheid : The official policy of racial separation and ill treatment of blacks\nfollowed by the government of South Africa between 1948 and 1989.\nClause : A distinct section of a document.\nConstituent Assembly : An assembly of people’s representatives that writes\na constitution for a country.\nConstitution : Supreme law of a country, containing fundamental rules\ngoverning the politics and society in a country.\nConstitutional amendment: A change in the constitution made by the\nsupreme legislative body in a country.\nDraft : A preliminary version of a legal document.\nPhilosophy: The most fundamental principles underlying one’s thoughts\nand actions.\nPreamble: An introductory statement in a constitution which states the\nreasons and guiding values of the constitution.\nTreason: The offence of attempting to overthrow the government of the\nstate to which the offender owes allegiance.\nTryst : A meeting or meeting place that has been agreed upon.\nCHECK\nYOUR\nPROGRESS\nReprint 2025-26\n\n31exercises1 Here are some false statements.

We received training\nto work with representative legislative institutions under the British\nrule.\nbFreedom Struggle challenged the colonial exploitation and denial\nof different freedoms to Indians. Free India could not be anything\nbut democratic.\ncWe were lucky to have leaders who had democratic convictions.\nThe denial of democracy in several other newly independent\ncountries shows the important role of these leaders.\n9 Read the following extract from a conduct book for ‘married women’,\npublished in 1912. ‘ God has made the female species delicate and fragile\nboth physically and emotionally, pitiably incapable of self-defence. They are\ndestined thus by God to remain in male protection – of father, husband and son\n– all their lives.

Or does this go against the constitutional values?\n10 Read the following statements about a constitution.
