Thus, the mean deviation\nabout median calculated for such series can not be fully relied.\nThe sum of the deviations from the mean (minus signs ignored) is more than the sum\nof the deviations from median. Therefore, the mean deviation about the mean is not very\nscientific.Thus, in many cases, mean deviation may give unsatisfactory results. Also mean\ndeviation is calculated on the basis of absolute values of the deviations and therefore,\ncannot be subjected to further algebraic treatment. This implies that we must have some\nother measure of dispersion. Standard deviation is such a measure of dispersion.\n13.5 Variance and Standard Deviation\nRecall that while calculating mean deviation about mean or median, the absolute values\nof the deviations were taken. The absolute values were taken to give meaning to the\nmean deviation, otherwise the deviations may cancel among themselves.\nAnother way to overcome this difficulty which arose due to the signs of deviations,\nis to take squares of all the deviations. Obviously all these squares of deviations are\nReprint 2025-26\n\n272 MATHEMA TICS\nnon-negative. Let x1, x2, x3, ..., xn be n observations and x be their mean. Then\n22 2 2 2\n1\n1( ) ( ) ....... ( ) ( )n\nn i\nix x x x x x x x\n=− + − + + − = −  .\nIf this sum is  zero, then each ) (x xi− has to be zero. This implies that there is no\ndispersion at all as all observations are equal to the mean x.\nIf ∑\n=−n\niix x\n12) (is small , this indicates that the observations x1, x2, x3,...,xn are\nclose to the mean xand therefore, there is a lower degree of dispersion. On the\ncontrary , if this sum is lar ge, there is a higher degree of dispersion of the observations\nfrom the mean x. Can we thus say that the sum ∑\n=−n\niix x\n12) ( is a reasonable indicator\nof the degree of dispersion or scatter?\nLet us take the set A of six observations 5, 15, 25, 35, 45, 55. The mean of the\nobservations is x= 30. The sum of squares of deviations from xfor this set is\n∑\n=−6\n12) (\niix x= (5–30)2 + (15–30)2 + (25–30)2  + (35–30)2 + (45–30)2 +(55–30)2\n                         = 625 + 225 + 25 + 25 + 225 + 625 = 1750\nLet us now take another set B of 31 observations 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23,\n24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45. The\nmean of these observations is y= 30\nNote that both the sets A and B of observations have a mean of 30.\nNow, the sum of squares of  deviations of observations for set B from the mean y is\ngiven by\n∑\n=−31\n12) (\niiy y = (15–30)2 +(16–30)2 + (17–30)2  + ...+ (44–30)2 +(45–30)2\n=  (–15)2 +(–14)2 + ...+ (–1)2 + 02 + 12 + 22 + 32 + ...+ 142 + 152\n=  2 [152 + 142 + ... + 12]\n= 15 (15 1) (30 1)26× + +× = 5 × 16 × 31 = 2480\n(Because sum of squares of first n natural numbers = ( 1) (2 1)\n6n n n+ +. Here n = 15)\nReprint 2025-26\n\n  STATISTICS            273\nIf ∑\n=−n\niix x\n12) ( is simply our measure of dispersion or scatter about mean, we\nwill tend to say that the set A of six observations has a lesser dispersion about the mean\nthan the set B of 31 observations, even though the observations in set A are more\nscattered from the mean (the range of deviations being from –25 to 25) than in the set\nB (where the range of deviations is from –15 to 15).\nThis is also clear from the following diagrams.\nFor the set A, we have\nFor the set B, we have\nThus, we can say that the sum of squares of deviations from the mean is not a proper\nmeasure of dispersion. To overcome this dif ficulty we take the mean of the squ ares of\nthe deviations, i.e., we take ∑\n=−n\niix xn12) (1\n. In case of the set A, we have\n1Mean6=× 1750 = 291.67 and in case of the set B, it is 1\n31× 2480 = 80.\nThis indicates that the scatter or dispersion is more in set A than  the scatter or dispersion\nin set B, which confirms with the geometrical representation of the two sets.\nThus, we can take  ∑−2) (1x xni as a quantity which leads to a proper measure\nof dispersion. This number , i.e., mean of the squares of the deviations from mean is\ncalled the variance  and is denoted by 2σ(read as sigma square). Therefore, the\nvariance of n observations x1, x2,..., xn is given byFig 13.5\nFig 13.6\nReprint 2025-26\n\n274 MATHEMA TICS\nDeviations from mean\n(xi–x)∑\n=− =n\niix xn12 2) (1σ\n13.5.1  Standard Deviation  In the calculation of variance, we find that the units of\nindividual observations xi and the unit of their mean xare different from that of variance,\nsince variance involves the sum of squares of  ( xi–x). For this reason, the  proper\nmeasure of dispersion about the mean of a set of observations is expressed as positive\nsquare-root of the variance and is called standar d deviation . Therefore, the standard\ndeviation, usually denoted by σ, is given by\n∑\n=− =n\niix xn12) (1σ ...

If\neach observation is multiplied by 3, find the new mean and new standard deviation\nof the resulting observations.\n4. Given that xis the mean and σ2 is the variance of n observations x1, x2, ...,xn.\nProve that the mean and variance of the observations ax1, ax2, ax3, ...., axn are\nax and a2 σ2, respectively , (a ≠ 0).\n5. The mean and standard deviation of 20 observations are found to be 10 and 2,\nrespectively . On rechecking, it was found that an observation 8 was incorrect.\nCalculate the correct mean and standard deviation in each of the following cases:\n(i) If wrong item is omitted. (ii) If it is replaced by 12.\n6. The mean and standard deviation of a group of 100 observations were found to\nbe 20 and 3, respectively . Later on it was found that three observations were\nincorrect, which were recorded as 21, 21 and 18. Find the mean and standard\ndeviation if the incorrect observations are omitted.\nSummary\n®Measures of dispersion Range, Quartile deviation, mean deviation, variance,\nstandard deviation are measures of dispersion.\nRange = Maximum Value – Minimum Value\n®Mean deviation for ungrouped data\nMM.D. ( ) M.D. (M)i i x – x x –x ,n n= =∑ ∑\nReprint 2025-26\n\n  STATISTICS            287\n®Mean deviation for grouped data\nM.D.NM.D. MM\nNwhere N ( )□, ( )□, xf x x f xfi i i i\ni = = =∑ ∑∑\n®Variance and standard deviation for  ungr ouped data\n2 2 1( )ix – xnσ=∑ ,2 1( – )ix xnσ=∑\n®Variance and standard deviation of a discr ete fr equency distribution\n( ) ( )2 2 21 1,N Ni i i if x x f x x σ σ = − = − ∑ ∑\n®Variance and standard deviation of a continuous fr equency distribution\n( ) ( )2 2 2 2 1 1, NN Ni i i i i i f x x f x f x σ σ = − = − ∑ ∑ ∑\n®Shortcut method to find variance and standard deviation.\n( )222 2\n2N\nNi i i ihf y fy σ = −   ∑ ∑ , ( )22NNi i i ihf y f y σ= −∑ ∑ ,\nwhere Ai\nixyh−=\nHistorical Note\n‘Statistics’ is derived from the Latin word ‘status’ which means a political\nstate. This suggests that statistics is as old as human civilisation. In the year 3050\nB.C., perhaps the first census was held in Egypt. In India also, about 2000 years\nago, we had an ef ficient system of collecting administrative statistics, particularly ,\nduring the regime of Chandra Gupta Maurya (324-300 B.C.). The system of\ncollecting data related to births and deaths is mentioned in Kautilya’ s Arthshastra\n(around 300 B.C.) A detailed account of administrative surveys conducted during\nAkbar ’s regime is given in Ain-I-Akbari written by Abul Fazl.\nCaptain John Graunt of London (1620-1674) is known as father of vital\nstatistics due to his studies on statistics of births and deaths. Jacob Bernoulli\n(1654-1705) stated the Law of Large numbers in his book “Ars Conjectandi’,\npublished in 1713.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n288 MATHEMA TICS\n—vvvvv—The theoretical development of statistics came during the mid seventeenth\ncentury and continued after that with the introduction of theory of games and\nchance (i.e., probability). Francis Galton (1822-1921), an Englishman, pioneered\nthe use of statistical methods, in the field of Biometry . Karl Pearson (1857-1936)\ncontributed a lot to the development of statistical studies with his discovery\nof Chi squar e test  and foundation of statistical laborator y in England (191 1).\nSir Ronald A. Fisher (1890-1962), known as the Father of modern statistics,\napplied it to various diversified fields such as Genetics, Biometry , Education,\nAgriculture, etc.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n",
