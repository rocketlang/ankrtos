Similarly , in the second arrangement, the entries in the first row represent\nthe number of notebooks possessed by Radha, Fauzia and Simran, respectively . The\nentries in the second row represent the number of pens possessed by Radha, Fauzia\nand Simran, respectively . An arrangement or display of the above kind is called a\nmatrix . Formally , we define matrix as:\nDefinition 1   A matrix  is an ordered rectangular array of numbers or functions. The\nnumbers or functions are called the elements or the entries of the matrix.\nWe denote matrices by capital letters. The following are some examples of matrices:\n5 – 2\nA 0 5\n3 6 \n = \n  , 12 32\nB 3.5 –1 2\n53 57i + − \n = \n \n  ,  31 3Ccos tan sin 2x x\nx x x  += +  \nIn the ab ove examples, the horizontal lines of elements are said to constitute, rows\nof the matrix and the vertical lines of elements are said to constitute, columns  of the\nmatrix. Thus A has 3 rows and 2 columns, B has 3 rows and 3 columns while C has 2\nrows and 3 columns.\n3.2.1   Order of a matrix\nA matrix having m rows and n columns is called a matrix of order m × n or simply m × n\nmatrix (read as an m by n matrix). So referring to the above examples of matrices, we\nhave A as 3 × 2 matrix, B as 3 × 3 matrix and C as 2 × 3 matrix.  We observe that A has\n3 × 2 = 6 elements, B and C have 9 and 6 elements, respectively .\nIn general, an m × n matrix has the following rectangular array:\norA = [ aij]m × n, 1≤ i ≤ m, 1≤ j ≤ n   i, j ∈ N\nThus the ith  row consists of the elements ai1, ai2, ai3,..., ain, while the jth column\nconsists of the elements a1j, a2j, a3j,..., amj,\nIn general aij, is an element lying in the ith row and jth column. We can also call\nit as the ( i, j)th element of A. The number of elements in an m × n matrix will be\nequal to mn.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nMATRI CES         37\nANote   In this chapter\n1.We shall follow the notation, namely A = [aij]m × n to indicate that A is a matrix\nof order m × n.\n2.We shall consider only those matrices whose elements are real numbers or\nfunctions taking real values.\nWe can also represent any point ( x, y) in a plane by a matrix (column or row) as\nx\ny \n   (or [ x, y]). For example point P(0, 1) as a matrix representation may be given as\n0P1 =   or [0 1].\nObserve that in this way we can also express the vertices of a closed rectilinear\nfigure in the form of a matrix. For example, consider a quadrilateral ABCD with vertices\nA (1, 0), B (3, 2), C (1, 3), D (–1, 2).\nNow , quadrilateral ABCD in the matrix form, can be represented as\n2 4A B C D\n1 3 1 1X0 2 3 2×−  =  or\n4 2A 1 0\nB 3 2YC 1 3\nD 1 2× \n \n = \n − \nThus, matrices can be used as representation of vertices of geometrical figures in\na plane.\nNow , let us consider some examples.\nExample 1  Consider the following information regarding the number of men and women\nworkers in three factories I, II and III\nMen workers Women workers\nI 30 25\nII 25 31\nIII 27 26\nRepresent the above information in the form of a 3 × 2 matrix. What does the entry\nin the third row and second column represent?\nReprint 2025-26\n\n 38 MATHEMA TICS\nSolution The information is represented in the form of a 3 × 2 matrix as follows:\n30 25\nA 25 31\n27 26 \n = \n  \nThe ent ry in the third row and second column represents the number of women\nworkers in factory III.\nExample 2  If a matrix has 8 elements, what are the possible orders it can have?\nSolution We know that if a matrix is of order m × n, it has mn elements. Thus, to find\nall possible orders of a matrix with 8 elements, we will find all ordered pairs of natural\nnumbers, whose product is 8.\nThus, all possible ordered pairs are (1, 8), (8, 1), (4, 2), (2, 4)\nHence, possible orders are 1 × 8, 8 ×1, 4 × 2, 2 × 4\nExample 3\n Construct a 3 × 2 matrix whose elements are given by 1| 3 |2ija i j= − .\nSolution In general a 3 × 2 matrix is given by 11 12\n21 22\n31 32Aa a\na a\na a \n = \n  .\nNow1| 3 |2ija i j= − , i = 1, 2, 3  and  j = 1, 2.\nTherefore 111|1 3 1| 12a= − × =121 5|1 3 2 |2 2a= − × =\n211 1| 2 3 1|2 2a= − × =221| 2 3 2 | 22a= − × =\n311| 3 3 1| 02a= − × =321 3| 3 3 2 |2 2a= − × =\nHence the required matrix is given by 51\n21A 2230\n2 \n \n = \n \n  .\nReprint 2025-26\n\nMATRI CES         39\n3.3  Types of Matrices\n In this section, we shall discuss different types of matrices.\n(i)Column matrix\nA matrix is said to be a column matrix  if it has only one column.\nFor example,  0\n3\nA 1\n1/ 2 \n \n \n = − \n   is a column matrix of order 4 × 1.\nIn general, A = [aij]m × 1 is a column matrix of order m × 1.\n(ii) Row matrix\nA matrix is said to be a row matrix  if it has only one row .\nFor example, \n1 41B 5 2 32 × = −   is a row matrix.\nIn general, B = [ bij]1 × n is a row matrix of order 1 × n.\n(iii) Square matrix\nA matrix in which the number of rows are equal to the number of columns, is\nsaid to be a squar e matrix . Thus an m × n matrix is said to be a square matrix if\nm = n and is known as a square matrix of order ‘ n’.\nFor example 3 1 0\n3A 3 2 12\n4 3 1−  \n \n  = \n −   is a square matrix of order 3.\nIn general, A = [aij]m × m is a square matrix of order m.\nANote  If A = [ aij] is a square matrix of order n, then elements (entries) a11, a22, ..., ann\nare said to constitute the diagonal , of the matrix A. Thus, if 1 3 1\nA 2 4 1\n3 5 6− \n = − \n  .\nThen the elements of the diagonal of A are 1, 4, 6.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n 40 MATHEMA TICS\n(iv) Diagonal matrix\nA square matrix B = [ bij]m × m is said to be a diagonal matrix  if all its non\ndiagonal elements are zero, that is a matrix B = [ bij]m × m is said to be a diagonal\nmatrix if bij = 0, when i ≠ j.\nFor example,  A = [4], 1 0B0 2− =  , 1.1 0 0\nC 0 2 0\n0 0 3− \n = \n  , are diagonal matrices\nof order 1, 2, 3, respectively .\n(v) Scalar matrix\nA diagonal matrix is said to be a scalar matrix if its diagonal elements are equal,\nthat is, a square matrix B = [ bij]n × n is said to be a scalar matrix if\nbij = 0,    when i  ≠ j\nbij = k,   when i  = j, for some constant k.\nFor example\nA = [3],     1 0B0 1− = −  ,      3 0 0\nC 0 3 0\n0 0 3 \n \n= \n \n \nare scalar matrices of order 1, 2 and 3, respectively .\n(vi) Identity matrix\nA square matrix in which elements in the diagonal are all 1 and rest are all zero\nis called an identity matrix . In other words, the square matrix A = [ aij]n × n is an\nidentity matrix, if 1 if\n0 ifiji jai j= =≠ .\nWe denote the identity matrix of order n by In. When order is clear from the\ncontext, we simply write it as I.\nFor example [1], 1 0\n0 1 \n  , 1 0 0\n0 1 0\n0 0 1 \n \n \n   are identity matrices of order 1, 2 and 3,\nrespectively .\nObserve that a scalar matrix is an identity matrix when k = 1. But every identity\nmatrix is clearly a scalar matrix.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nMATRI CES         41\n(vii) Zero matrix\nA matrix is said to be zero matrix  or null matrix  if all its elements are zero.\nFor example, [0], 0 0\n0 0 \n  , 0 0 0\n0 0 0 \n  , [0, 0] are all zero matrices. We denote\nzero matrix by O. Its order will be clear from the context.\n3.3.1  Equality of matrices\nDefinition 2 Two matrices A = [aij] and B = [ bij] are said to be equal if\n(i)they are of the same order\n(ii) each element of A is equal to the corresponding element of B, that is aij = bij for\nall i and j.\nFor example, 2 3 2 3and0 1 0 1   \n       are equal matrices but 3 2 2 3and0 1 0 1   \n       are\nnot equal matrices. Symbolically , if two matrices A and B are equal, we write A = B.\nIf 1.5 0\n2 6\n3 2x y\nz a\nb c−   \n   =   \n      , then x  = – 1.5, y = 0, z  = 2, a = 6, b = 3, c = 2\nExample 4 If  3 4 2 7 0 6 3 2\n6 1 0 6 3 2 2\n3 21 0 2 4 21 0x z y y\na c\nb b+ + − −    \n   − − = − − +   \n    − − + −    \nFind the values of a, b, c, x, y and z.\nSolution As the given matrices are equal, therefore, their corresponding elements\nmust be equal. Comparing the corresponding elements, we get\nx + 3= 0, z + 4 = 6, 2y – 7= 3y – 2\na – 1 = – 3, 0 =2c + 2 b – 3 = 2b + 4,\nSimplifying, we get\na = – 2,\n b = – 7, c = – 1, x = – 3, y = –5, z  = 2\nExample 5 Find the values of a, b, c, and d from the following equation:\n2 2 4 3\n5 4 3 11 24a b a b\nc d c d+ − −    =    − +   \nReprint 2025-26\n\n 42 MATHEMA TICS\nSolution By equality of two matrices, equating the corresponding elements, we get\n2a + b =4 5c – d =11\na – 2b =– 3 4c + 3d =24\nSolving these equations, we get\na = 1, b =2, c = 3 and d = 4\nEXERCISE 3.1\n1.In the matrix 2 5 19 7\n5A 35 2 122\n17 3 1 5 −\n \n  = −\n \n −  , write:\n(i)The order of the matrix, (ii)The number of elements,\n(iii)Write the elements a13, a21, a33, a24, a23.\n2.If a matrix has 24 elements, what are the possible orders it can have?

We observe that, for\nmultiplication of two matrices A and B, the number of columns in A should be equal to\nthe number of rows in B. Furthermore for getting the elements of the product matrix,\nwe take rows of A and columns of B, multiply them element-wise and take the sum.\nFormally , we define multiplication of matrices as follows:\nThe product  of two matrices A and B is defined  if the number of columns of A is\nequal to the number of rows of B. Let A = [aij] be an m × n matrix and B = [ bjk] be an\nn × p matrix. Then the product of the matrices A and B is the matrix C of order m × p.\nTo get the ( i, k)th element cik of the matrix C, we take the ith row of A and kth column\nof B, multiply them elementwise and take the sum of all these products. In other words ,\nif A = [aij]m × n, B = [bjk]n × p, then the ith row of A is [ai1 ai2 ... ain] and the kth column of\nB is 1\n2\n.\n.\n.k\nk\nnkb\nb\nb \n \n \n \n \n   , then cik =  ai1 b1k + ai2 b2k + ai3 b3k + ... + ain bnk = \n1n\nij jk\nja b\n=∑ .\nThe matrix C = [ cik]m × p is the product of A and B.\nFor example, if 1 1 2C0 3 4− =   and 2 7\n1 D 1\n5 4 \n = − \n  −   , then the product CD is defined\nReprint 2025-26\n\n 52 MATHEMA TICS\nand is given by 2 71 1 2CD 1 10 3 45 4 −   = −      −  .

In the above example, AB is\ndefined but BA  is not defined because B has 3 column while A has only 2 (and not 3)\nrows. If A, B are, respectively m × n, k × l matrices, then both AB and BA  are defined\nif and only if  n = k and l = m. In particular , if both A and B are square matrices of the\nsame order , then both AB and BA  are defined.\nNon-commutativity of multiplication of matrices\nNow , we shall see by an example that even if AB and BA  are both defined, it is not\nnecessary that AB = BA.\nExample 13  If 2 31 2 3A and B 4 54 2 52 1 −    = =     −   , then find AB, BA.

But\none may think that perhaps AB and BA  could be the same if they were of the same\norder . But it is not so, here we give an example to show that even if AB and BA  are of\nsame order they may not be same.\nExample 14  If 1 0A0 1 = −   and 0 1B1 0 =  , then 0 1AB1 0 = − .\nand0 1BA1 0− =  .
