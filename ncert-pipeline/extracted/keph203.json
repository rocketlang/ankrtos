Table 10.3 lists measured specific\nheat capacity of some substances at atmospheric\npressure and ordinary temperature while Table\n10.4 lists molar specific heat capacities of some\ngases. From Table 10.3 you can note that water\nReprint 2025-26\n\nTHERMAL PROPER TIES OF MA TTER 209⊳has the highest specific heat capacity compared\nto other substances. For this reason water is also\nused as a coolant in automobile radiators, as\nwell as, a heater in hot water bags. Owing to its\nhigh specific heat capacity, water warms up\nmore slowly than land during summer , and\nconsequently wind from the sea has a cooling\neffect. Now, you can tell why in desert ar eas,\nthe earth sur face war ms up quickly during the\nday and cools quickly at night.\nTable 10.4 Molar specific heat capacities of\nsome gases\nGas Cp (J mol–1K–1) Cv(J mol–1K–1)\nHe 20.8 12.5\nH228.8 20.4\nN229.1 20.8\nO229.4 21.1\nCO237.0 28.5\n10.7  CALORIMETRY\nA system is said to be isolated if no exchange or\ntransfer of heat occurs between the system and\nits surr oundings. When dif ferent parts of an\nisolated system ar e at dif ferent temperature, a\nquantity of heat transfers fr om the part at higher\ntemperatur e to the part at lower temperatur e.\nThe heat lost by the part at higher temperatur e\nis equal to the heat gained by the part at lower\ntemperatur e.\nCalorimetry means measur ement of heat.\nWhen a body at higher temperatur e is br\nought\nin contact with another body at lower\ntemperature, the heat lost by the hot body isequal to the heat gained by the colder body,\nprovided no heat is allowed to escape to the\nsurroundings. A device in which heat\nmeasurement can be done is called a\ncalorimeter . It consists of a metallic vessel and\nstirrer of the same material, like copper or\naluminium. The vessel is kept inside a wooden\njacket, which contains heat insulating material,\nlike glass wool etc. The outer jacket acts as a\nheat shield and reduces the heat loss from the\ninner vessel. There is an opening in the outer\njacket through which a mercury thermometer\ncan be inserted into the calorimeter (Fig. 10.20).\nThe following example provides a method by\nwhich the specific heat capacity of a given solid\ncan be determinated by using the principle, heat\ngained is equal to the heat lost.\nExample 10.3  A sphere of 0.047 kg\naluminium is placed for sufficient time in a\nvessel containing boiling water , so that the\nsphere is at 100 °C. It is then immediately\ntransfer ed to 0.14 kg copper calorimeter\ncontaining 0.25 kg water at 20  °C. The\ntemperature of water rises and attains a\nsteady state at 23 °C. Calculate the specific\nheat capacity of aluminium.\nAnswer   In solving this example, we shall use\nthe fact that at a steady  state, heat given by an\naluminium sphere will be equal to the heat\nabsorbed by the water and calorimeter .\nMass of aluminium sphere ( m1) = 0.047 kg\nInitial temperature  of aluminium  spher e = 100 °C\nFinal temperature = 23 °C\nChange in temperature  (∆T)=(100 °C-23 °C)= 77 °C\nLet specific heat capacity of aluminium be sAl.Table 10.3 Specific heat capacity of some substances at room temperature and atmospheric\npressure\nSubstance Specific heat capacity Substance Specific heat capacity\n (J kg–1 K–1) (J kg–1 K–1)\nAluminium 900.0 Ice 2060\nCarbon 506.5 Glass 840\nCopper 386.4 Iron 450\nLead 127.7 Kerosene 2118\nSilver 236.1 Edible oil 1965\nTungesten 134.4 Mercury 140\nWater 4186.0\nReprint 2025-26\n\n210 PHYSICS\nThe amount of heat lost by the aluminium\nsphere =  ∆ = × × °1 0.047kg 77 CAl Al m s T s\nMass of water (m2) = 0.25 kg\nMass of calorimeter ( m3) = 0.14 kg\nInitial temperature of water and calorimete r=20 °C\nFinal temperature  of the mixture = 23 °C\nChange in temperature  (∆T2) = 23 °C – 20 °C = 3 °C\nSpecific heat capacity of water ( sw)\n= 4.18 × 103 J kg–1  K–1\nSpecific heat capacity of copper calorimeter\n= 0.386  × 103 J kg–1  K–1\nThe amount of heat gained by water and\ncalorimeter = m2 sw ∆T2 + m3scu∆T2\n= (m2sw + m3scu) (∆T2)\n= (0.25 kg  × 4.18  × 103 J kg–1  K–1 + 0.14 kg  ×\n0.386  × 103 J kg–1  K–1) (23 °C – 20  °C)\nIn the steady state heat lost by the aluminium\nsphere = heat gained by water + heat gained by\ncalorimeter .\nSo, 0.047 kg  × sAl × 77 °C\n= (0.25 kg × 4.18  × 103 J kg–1  K–1+ 0.14 kg\n ×\n0.386  × 103 J kg–1  K–1)(3 °C)\nsAl = 0.911 kJ kg–1 K–1⊳\n10.8  CHANGE OF STATE\nMatter normally exists in three states: solid,\nliquid and gas. A transition from one of these\nstates to another is called a change of state. Two\ncommon changes of states ar e solid to liquid\nand liquid to gas (and, vice versa). These changes\ncan occur when the exchange of heat takes place\nbetween the substance and its surr oundings.\nTo study the change of state on heating or\ncooling, let us per form the following activity.\nTake some cubes of ice in a beaker . Note the\ntemperature of ice. Start heating it slowly on a\nconstant heat source. Note the temperature after\nevery  minute.  Continuously stir the mixture of\nwater and ice. Draw a graph between\ntemperatur e and time (Fig. 10.9). Y ou will observe\nno change in the temperature as long as there\nis ice in the beaker . In the above pr ocess, the\ntemperature of the system does not change even\nthough heat is being continuously supplied. The\nheat supplied  is being utilised in changing the\nstate from solid (ice) to liquid (water).Fig. 10.9 A plot of temperature versus time showing\nthe changes in the state of ice on heating\n(not to scale).\nThe change of state from solid to liquid is called\nmelting  or fusion and from liquid to solid is called\nfreezing . It is observed that the temperature\nremains constant until the entire amount of the\nsolid substance melts. That is, both the solid and\nthe liquid states of the substance coexist in\nthermal equilibrium during the change of\nstates from solid to liquid.  The temperature at\nwhich the solid and the liquid states of the\nsubstance is in thermal equilibrium with each\nother is called its melting point . It is\ncharacteristic of the substance. It also depends\non pressure. The melting point of a substance\nat standard atomspheric pressure is called its\nnormal melting point . Let us do the following\nactivity to understand the process of melting\nof ice.\nTake a slab of ice. T ake a metallic wir e and\nfix two blocks, say 5 kg each, at its ends. Put\nthe wire over the slab as shown in Fig. 10.10.\nYou will observe that the wir e passes thr ough\nthe ice slab. This happens due to the fact that\njust below the wir e, ice melts at lower\ntemperature due to incr ease in pr essur e. When\nthe wir e has passed, water above the wir e freezes\nagain. Thus, the wire passes through the slab\nand the slab does not split. This phenomenon\nof refreezing is called regelation . Skating is\npossible on snow due to the formation of water\nunder the skates. W ater is for med due to the\nincrease of pressure and it acts as a\nlubricant.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nTHERMAL PROPER TIES OF MA TTER 211\nFig. 10.10\nAfter the whole of ice gets converted into water\nand as we continue further heating, we shall see\nthat temperature begins to rise (Fig.10.9). The\ntemperature keeps on rising till it reaches nearly100 °C when it again becomes steady. The heat\nsupplied is now being utilised to change water\nfrom liquid state to vapour or  gaseous state.\nThe change of state from liquid to vapour (or\ngas) is called vaporisation . It is observed that\nthe temperatur e remains constant until the\nentire amount of the liquid is converted into\nvapour . That is, both the liquid and vapour states\nof the substance coexist in ther mal equilibrium,\nduring the change of state fr om liquid to vapour .\nThe temperatur e at which the liquid and the\nvapour states of the substance coexist is called\nits boiling point . Let us do the following activity\nto understand the pr ocess of boiling of water .\nTake a r ound-bottom flask, mor e than half\nfilled with water . Keep it over a bur ner and fix a\nTriple Point\nThe temperatur e of a substance r emains constant during its change of state (phase change).\nA graph between the temperatur e T and the Pr essur e P of the substance is called a phase\ndiagram or P – T diagram. The following figur e shows the phase diagram of water and CO2.\nSuch a phase diagram divides the P – T plane into a solid-r egion, the vapour -region and the\nliquid-r egion. The r egions ar e separated by the curves such as sublimation curve (BO), fusion\ncurve (AO) and vaporisation curve  (CO). The points on sublimation curve  represent states\nin which solid and vapour phases coexist. The point on the sublimation curve BO r epresent\nstates in which the solid and vapour phases co-exist. Points on the fusion curve AO r epresent\nstates in which solid and liquid phase coexist. Points on the vapourisation curve CO r epresent\nstates in which the liquid and vapour phases coexist. The temperatur e and pr essur e at which\nthe fusion curve, the vaporisation curve and the sublimation curve meet and all the thr ee\nphases of  a substance coexist is called the triple point  of the substance. For example the\ntriple point of water is represented by the temperature 273.16 K and pressure 6.1 1×10–3 Pa.\n(a) (b)\nFigure :   Pressure-temperature phase diagrams for (a) water and (b) CO2 (not to the scale).\nReprint 2025-26\n\n212 PHYSICS\nthermometer and steam outlet through the cork\nof the flask (Fig. 10.11). As water gets heated in\nthe flask, note first that the air , which was\ndissolved in the water , will come out as small\nbubbles. Later , bubbles of steam will for m at\nthe bottom but as they rise to the cooler water\nnear the top, they condense and disappear .\nFinally, as the temperatur e of the entir e mass\nof the water reaches 100  °C, bubbles of steam\nreach the sur face and boiling is said to occur .\nThe steam in the flask may not be visible but as\nit comes out of the flask, it condenses as tiny\ndroplets of water , giving a foggy appearance.\nFig. 10.11  Boiling process.\nIf now the steam outlet is closed for a few\nseconds to incr ease the pr essur e in the flask,\nyou will notice that boiling stops. Mor e heat\nwould be r equired to raise the temperatur e\n(depending on the incr ease in pressur e) before\nboiling begins again. Thus boiling point incr eases\nwith increase in pr essur e.\nLet us now remove the bur ner. Allow water to\ncool to about 80  °C. Remove the thermometer and\nsteam outlet. Close the flask with the airtightcork. Keep the flask turned upside down on the\nstand. Pour ice-cold water on the flask. W ater\nvapours in the flask condense r educing the\npressur e on the water sur face inside the flask.\nWater begins to boil again, now at a lower\ntemperature. Thus boiling point decr eases with\ndecrease in pr essur e.\nThis explains why cooking is difficult on hills.\nAt high altitudes, atmospheric pr essur e is lower ,\nreducing the boiling point of water as compar ed\nto that at sea level. On the other hand, boiling\npoint is incr eased inside a pr essur e cooker by\nincreasing the pr essur e. Hence cooking is faster .\nThe boiling point of a substance at standar d\natmospheric pr essur e is called its normal\nboiling point.\nHowever , all substances do not pass thr ough\nthe thr ee states: solid-liquid-gas. Ther e are\ncertain substances which nor mally pass fr om\nthe solid to the vapour state dir ectly and vice\nversa. The change fr om solid state to vapour\nstate without passing thr ough the liquid state\nis called sublimation , and the substance is said\nto sublime. Dry ice (solid CO2) sublimes, so also\niodine. During the sublimation pr ocess both the\nsolid and vapour states of a substance coexist\nin thermal equilibrium.\n10.8.1  Latent Heat\nIn Section 10.8, we have learnt that certain\namount of heat ener gy is transferred between a\nsubstance and its surr oundings when it\nunder goes a change of state. The amount of heat\nper unit mass transferr ed during change of state\nof the substance is called latent heat of the\nsubstance for the pr ocess. For example, if heat\nis added to a given quantity of ice at –10  °C, the\ntemperature of ice incr eases until it r eaches its\nmelting point (0  °C). At this temperature, the\naddition of mor e heat does not incr ease the\ntemperatur e but causes the ice to melt, or\nchanges its state. Once the entir e ice melts,\nadding mor e heat will cause the temperatur e of\nthe water to rise. A similar situation\noccurs during liquid gas change of state at the\nboiling point. Adding mor e heat to boiling water\ncauses vaporisation, without increase in\ntemperature.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nTHERMAL PROPER TIES OF MA TTER 213⊳The heat required during a change of state\ndepends upon the heat of transformation and\nthe mass of the substance under going a change\nof state. Thus, if mass m of a substance\nunder goes a change fr om one state to the other ,\nthen the quantity of heat r equir ed is given by\nQ = m L\norL = Q/m (10.13)\nwhere L is known as latent heat and is a\ncharacteristic of the substance. Its SI unit is\nJ kg–1. The value of L also depends on the\npressur e. Its value is usually quoted at standar d\natmospheric pr essur e. The latent heat for a solid-\nliquid state change is called the latent heat of\nfusion  (Lf), and that for a liquid-gas state change\nis called the latent heat of vaporisation  (Lv).\nThese ar e often r eferred to as the heat of fusion\nand the heat of vaporisation. A plot of\ntemperature versus heat  for a quantity of water\nis shown in Fig. 10.12. The latent heats of some\nsubstances, their freezing and boiling points, are\ngiven in Table 10.5.\nFig. 10.12 Temperature versus heat for water at\n1 atm pr essur e (not to scale).Note that when heat is added (or removed)\nduring a change of state, the temperature\nremains constant. Note in Fig. 10.12 that the\nslopes of the phase lines ar e not all the same,\nwhich indicate that specific heats of the various\nstates ar e not equal. For water , the latent heat of\nfusion and vapori sation are Lf = 3.33  × 105 J kg–1\nand Lv = 22.6 × 105 J kg–1, respectively. That is,\n3.33  × 105 J of heat is needed to melt 1 kg ice at\n0 °C, and 22.6  × 105 J of heat is needed to convert\n1 kg  water into steam at 100 °C. So, steam at\n100 °C carries  22.6  × 105 J  kg–1 more heat than\nwater at 100 °C. This is why burns from steam\nare usually more serious than those from\nboiling water .\nExample 10.4  When 0.15 kg of ice at 0  °C\nis mixed with 0.30 kg of water at 50 °C in a\ncontainer , the r esulting temperatur e is\n6.7 °C. Calculate the heat of fusion of ice.\n(swater = 4186 J kg–1 K–1)\nAnswer\nHeat lost by water = msw (θf–θi)w\n= (0.30 k g) (4186 J kg–1 K–1) (50.0  °C – 6.7  °C)\n= 54376.14 J\nHeat r equir ed to melt ice = m2Lf = (0.15 k g) Lf\nHeat r equir ed to raise temperatur e of ice\nwater to final temperatur e = mIsw (θf–θi)I\n= (0.15 kg) (4186 J kg–1 K–1) (6.7  °C – 0 °C)\n= 4206.93 J\nHeat lost = heat gained\n54376.14 J = (0.15 k g) Lf + 4206.93 J\nLf = 3.34×105 J kg–1. ⊳Table 10.5 Temperatures of the change of state and latent heats for various substances at\n1 atm pressure\nSubstance Melting LfBoiling Lv\nPoint (°C) (105J kg–1) Point (°C) (105J kg–1)\nEthanol –114 1.0 78 8.5\nGold 1063 0.645 2660 15.8\nLead 328 0.25 1744 8.67\nMercury –39 0.12 357 2.7\nNitrogen –210 0.26 –196 2.0\nOxygen –219 0.14 –183 2.1\nWater 0 3.33 100 22.6\nReprint 2025-26\n\n214 PHYSICS⊳Example 10.5  Calculate the heat required\nto convert 3 kg of ice at –12  °C kept in a\ncalorimeter to steam at 100 °C at\natmospheric pressure.

What are the different\nways by which this energy transfer takes\nplace? There are three distinct modes of heat\ntransfer: conduction, convection and radiation\n(Fig. 10.13).\nFig. 10.13 Heating by conduction, convection and\nradiation.\n10.9.1  Conduction\nConduction is the mechanism of transfer of heat\nbetween two adjacent parts of a body because\nof their temperature difference. Suppose, one end\nof a metallic r od is put in a flame, the other end\nof the r od will soon be so hot that you cannot\nhold it by your bare hands. Here, heat transfer\ntakes place by conduction fr om the hot end of\nthe rod thr ough its dif ferent parts to the other\nend.  Gases are poor thermal conductors, while\nliquids have conductivities inter mediate between\nsolids and gases.\nHeat conduction may be described\nquantitatively as the time rate of heat flow in a\nmaterial for a given temperatur e difference.\nConsider a metallic bar of length L and uniform\ncross -section A with its two ends maintained at\ndifferent temperatures. This can be done, for\nexample, by putting the ends in ther mal contact\nwith large reservoirs at temperatures , say, TC and\nTD, respectively (Fig. 1 0.14). Let us assume the\nideal condition that the sides of the bar ar e fully\ninsulated so that no heat is exchanged between\nthe sides and the surr ounding s.\nAfter sometime, a steady state is reached; the\ntemperatur e of the bar decr eases unifor mly with\ndistance fr om TC to TD; (TC>TD). The r eservoir at\nC supplies heat at a constant rate, which\ntransfers through the bar and is given out at\nthe same rate to the reservoir at D. It is found\nReprint 2025-26\n\nTHERMAL PROPER TIES OF MA TTER 215⊳experimentally that in this steady state, the rate\nof flow of heat (or heat current) H is proportional\nto the temperature difference ( TC – TD) and the\narea of cross-section A and is inversely\nproportional to the length L :\nH = KA –C DT T\nL(10.14)\nThe constant of proportionality K is called the\nthermal conductivity  of the material. The\ngreater the value of K for a material, the mor e\nrapidly will it conduct heat. The SI unit of K\n is\nJ s–1 m–1 K–1 or W m–1 K–1. The thermal\nconductivities of various substances ar e listed\nin Table 10.6. These values vary slightly with\ntemperatur e, but can be consider ed to be\nconstant over a nor mal temperatur e range.\nCompar e the r elatively lar ge ther mal\nconductivities of  good thermal conductors and,\nmetals, with the relatively small thermal\nconductivities of some good ther mal insulators,\nsuch as wood and glass wool. Y ou may have\nnoticed that some cooking pots have copper\ncoating on the bottom. Being a good conductor\nof heat, copper pr omotes the distribution of heat\nover the bottom of a pot for unifor m cooking.\nPlastic foams, on the other hand, ar e good\ninsulators, mainly because they contain pockets\nof air . Recall that gases ar e poor conductors,\nand note the low ther mal conductivity of air in\nthe Table 10.5. Heat retention and transfer are\nimportant in many other applications. Houses\nmade of concr ete r oofs get very hot during\nsummer days because thermal conductivity of\nconcr ete (though much smaller than that of a\nmetal) is still not small enough. Therefore, people,\nusually, prefer to give a layer of earth or foam\ninsulation on the ceiling so that heat transfer isprohibited and keeps the r oom cooler . In some\nsituations, heat transfer is critical. In a nuclear\nreactor , for example, elaborate heat transfer\nsystems need to be installed so that the\nenormous ener gy pr oduced by nuclear fission\nin the core transits out suf ficiently fast, thus\npreventing the cor e from over heating.\nTable 10.6 Thermal conductivities of some\n      material\nMaterial Thermal conductivity\n(J s–1 m–1 K–1 )\nMetals\nSilver 406\nCopper 385\nAluminium 205\nBrass 109\nSteel 50.2\nLead 34.7\nMercury 8.3\nNon-metals\nInsulating brick 0.15\nConcr ete 0.8\nBody fat 0.20\nFelt 0.04\nGlass 0.8\nIce 1.6\nGlass wool 0.04\nWood 0.12\nWater 0.8\nGases\nAir 0.024\nArgon 0.016\nHydrogen 0.14\nExample 10.6  What is the temperature of\nthe steel-copper junction in the steady\nstate of the system shown in Fig. 10.15.\nLength of the steel r od = 15.0 cm, length\nof the copper r od = 10.0 cm, temperatur e\nof the furnace = 300  °C, temperature of the\nother end = 0  °C.

Consider any cr oss section of the r od.\nIn the steady state, heat flowing into the element\nmust equal the heat flowing out of it; otherwise\nthere would be a net gain or loss of heat by the\nelement and its temperatur e would not be\nsteady.

It is  possible only in fluids.\nConvection can be natural or for ced. In natural\nconvection, gravity plays an important part.\nWhen a fluid is heated fr om below, the hot part\nexpands and, ther efore, becomes less dense.\nBecause of buoyancy, it rises and the upper\ncolder part r eplaces it. This again gets heated,\nrises up and is replaced by the relatively colder\npart of the fluid. The process goes on. This mode\nof heat transfer is evidently different from\nconduction. Convection involves bulk transport\nof different parts of the fluid.\n     In forced convection, material is forced to move\nby a pump or by some other physical means. The\ncommon  examples of forced convection systems\nare forced-air heating systems in home, the\nhuman circulatory system, and the cooling\nsystem of an automobile engine. In the human\nbody, the heart acts as the pump that circulates\nblood through different parts of the body,\ntransferring heat by forced convection and\nmaintaining it at a uniform temperature.\nNatural convection is responsible for many\nfamiliar phenomena. During the day, the\nground heats up more quickly than large bodiesof water do . This occurs both because water has\na greater specific heat capacity and because\nmixing currents disperse the absorbed heat\nthroughout the gr eat volume of water . The air\nin contact with the warm ground is heated by\nconduction. It expands, becoming less dense\nthan the surr ounding cooler air . As a r esult, the\nwarm air rises (air currents) and the other air\nmoves (winds) to fill the space-creating a sea\nbreeze near a lar ge body of water . Cooler air\ndescends, and a thermal convection cycle is set\nup, which transfers heat away from the land.\nAt night, the ground loses its heat more quickly,\nand the water surface is warmer than the land.\nAs a result, the cycle is reveresed (Fig. 10.17).\nThe other example of natural convection is\nthe steady sur face wind on the earth blowing\nin from north-east towar ds the equator , the\nso-called trade wind. A resonable explanation\nis as follows: the equatorial and polar regions of\nthe earth receive unequal solar heat. Air at the\nearth’s surface near the equator is hot, while\nthe air in the upper atmospher e of the poles is\ncool. In the absence of any other factor , a\nconvection curr ent would be set up, with the\nair at the equatorial sur face rising and moving\nout towar ds the poles, descending and\nstreaming in towar ds the equator . The r otation\nof the earth, however , modifies this convection\ncurrent. Because of this, air close to the equator\nhas an eastward speed of 1600 km/h, while it\nis zer o close to the poles. As a r esult, the air\ndescends not at the poles but at 30° N (North)\nlatitude and r eturns to the equator . This is\ncalled trade wind .\nFig. 10.17 Convection cycles.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n218 PHYSICS\n10.9.3  Radiation\nConduction and convection require some\nmaterial as a transport medium. These modes\nof heat transfer cannot operate between bodies\nseparated by a distance in vacuum. But the\nearth does receive heat from the Sun across a\nhuge distance. Similarly, we quickly feel the\nwarmth of the fire nearby even though air\nconducts poorly and before convection takes\nsome time to set in. The third mechanism for\nheat transfer needs no medium; it is called\nradiation and the energy so transferred by\nelectromagnetic waves is called radiant energy.\nIn an electromagnetic wave, electric and\nmagnetic fields oscillate in space and time. Like\nany wave, electromagnetic waves can have\ndifferent wavelengths and can travel in vacuum\nwith the same speed, namely the speed of light\ni.e., 3 × 108 m s–1 . You will lear n these matters in\nmore detail later , but you now know why heat\ntransfer by radiation does not need any medium\nand why it is so fast. This is how heat is\ntransferred to the earth from the Sun through\nempty space. All bodies emit radiant energy,\nwhether they are solid, liquid or gas. The\nelectromagnetic radiation emitted by a body by\nvirtue of its temperature, like radiation by a red\nhot iron or light from a filament lamp is called\nthermal radiation.\nWhen this ther mal radiation falls on other\nbodies, it is partly r eflected and partly absorbed.\nThe amount of heat that a body can absorb by\nradiation depends on the colour of the body.\nWe find that black bodies absorb and emit\nradiant energy better than  bodies of lighter\ncolours. This fact finds many applications in our\ndaily life. W e wear white or light colour ed clothes\nin summer , so that they absorb the least heat\nfrom the Sun. However , during winter , we use\ndark coloured clothes , which absorb heat from\nthe sun and keep our body warm. The bottoms of\nutensils for cooking food are blackened so that\nthey absorb maximum heat from fire and transfer\nit to the vegetables to be cooked.\nSimilarly, a Dewar flask or thermos bottle is\na device to minimise heat transfer between the\ncontents of the bottle and outside. It consists\nof a double-walled glass vessel with the inner\nand outer walls coated with silver . Radiation\nfrom the inner wall is reflected back to thecontents of the bottle. The outer wall similarly\nreflects back any incoming radiation. The space\nbetween the walls is evacuted to r educe\nconduction and convection losses and the flask\nis supported on an insulator , like cork. The\ndevice is, ther efore, useful for pr eventing hot\ncontents (like, milk) from getting cold, or\nalternatively, to store cold contents (like, ice).\n10.9.4 Blackbody Radiation\nWe have so far not mentioned the wavelength\ncontent of thermal radiation. The important\nthing about thermal radiation at any\ntemperature is that it is not of one (or a few)\nwavelength(s) but has a continuous spectrum\nfrom the small to the long wavelengths. The\nenergy content of radiation, however , varies for\ndifferent wavelengths. Figure 10.18 gives the\nexperimental curves for radiation energy per unit\narea per unit wavelength emitted by a blackbody\nversus wavelength for different temperatures.\nFig. 10.18:   Energy emitted versus wavelength\nfor a blackbody at different\ntemperatures\nNotice that the wavelength λm for which energy\nis the maximum decreases with increasing\ntemperature. The relation between λm and T is\ngiven by what is known as Wien’s Displacement\nLaw:\nλm T  =  constant (10.15)\nThe value of the constant (Wien’s constant)\nis 2.9 × 10–3 m K. This law explains why the\ncolour of a piece of iron heated in a hot flame\nfirst becomes dull red, then reddish yellow, and\nfinally white hot. Wien’s law is useful for\nestimating the surface temperatures of celestial\nReprint 2025-26\n\nTHERMAL PROPER TIES OF MA TTER 219\nbodies like, the moon, Sun and other stars. Light\nfrom the moon is found to have a maximum\nintensity near the wavelength 14 µm. By Wien’s\nlaw, the surface of the moon is estimated to have\na temperature of 200 K. Solar radiation has a\nmaximum at λm = 4753 Å. This corresponds to\nT = 6060 K. Remember , this is the temperatur e\nof the sur face of the sun, not its interior .\nThe most significant feature of the\nblackbody radiation curves in Fig. 10.18  is that\nthey are universal . They depend only on the\ntemperature and not on the size, shape or\nmaterial of the blackbody. Attempts to explain\nblackbody radiation theoretically, at the\nbeginning of the twentieth century, spurred the\nquantum revolution in physics, as you will\nlearn in later courses.\nEnergy can be transferred by radiation over\nlarge distances, without a medium (i.e. , in\nvacuum). The total electromagnetic energy\nradiated by a body at absolute temperature T\nis proportional to its size, its ability to radiate\n(called emissivity)  and most importantly to its\ntemperature. For a body , which is a perfect\nradiator , the ener gy emitted per unit time ( H)\nis given by\nH = AσT4(10.16)\nwhere A is the area and T is the absolute\ntemperature of the body.  This relation obtained\nexperimentally by Stefan and later proved\ntheoretically by Boltzmann is known as Stefan-\nBoltzmann law  and the constant σ is called\nStefan-Boltzmann constant. Its value in SI units\nis 5.67 × 10–8 W m–2 K–4. Most bodies emit only a\nfraction of the rate given by Eq. 10.16 . A substance\nlike lamp black comes close to the limit. One,\ntherefore, defines a dimensionless fraction e\ncalled emissivity  and writes,\nH = AeσT4(10.17)\nHere, e = 1 for a per fect radiator . For a tungsten\nlamp, for example, e is about 0.4. Thus , a tungsten\nlamp at a temperature of 3000 K and a surface\narea of 0.3 cm2 radiates at the rate  H = 0.3 ×\n10–4 × 0.4 × 5.67 × 10–8 × (3000)4 = 60 W .\nA body at temperature T, with surroundings\nat temperatures Ts, emits, as well as, receives\nenergy. For a per fect radiator , the net rate of\nloss of radiant energy is\nH = σA (T4 – Ts4)For a body with emissivity e, the relation\nmodifies to\nH = eσ A (T4 – Ts4) (10.18)\nAs an example, let us estimate the heat\nradiated by our bodies. Suppose the surface area\nof a person’s body is about 1.9 m2 and the room\ntemperature is 22 °C. The internal body\ntemperature, as we know, is about 37  °°C.  The\nskin temperature may be 28° °C (say). The\nemissivity of the skin is about 0.97 for the\nrelevant region of electromagnetic radiation. The\nrate of heat loss is:\nH = 5.67 × 10–8 × 1.9 × 0.97 × {(301)4 – (295)4}\n =66.4 W\nwhich is more than half the rate of energy\nproduction by the body at rest (120 W). To\nprevent this heat loss effectively (better than\nordinary clothing), modern arctic clothing has\nan additional thin shiny metallic layer next to\nthe skin, which reflects the body’s radiation.\n10.10  NEWTON’S LAW OF COOLING\nWe all know that hot water or milk when left on\na table begins to cool, gradually. Ultimately it\nattains the temperature of the surroundings. To\nstudy how slow or fast a given body can cool on\nexchanging heat with its surroundings, let us\nperform the following activity.\nTake some water , say 300 mL, in a\ncalorimeter with a stirrer and cover it with a\ntwo-holed lid. Fix the stirrer through one hole\nand fix a thermometer through another hole\nin the lid and make sure that the bulb of\nthermometer is immersed in the water . Note\nthe r eading of the ther mometer . This r eading\nT1 is the temperature of the surroundings.\nHeat the water kept in the calorimeter till it\nattains a temperature, say 40  °C above room\ntemperature (i.e., temperature of the\nsurroundings). Then, stop heating the water\nby removing the heat source. Start the\nstop-watch and note the reading of the\nthermometer after a fixed interval of time, say\nafter every one minute of stirring gently with\nthe stirr er. Continue to note the temperatur e\n(T2) of water till it attains a temperature about\n5 °C above that of the surroundings. Then, plot\nReprint 2025-26\n\n220 PHYSICS\na graph by taking each value of temperature\n∆T = T2 – T1 along y-axis and the coresponding\nvalue of  t along x-axis (Fig. 10.19).\nFig. 10.19 Curve showing cooling of hot water\nwith time.\nFrom the graph you can infer how the cooling\nof hot water depends on the difference of its\ntemperatur e from that of the surr oundings. Y ou\nwill also notice that initially the rate of cooling\nis higher and decreases as the temperature of\nthe body falls.\nThe above activity shows that a hot body loses\nheat to its surroundings in the form of heat\nradiation. The rate of loss of heat depends on\nthe difference in temperature between the body\nand its surroundings. Newton was the first to\nstudy, in a systematic manner , the r elation\nbetween the heat lost by a body in a given\nenclosure and its temperature.\nAccording to Newton’s law of cooling, the rate\nof loss of heat, – d Q/dt of the body is directly\nproportional to the difference of temperature\n∆T = (T2–T1) of the body and the surr oundings.\nThe law holds good only for small dif ference of\ntemperatur e. Also, the loss of  heat by radiation\ndepends upon the natur e of the sur face of the\nbody and the ar ea of the exposed sur face. W e\ncan write\n– (10.19)\nwhere k is a positive constant depending upon\nthe ar ea and natur e of the sur face of the body.\nSuppose a body of mass m and specific heat\ncapacity s is at temperatur e T2. Let T1 be the\ntemperatur e of the surr oundings. If the\ntemperature falls by a small amount d T2 in time\ndt, then the amount of heat lost is\ndQ = \nms dT2\n∴ Rate of loss of heat is given by\ndQ\ndtmsdT\ndt=2(10.20)From Eqs. (10.15) and (10.16) we have\n– ( – ) m sdT\ndtk T T2\n2 1=\ndT\nT Tk\nmsdt K dt2\n2 1–– –= =(10.21)\nwhere K = k/m s\nOn integrating,\nloge (T2 – T1) = – K t + c (10.22)\nor T2 = T1 + C′ e–Kt; where C′ = ec(10.23)\nEquation (10.23) enables you to calculate the\ntime of cooling of a body through a particular\nrange of temperature.\nFor small temperature differences, the rate\nof cooling, due to conduction, convection, and\nradiation combined, is proportional to the\ndifference in temperature. It is a valid\napproximation in the transfer of heat from a\nradiator to a room, the loss of heat through the\nwall of a room, or the cooling of a cup of tea on\nthe table.\nFig. 10.20  Verification of Newton’s Law of cooling.\nNewton’s law of cooling can be verified with\nthe help of the experimental set-up shown in\nFig. 10.20(a). The set-up consists of a double-\nwalled vessel (V) containing water  between\nthe two walls. A copper calorimeter (C)\ncontaining hot water is placed inside the\ndouble-walled vessel. Two thermometers\nthrough the corks are used to note the\ntemperatures T2 of water in calorimeter and\nT1 of hot water in between the double walls,\nrespectively. Temperature of hot water in the\ncalorimeter is noted after equal intervals of\ntime. A graph is plotted between lo ge (T2–T1)\n[or ln(T2–T1)] and time ( t). The nature of the∆\nReprint 2025-26\n\nTHERMAL PROPER TIES OF MA TTER 221⊳graph is observed to be a straight line having\na negative slope as shown in Fig. 10.20(b). This\nis in support of Eq. 10.22.\nExample 10.8   A pan filled with hot food\ncools from 94  °C to 86 °C in 2 minutes when\nthe room temperature is at 20 °C.

W ith this choice, the Celsius temperatur e of the melting point of water and\nboiling point of water (both at 1 atm pr essur e) are very close to, but not exactly equal\nto 0  °C and 100 °C respectively.  In the original Celsius scale, these latter fixed points\nwere exactly at 0  °C and 100  °C (by choice), but now the triple point of water is the\npreferred choice for the fixed point, because it has a unique temperatur e.\n2.A liquid in equilibrium with vapour has the same pr essur e and temperatur e throughout\nthe system; the two phases in equilibrium dif fer in their molar volume (i.e. density).\nThis is true for a system with any number of phases in equilibrium.\n3.Heat transfer always involves temperatur e difference between two systems or two parts\nof the same system.
