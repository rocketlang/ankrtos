We know that a\nrelation in a set A is a subset of A × A. Thus, the empty set φ and A × A are two\nextreme relations. For illustration, consider a relation R in the set A = {1, 2, 3, 4}  given by\nR = {( a, b): a – \nb = 10}. This is the empty set, as no pair ( a, b) satisfies the condition\na – b = 10. Similarly , R′ = {( a, b) : | a – b | ≥ 0} is the whole set A × A, as all pairs\n(a, b) in A × A satisfy | a – b | ≥ 0. These two extreme examples lead us to the\nfollowing definitions.\nDefinition 1 A  relation R in a set A is called empty r elation, if no element of A is\nrelated to any element of A, i.e., R = φ ⊂ A  × A.\nDefinition 2  A relation R in a set A is called universal r elation , if each element of A\nis related to every element of A, i.e., R = A × A.\nBoth the empty relation and the universal relation are some times called trivial\nrelations .\nExample 1  Let A be the set of all students of a boys school. Show that the relation R\nin A given by R = {( a, b) : a is sister of b} is the empty relation and R ′ = {( a, b) : the\ndifference between heights of a and b is less than 3 meters} is the universal relation.\nSolution\n Since the school is boys school, no student of the school can be sister of any\nstudent of the school. Hence, R = φ, showing that R is the empty relation. It is also\nobvious that the difference between heights of any two students of the school has to be\nless than 3 meters. This shows that R ′ = A × A is the universal relation.\nRemark  In Class XI, we have seen two ways of representing a relation, namely raster\nmethod and set builder method. However , a relation R in the set {1, 2, 3, 4}  defined by R\n= {( a, b) : b = a + 1} is also expressed as a R b if and only if\nb = a + 1 by many authors. We may also use this notation, as and when convenient.\nIf (a, b) ∈ R, we say that a is related to b and we denote it as a R b.\nOne of the most important relation, which plays a significant role in Mathematics,\nis an  equivalence r elation . To study equivalence relation, we first consider three\ntypes of relations, namely reflexive, symmetric and transitive.\nDefinition 3  A relation R in a set A is called\n(i)reflexive , if (a, a) ∈ R, for every a ∈ A,\n(ii) symmetric , if (a1, a2) ∈ R implies that ( a2, a1) ∈ R, for all a1, a2 ∈ A.\n(iii) transitive , if (a1, a2) ∈ R and ( a2, a3) ∈ R implies that ( a1, a3) ∈ R, for all a1, a2,\na3 ∈ A.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nRELA TIONS AND FUNCTIONS 3\nDefinition 4 A relation R in a set A is said to be an equivalence r elation  if R is\nreflexive, symmetric and transitive.\nExample 2  Let T be the set of all triangles in a plane with R a relation in T given by\nR = {(T1, T2) : T1 is congruent to T2}. Show that R is an equivalence relation.\nSolution  R is reflexive, since every triangle is congruent to itself. Further ,\n(T1, T2) ∈ R ⇒ T1 is congruent to T2 ⇒ T2 is congruent to T1 ⇒ (T2, T1) ∈ R. Hence,\nR is symmetric. Moreover , (T1, T2), (T2, T3) ∈ R ⇒ \nT1 is  congruent to T2 and T2 is\ncongruent to T3 ⇒ T1 is congruent to T3 ⇒ (T1, T3) ∈ R. Therefore, R is an equivalence\nrelation.\nExample 3 Let L be the set of all lines in a plane and R be the relation in L defined as\nR = {(L1, L2) : L1 is perpendicular to L2}. Show that R is symmetric but neither\nreflexive nor transitive.\nSolution  R is not reflexive, as a line L1 can not be perpendicular to itself, i.e., (L1, L1)\n∉ R. R is symmetric as (L1, L2) ∈ R\n⇒ L1 is perpendicular to L2\n⇒ L2 is perpendicular to L1\n⇒ (L2, L1) ∈ R.\nR is not transitive . Indeed, if L1 is perpendicular to L2 and\nL2 is perpendicular to L3, then L1 can never be perpendicular to\nL3. In fact, L1 is parallel to L3, i.e., (L1, L2) ∈ R, (L2, L3) ∈ R but (L1, L3) ∉ R.\nExample 4  Show that the relation R in the set {1, 2, 3} given by R = {(1, 1), (2, 2),\n(3, 3), (1, 2), (2, 3)} is reflexive but neither symmetric nor transitive.\nSolution\n R is reflexive, since (1, 1), (2, 2) and (3, 3) lie in R. Also, R is not symmetric,\nas (1, 2) ∈ R but (2, 1) ∉ R. Similarly , R is not transitive, as (1, 2) ∈ R and (2, 3) ∈ R\nbut (1, 3) ∉ R.\nExample 5  Show that the relation R in the set Z of integers given by\nR = {( a, b) : 2 divides a – b}\nis an equivalence relation.\nSolution R is reflexive, as 2 divides ( a – a) for all a ∈ Z. Further , if (a, b) ∈ R, then\n2 divides a – b. Therefore, 2 divides b – a. Hence, (b , a) ∈ R, which shows that R is\nsymmetric. Similarly , if (a, b) ∈ R and ( b, c) ∈ R, then a – b and b – c are divisible by\n",

      "content": "2. Now , a – c = (a – b) + (b – c) is even (Why?). So, ( a – c) is divisible by 2. This\nshows that R is transitive. Thus, R is an equivalence relation in Z.Fig 1.1\nReprint 2025-26\n\nMATHEMA TICS 4\nIn Example 5, note that all even integers are related to zero, as (0, ± 2), (0, ± 4)\netc., lie in R and no odd integer is related to 0, as (0, ± 1), (0, ± 3) etc., do not lie in R.\nSimilarly , all odd integers are related to one and no even integer is related to one.\nTherefore, the set E of all even integers and the set O of all odd integers are subsets of\nZ satisfying following conditions:\n(i)All elements of E are related to each other and all elements of O are related to\neach other .\n(ii) No element of E is related to any element of O and vice-versa.\n(iii) E and O are disjoint and Z = E ∪ O.\nThe subset E is called the equivalence class containing zer o and is denoted by\n[0]. Similarly , O is the equivalence class containing 1 and is denoted by [1]. Note that\n[0] ≠ [1], [0] = [2 r] and [1] = [2 r + 1], r ∈ Z. Infact, what we have seen above is true\nfor an arbitrary equivalence relation R in a set X. Given an arbitrary equivalence\nrelation R in an arbitrary set X, R divides X into mutually disjoint subsets Ai called\npartitions or subdivisions  of X satisfying:\n(i)all elements of Ai are related to each other , for all i.\n(ii) no element of Ai is related to any element of Aj, i ≠ j.\n(iii) ∪ Aj = X and Ai ∩ Aj = φ, i ≠ j.\nThe subsets Ai are called equivalence classes . The interesting part of the situation\nis that we can go reverse also. For example, consider a subdivision of the set Z given\nby three mutually disjoint subsets A1, A2 and A3 whose union is Z with\nA1 = {x ∈ Z : x is a multiple of 3} = {..., – 6, – 3, 0, 3, 6, ...}\nA2 = {x ∈ Z : x – 1 is a multiple of 3} = {..., – 5, – 2, 1, 4, 7, ...}\nA3 = {x ∈ Z : x – 2 is a multiple of 3} = {..., – 4, – 1, 2, 5, 8, ...}\nDefine a relation R in Z given by R = {( a, b) : 3 divides a – b}. Following the\narguments similar to those used in Example 5, we can show that R is an equivalence\nrelation. Also, A1 coincides with the set of all integers in Z which are related to zero, A2\ncoincides with the set of all integers which are related to 1 and A3 coincides with the\nset of all integers in Z which are related to 2. Thus, A1 = [0], A2 = [1] and A3 = [2].\nIn fact, A1 = [3 r], A2 = [3 r + 1] and A3 = [3 r + 2], for all r  ∈ Z.\nExample 6  Let R be the relation defined in the set A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} by\nR = {( a, b) : both a and b are either odd or even}. Show that R is an equivalence\nrelation. Further , show that all the elements of the subset {1, 3, 5, 7} are related to each\nother and all the elements of the subset {2, 4, 6} are related to each other , but no\nelement of the subset {1, 3, 5, 7} is related to any element of the subse t {2, 4, 6}.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nRELA TIONS AND FUNCTIONS 5\nSolution Given any element a in A, both a and a must be either odd or even, so\nthat (a, a) ∈ R. Further , (a, b) ∈ R ⇒ both a and b must be either o dd or even\n⇒ (b, a) ∈ R. Similarly , (a, b) ∈ R and (b, c) ∈ R ⇒ all elements a, b, c, must be\neither even or odd simultaneously ⇒ (a, c) ∈ R. Hence, R is an equivalence relation.\nFurther , all the elements of {1, 3, 5, 7} are related to each other , as all the elements\nof this subset are odd.

As the concept of function is of paramount importance in mathematics and\namong other  disciplines as well, we would like to extend our study about function from\nwhere we finished earlier . In this section, we would like to study dif ferent types of\nfunctions.\nConsider the functions  f1, f2, f3 and f4 given by the following diagrams.\nIn Fig 1.2, we observe that the images of distinct elements of X1 under the function\nf1 are distinct, but the image of two distinct elements 1 and 2 of X1 under f2 is same,\nnamely b. Further , there are some elements like e and f in X2 which are not images of\nany element of X1 under f1, while all elements of X3 are images of some elements of X1\nunder f3. The above observations lead to the following definitions:\nDefinition 5  A function f : X →  Y is defined to be one-one  (or injective ), if the images\nof distinct elements of X under f are distinct, i.e., for every x1, x2 ∈ X, f(x1) = f(x2)\nimplies x1 = x2. Otherwise, f is called many-one .\nThe function f1 and f4 in Fig 1.2 (i) and (iv) are one-one and the function f2 and f3\nin Fig 1.2 (ii) and (iii) are many-one.\nDefinition 6  A function f : X → Y is said to be onto (or surjective ), if every element\nof Y is the image of some element of X under f, i.e., for every y ∈ Y, there exists an\nelement x in X such that f(x) = y.\nThe function f3 and f4 in Fig 1.2 (iii), (iv) are onto and the function f1 in Fig 1.2 (i) is\nnot onto as elements e, f in X2 are not the image of any element in X1 under f1.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nMATHEMA TICS 8\nRemark  f : X → Y is onto if and only if Range of f = Y .\nDefinition 7  A function f : X → \nY is said to be one-one and onto  (or bijective ), if f is\nboth one-one and onto.\nThe function f4 in Fig 1.2 (iv) is one-one and onto.\nExample 7  Let A be the set of all 50 students of Class X in a school. Let f : A → N be\nfunction defined by f(x) = roll number of the student x. Show that f is one-one\nbut not onto.\nSolution No two dif ferent students of the class can have same roll number . Therefore,\nf must be one-one. We can assume without any loss of generality that roll numbers of\nstudents are from 1 to 50. This implies that 51 in N is not roll number of any student of\nthe class, so that 51 can not be image of any element of X under f. Hence , f is not onto.\nExample 8  Show that the function f : N → N, given by f(x) = 2 x, is one-one but not\nonto.\nSolution The function f is one-one, for f(x1) = f(x2) ⇒ 2x1 = 2x2 ⇒ x1 = x2. Further ,\nf is not onto, as for 1 ∈ N, there does not exist any x in N such that f(x) = 2 x = 1.Fig 1.2 (i) to (iv)\nReprint 2025-26\n\nRELA TIONS AND FUNCTIONS 9\nExample 9  Prove that the function f : R → R, given by f(x) = 2x, is one-one and onto.\nSolution   f is one-one, as f(x1) = f(x2) ⇒ 2x1 = 2x2 ⇒ x1 = x2. Also, given any real\nnumber y in R, there exists 2y in R such that f(2y) = 2 . (2y) = y. Hence , f is onto.\nFig 1.3\nExample 1 0  Show that the function f : N → N, given by f(1) = f(2) = 1 and f(x) = x – 1,\nfor every x > 2, is onto but not one-one.\nSolution  f is not one-one, as f(1) = f(2) = 1. But f is onto, as given any y ∈ N, y ≠ 1,\nwe can choose x as y + 1 such that f(y + 1) = y + 1 – 1 = y. Also for 1 ∈ N, we\nhave f(1) = 1.\nExample 1 1  Show that the function f : R → R,\ndefined as f(x) = x2, is neither one-one nor onto.\nSolution   Since f(– 1) = 1 = \nf(1), f is not one-\none. Also, the element – 2 in the co-domain R is\nnot image of any element x in the domain R\n(Why?). Therefore f is not onto.\nExample 12   Show that f : N → N, given by\n1,if is odd,( )1,if is evenx xf xx x+ = − \nis both one-one and onto. Fig 1.4\nReprint 2025-26\n\nMATHEMA TICS 10\nSolution  Suppose f (x1) = f(x2). Note that if x1 is odd and x2 is even, then we will have\nx1 + 1 = x2 – 1, i.e., x2 – x1 = 2 which is impossible. Similarly , the possibility of x1 being\neven and x2 being odd can also be ruled out, using the similar argument. Therefore,\nboth x1 and x2 must be either odd or even. Suppose both x1 and x2 are odd. Then\nf(x1) = f(x2) ⇒ \nx1 + 1 = x2 + 1 ⇒  x1 = x2. Similarly, if both x1 and x2 are even, then also\nf(x1) = f(x2) ⇒ x1 – 1 = x2 – 1 ⇒ x1 = x2. Thus, f is one-one. Also, any odd number\n2r + 1 in the co-domain N is the image of 2 r + 2 in the domain N and any even number\n2r in the co-domain N is the image of 2 r – 1 in the domain N. Thus, f is onto.\nExample 13 Show that an onto function f : {1, 2, 3} → {1, 2, 3} is always one-one.\nSolution Suppose f  is not one-one. Then there exists two elements, say 1 and 2 in the\ndomain whose image in the co-domain is same. Also, the image of 3 under f can be\nonly one element. Therefore, the range set can have at the most two elements of the\nco-domain {1, 2, 3}, showing that f  is not onto, a contradiction. Hence , f must be one-one.\nExample 14  Show that a one-one function f : {1, 2, 3} → {1, 2, 3} must be onto.\nSolution Since f is one-one, three elements of {1, 2, 3} must be taken to 3 different\nelements of the co-domain {1, 2, 3} under f. Hence, f has to be onto.\nRemark  The results mentioned in Examples 13 and 14 are also true for an arbitrary\nfinite set X, i.e., a one-one function f : X → X is necessarily onto and an onto map\nf : X → X is necessarily one-one, for every finite set X. In contrast to this, Examples 8\nand 10 show that for an infinite set, this may not be true. In fact, this is a characteristic\ndifference between a finite and an infinite set.\nEXERCISE 1.2\n1.Show that the function f : R∗ ∗∗ ∗∗ → R∗ ∗∗∗∗ defined by f(x) = 1\nx is one-one and onto,\nwhere R∗∗∗\n∗∗ is the set of all non-zero real numbers.

Then the composition of\nf and g, denoted by gof, is defined as the function gof : A\n → C given by\ngof(x) =g(f(x)), ∀ x ∈ A.\nFig 1.5\nExample 15  Let f : {2, 3, 4, 5} → {3, 4, 5, 9} and g : {3, 4, 5, 9} → {7, 1 1, 15} be\nfunctions defined as f(2) = 3, f(3) = 4, f(4) =  f(5) = 5 and g(3) = g (4) = 7 and\ng(5) =  g(9) = 1 1. Find gof.\nSolution  We have  gof(2) =  g(f(2)) = g(3) = 7, gof(3) =  g(f(3)) = g(4) = 7,\ngof(4) =  g(f(4)) = g(5) = 1 1 and gof(5) =  g(5) = 1 1.\nExample 1 6 Find gof and fog, if f : R → R and \ng : R → R are given by  f(x) = cos x\nand g(x) = 3 x2. Show that gof ≠ fog.\nSolution We have  gof(x) =  g(f(x)) = g(cos x) = 3 (cos x)2 = 3 cos2 x. Similarly ,\nfog(x) =  f(g(x)) =  f(3x2) = cos (3 x2). Note that 3cos2 x ≠ cos 3 x2, for x = 0. Hence,\ngof ≠ fog.\nDefinition 9  A function f : X → Y is defined to be inver tible, if there exists  a function\ng : Y → X such that  gof = IX and fog = IY. The function g is called the inverse of f   and\nis denoted by f–1.\nThus, if f is invertible, then f must be one-one and onto and conversely , if f is\none-one and onto, then f must be invertible. This fact significantly helps for proving a\nfunction \nf to be invertible by showing that f is one-one and onto, specially when the\nactual inverse of f is not to be determined.\nExample 17 Let f : N → Y be a function defined as f(x) = 4 x + 3, where ,\nY = { y ∈ N: y = 4x + 3 for some x  ∈ N}. Show that f is invertible. Find the inverse.\nSolution  Consider an arbitrary element y of Y. By the definition of Y, y = 4x + 3,\nfor some \nx in the domain N . This shows that ( 3)\n4yx−= . Define g : Y → N by\nReprint 2025-26\n\nRELA TIONS AND FUNCTIONS 13\n( 3)( )4yg y−= . Now , gof(x) = g(f(x)) = g(4x + 3) = (4 3 3)\n4xx+ −= and\nfog(y) = f(g(y)) = f( 3) 4 ( 3)34 4y y− − = +    = y – 3 + 3 = y. This shows that gof = IN\nand fog = IY, which implies that f is invertible and g is the inverse of f.\nMiscellaneous Examples\nExample 18  If R1 and R2 are equivalence relations in a set A, show that R1 ∩ R2 is\nalso an equivalence relation.\nSolution Since R1 and R2 are equivalence relation s, (a, a) ∈ R1, and ( a, a) ∈ R2 ∀a ∈ A.\nThis implies that (a, a) ∈ R1 ∩ R2, ∀a, showing R1 ∩ R2 is reflexive. Further ,\n(a, b) ∈ R1 ∩ R2 ⇒ (a, b) ∈ R1 and (a, b) ∈ R2 ⇒ (b, a) ∈ R1 and (b, a) ∈ R2 ⇒\n(b, a) ∈ R1 ∩ R2, hence, R1 ∩ R2 is symmetric. Similarly , (a, b) ∈ R1 ∩ R2 and\n(b, c) ∈ R1 ∩ R2 ⇒ (a, c) ∈ R1 and ( a, c) ∈ R2 ⇒ \n(a, c) ∈ R1 ∩ R2. This shows that\nR1 ∩ R2 is transitive. Thus, R1 ∩ R2 is an equiva lence relation.\nExample 19  Let R be a relation on the set A of ordered pairs of positive integers\ndefined by ( x, y) R (u, v) if  and only if xv = yu. Show that R is an equivalence relation.\nSolution Clearly , (x, y) R ( x, y), ∀(x, y) ∈ A, since xy = yx. This shows that R is\nreflexive. Further , (x, y) R (u, v) ⇒ xv = yu ⇒ uy = vx and hence ( u, v) R (x, y). This\nshows that R is symmetric. Similarly , (x, y) R (u, v) and ( u, v) R (a, b) ⇒ xv = yu and\nub = va ⇒ a axv yuu u= ⇒ b axv yuv u=  ⇒ xb = ya and hence ( x, y) R (a , b). Thus, R\nis transitive. Thus, R is an equivalence relation.\nExample 20  Let X = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. Let R1 be a relation in X given\nby R1 = {( x, y) : x – y is divisible by 3} and R2 be another relation on X given by\nR2 = {(x, y): {x, y} ⊂ {1, 4, 7}} or { x, y} ⊂ {2, 5, 8} or { x, y} ⊂ {3, 6, 9}}. Show that\nR1 = R2.\nSolution  Note that the characteristic of sets {1, 4, 7}, {2, 5, 8} and {3, 6, 9} is\nthat difference between any two elements of these sets is a multiple of 3. Therefore,\n(x, y) ∈ R1 ⇒ x – y is a multiple of 3 ⇒ {x, y} ⊂ {1, 4, 7} or { x, y} ⊂ {2, 5, 8}\nor {x, y} ⊂ {3, 6, 9} ⇒ (x, y) ∈ R2. Hence, R1 ⊂ R2. Similarly , {x, y} ∈ R2 ⇒ {x, y}\nReprint 2025-26\n\nMATHEMA TICS 14\n⊂ {1, 4, 7} or { x, y} ⊂ {2, 5, 8} or  { x, y} ⊂ {3, 6, 9} ⇒ x – y is divisible by\n3 ⇒ {x, y} ∈ R1. This shows that R2 ⊂ R1. Hence, R1 = R2.\nExample 21  Let f : X → Y be a function. Define a relation R in X given by\nR = {( a, b): f(a) = f(b)}. Examine whether R is an equivalence relation or not.\nSolution  For every a ∈ X, (a, a) ∈ R, since f(a) = f(a), showing that R is reflexive.\nSimilarly , (a, b) ∈ R ⇒ f(a) = f(b) ⇒ f(b) = f(a) ⇒ (b, a) ∈ R. Therefore, R is\nsymmetric. Further , (a, b) ∈ R and ( b, c) ∈ R ⇒ f(a) = f(b) and f(b) = f(c) ⇒ f(a)\n= f(c) ⇒ (a, c) ∈ R, which implies that R is transitive. Hence, R is an equivalence\nrelation.\nExample 22  Find the number of all one-one functions from set A = {1, 2, 3} to itself.\nSolution\n One-one function from {1, 2, 3} to itself is simply a permutation on three\nsymbols 1, 2, 3. Therefore, total number of one-one maps from {1, 2, 3} to itself is\nsame as total number of permutations on three symbols 1, 2, 3 which is 3! = 6.\nExample 23 Let A = {1, 2, 3}. Then show that  the number of relations containing (1, 2)\nand (2, 3) which are reflexive and transitive but not symmetric is three.\nSolution The smallest relation R1 containing (1, 2) and (2, 3) which is reflexive and\ntransitive but not symmetric is {(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (1, 2), (2, 3), (1, 3)}. Now , if we add\nthe pair (2, 1) to R1 to get R2, then the relation R2 will be reflexive, transitive but not\nsymmetric. Similarly , we can obtain R3 by adding (3, 2) to R1 to get the desired relation.\nHowever , we can not add two pairs (2, 1), (3, 2) or single pair (3, 1) to R1 at a time, as\nby doing so, we will be forced to add the remaining pair in order to maintain transitivity\nand in the process, the relation will become symmetric also which is not required. Thus,\nthe total number of desired relations is three .\nExample 24  Show that the number of equivalence relation in the set {1, 2, 3} containing\n(1, 2) and (2, 1) is two.\nSolution The smallest equivalence relation R1 containing (1, 2) and (2, 1) is {(1, 1),\n(2, 2), (3, 3), (1, 2), (2, 1)}. Now we are left with only 4 pairs namely (2, 3), (3, 2),\n(1, 3) and (3, 1). If we add any one, say (2, 3) to R1, then for symmetry we must add\n(3, 2) also and now for transitivity we are forced to add (1, 3) and (3, 1). Thus, the only\nequivalence relation bigger than R1 is the universal relation. This shows that the total\nnumber of equivalence relations containing (1, 2) and (2, 1) is two.\nExample 25 Consider the identity function IN : N → N defined as IN (x) = x ∀x ∈ N.\nShow that although IN is onto but IN + IN : N → N defined as\n(IN + IN) (x) = IN (x) + IN (x) = x + x = 2x  is not onto.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nRELA TIONS AND FUNCTIONS 15\nSolution Clearly IN is onto. But IN + IN is not onto, as we can find an element 3\nin the co-domain N such that there does not exist any x in the domain N with\n(IN + IN) (x) = 2 x = 3.\nExample 26  Consider a function f : 0,2π →  Rgiven by f(x) = sin x and\ng : 0,2π →  Rgiven by g(x) = cos x .

But ( f + g) (0) = sin 0 + cos 0 = 1 and\n(f + g)\n2π    = sin cos 12 2π π+ = . Therefore, f + g is not one-one.\nMiscellaneous Exercise on Chapter 1\n1.Show that the function f : R → {x ∈ R : – 1 < x  < 1} defined by ( )1 | |xf xx=+,\nx ∈ R is one one and onto function.\n2.Show that the function f : R → R given by f(x) = x3 is injective.\n3.Given a non empty set X, consider P(X) which is the set of all subsets of X.\nDefine the relation R in P(X) as follows:\nFor subsets A, B in P(X), ARB if and only if A ⊂ B.

Descartes (1596-1650), who used the word ‘function’ in his manuscript\n“Geometrie ” in 1637 to mean some positive integral power xn of a variable x\nwhile studying geometrical curves like hyperbola, parabola and ellipse. James\nGregory (1636-1675) in his work “ Vera Cir culi et Hyperbolae Quadratura ”\n(1667) considered function as a quantity obtained from other quantities by\nsuccessive use of algebraic operations or by any other operations. Later G . W\n.\nLeibnitz (1646-1716) in his manuscript “ Methodus tangentium inversa, seu  de\nfunctionibus ” written in 1673 used the word ‘function’ to mean a quantity varying\nfrom point to point on a curve such as the coordinates of a point on the curve, the\nslope of the curve, the tangent and the normal to the curve at a point. However ,\nin his manuscript “ Historia ” (1714), Leibnitz used the word ‘function’ to mean\nquantities that depend on a variable. He was the first to use the phrase ‘function\nof x’. John Bernoulli (1667-1748) used the notation φ x for the first time in 1718 to\nindicate a function of x. But the general adoption of symbols like f, F, φ, ψ ... to\nrepresent functions was made by Leonhard Euler (1707-1783) in 1734 in the first\npart of his manuscript “ Analysis Infinitorium ”. Later on, Joeph Louis Lagrange\n(1736-1813) published his manuscripts “ Theorie des functions analytiques ” in\n1793, where he discussed  about analytic function and used the notion f(x), F(x),\nφ(x) etc. for dif ferent function of x. Subsequently , Lejeunne Dirichlet\n(1805-1859) gave the definition of function which was being used till the set\ntheoretic definition of function presently used, was given after set theory was\ndeveloped by Georg Cantor (1845-1918). The set theoretic definition of function\nknown to us presently is simply an abstraction of the definition given by Dirichlet\nin a rigorous manner .\nReprint 2025-26\n\n",

If we add any one, say (2, 3) to R1, then for symmetry we must add\n(3, 2) also and now for transitivity we are forced to add (1, 3) and (3, 1). Thus, the only\nequivalence relation bigger than R1 is the universal relation. This shows that the total\nnumber of equivalence relations containing (1, 2) and (2, 1) is two."
