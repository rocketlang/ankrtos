The latest models\nof digital cameras, mobile phones and\ntelevisions made by the leading\nmanufacturers of the world are within\nour reach. Every season, new models\nof automobiles can be seen on Indian\nroads. Gone are the days when\nAmbassador and Fiat were the only\ncars on  Indian roads. Today, Indians\nare buying cars produced by nearly\nall the top companies in the world. A\nsimilar explosion of brands can be\nseen for many other goods: from shirts\nto televisions to processed fruit juices.\nSuch wide-ranging choice of goods\nin our markets is a relatively recent\nphenomenon. Y ou wouldn’t have\nfound such a wide variety of goods in\nIndian markets even two decades\nback. In a matter of years, our\nmarkets have been transformed!\nHow do we understand these\nrapid transformations? What are the\nfactors that are bringing about these\nchanges? And, how are these changes\naffecting the lives of the people?\nWe shall dwell on these questions in\nthis chapter .\nReprint 2025-26\nReprint 2025-26\n\n56 5656 5656 U UUUUNDERST NDERSTNDERST NDERSTNDERST ANDINGANDINGANDING ANDINGANDING  E  E E  E ECONOMICCONOMICCONOMICCONOMICCONOMIC  D  D D  D DEVEL EVELEVEL EVELEVEL OPMENT OPMENTOPMENT OPMENTOPMENTUntil the middle of the twentieth\ncentury, production was largely\norganised within countries.  What\ncrossed the boundaries of these\ncountries were raw material, food stuff\nand finished products. Colonies such\nas India exported raw materials and\nfood stuff and imported finished\ngoods. T rade was the main channel\nconnecting distant countries. This was\nbefore large companies called\nSpreading  of ProductionSpreading  of ProductionSpreading  of ProductionSpreading  of ProductionSpreading  of Production\nby an MNCby an MNCby an MNCby an MNCby an MNC\nA large MNC, producing industrial equipment, designs its\nproducts in research centres in the United States, and then\nhas the components manufactured in China. These are then\nshipped to Mexico and Easter n Eur ope wher e the pr oducts\nare assembled and the finished products are sold all over the\nworld. Meanwhile, the company’s customer care is carried out\nthrough call centres located in India.\nPRODUCTION ACROSS COUNTRIES\nmultinational corporations  (MNCs)\nemerged on the scene. A MNC is a\ncompany that owns or controls\nproduction in more than one nation.\nMNCs set up offices and factories for\nproduction in regions where they can\nget cheap labour and other resources.\nThis is done so that the cost of\nproduction is low and the MNCs can\nearn greater profits. Consider the\nfollowing example.\nThis is a call centre in Bengaluru, equipped with telecom facilities and access to\nthe Internet to provide information and support to customers abroad.\nReprint 2025-26\nReprint 2025-26\n\nG GG GGL LLLLOBALISAOBALISAOBALISAOBALISAOBALISA TION TIONTION TIONTION     AND ANDAND ANDAND     THE THETHE THETHE I  I I  I INDIAN NDIANNDIAN NDIANNDIAN  E  E E  E ECONOMYCONOMYCONOMYCONOMYCONOMY 57 5757 5757Complete the following statement to show how the production process in the garment\nindustry is spread across countries.\nThe brand tag says ‘Made in Thailand’ but they are not Thai products. We dissect\nthe manufacturing process and look for the best solution at each step. We are\ndoing it globally . In making garment s, the comp any may , for example, get cotton\nfibre from Korea, ........LET’S WORK THIS OUTIn this example the MNC is not only\nselling its finished products globally,\nbut more important, the goods and\nservices are produced globally. As\na result, production is organised in\nincreasingly complex ways .  The\nproduction process is divided into\nsmall parts and spread out across the\nglobe. In the above example, China\nprovides the advantage of being a\ncheap manufacturing location.\nMexico and Eastern Europe are usefulfor their closeness to the markets\nin the US and Europe. India has\nhighly skilled engineers who can\nunderstand the technical aspects of\nproduction. It also has educated\nEnglish speaking youth who can\nprovide customer care services. And\nall this probably can mean 50-60 per\ncent cost-savings for the MNC!\nThe advantage of spreading out\nproduction across the borders to the\nmultinationals can be truly immense.\nINTERLINKING PRODUCTION ACROSS\nCOUNTRIES\nAt times, MNCs set up production\njointly with some of the local\ncompanies of these countries. The\nbenefit to the local company of such\njoint production is two-fold. First,\nMNCs can provide money for\nadditional investments, like buying\nnew machines for faster production.\nSecond, MNCs might bring with them\nthe latest technology for production.In general, MNCs set up production\nwhere it is close to the markets; where\nthere is skilled and unskilled labour\navailable at low costs; and where the\navailability of other factors of\nproduction is assured. In addition,\nMNCs might look for government\npolicies that look after their interests.\nYou will r ead mor e about the policies\nlater in the chapter .\nHaving assured themselves of these\nconditions, MNCs set up factories and\noffices for production. The money that\nis spent to buy assets such as land,\nbuilding, machines and other\nequipment is called investment.\nInvestment made by MNCs is called\nforeign investment . Any investment\nis made with the hope that these\nassets will earn profits.\nWE WILL SHIFT\nTHIS F ACTORY TO\nANOTHER COUNTR Y .\nIT HAS BECOME\nEXPENSIVE HERE!\nReprint 2025-26\nReprint 2025-26\n\n58 5858 5858 U UUUUNDERST NDERSTNDERST NDERSTNDERST ANDINGANDINGANDING ANDINGANDING  E  E E  E ECONOMICCONOMICCONOMICCONOMICCONOMIC  D  D D  D DEVEL EVELEVEL EVELEVEL OPMENT OPMENTOPMENT OPMENTOPMENTBut the most common route for\nMNC investments is to buy up local\ncompanies and then to expand\nproduction. MNCs with huge wealth\ncan quite easily do so. To take an\nexample, Cargill Foods, a very large\nAmerican MNC, has bought over\nsmaller Indian companies such as\nParakh Foods. Parakh Foods had\nbuilt a large marketing network in\nvarious parts of India, where its brand\nwas well-reputed. Also, Parakh Foods\nhad four oil refineries, whose control\nhas now shifted to Cargill. Cargill is\nnow the largest producer of edible oil\nin India, with a capacity to make 5\nmillion pouches daily!\nIn fact, many of the top MNCs\nhave wealth exceeding the entire\nbudgets of the developing country\ngovernments. With such enormous\nwealth, imagine the power and\ninfluence of these MNCs!\nThere’s another way in which\nMNCs control production. Large\nMNCs in developed countries place\norders for production with small\nproducers. Gar ments, footwear ,\nsports items are examples of\nindustries where production is\ncarried out by a large number of\nsmall producers around the world.\nThe products are supplied to the\nMNCs, which then sell these under\ntheir own brand names to the\ncustomers. These large MNCs have\ntremendous power to determine price,\nquality, delivery, and labour\nconditions for these distant\nproducers.\nThus, we see that there are a\nvariety of ways in which the MNCs are\nspreading their production and\ninteracting with local producers in\nvarious countries across the globe. By\nsetting up partnerships with local\ncompanies, by using the local\ncompanies for supplies, by closely\ncompeting with the local companies\nor buying them up, MNCs are exerting\na strong influence on production\nat these distant locations. As a\nresult , production in these widely\ndispersed locations is getting\ninterlinked.Women at home in Ludhiana making footballs for lar ge MNCs\nJeans produced in developing countries being\nsold in USA for Rs 6500 ($145)\nReprint 2025-26\nReprint 2025-26\n\nG GG GGL LL LLOBALISAOBALISAOBALISAOBALISAOBALISA TIONTIONTION TIONTION     AND ANDAND ANDAND     THE THETHE THETHE I  I I  I INDIAN NDIANNDIAN NDIANNDIAN  E  E E  E ECONOMYCONOMYCONOMYCONOMYCONOMY 59 5959 5959Read the passage on the left and answer the questions.LET’S WORK THESE OUT\n1.Would you say Ford Motors is a MNC? Why?\n2.What is foreign investment? How much did Ford Motors invest in India?\n3.By setting up their production plants in India, MNCs such as Ford\nMotors tap the advantage not only of the large markets that countries\nsuch as India provide, but also the lower costs of production. Explain\nthe statement.\n4.Why do you think the company wants to develop India as a base for\nmanufacturing car components for its global operations? Discuss the\nfollowing factors:\n(a)cost of labour and other resources in India\n(b)the presence of several local manufacturers who supply auto-\nparts to Ford Motors\n(c) closeness to a large number of buyers in India and China\n5.In what ways will the production of cars by Ford Motors in India lead to\ninterlinking of production?\n6.In what ways is a MNC different from other companies?\n7.Nearly all major multinationals are American, Jap anese or European,\nsuch as Nike, Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Honda, Nokia. Can you guess why?\nFor a long time foreign trade has be en\nthe main channel connecting\ncountries. In history you would have\nread about the trade routes\nconnecting I ndia and South A sia to\nmarkets both in the East and W est\nand the extensive trade that took\nplace along these routes. A lso, you\nwould remember that it was trading\ninterests which attracted various\ntrading companies such as the East\nIndia Company to India. What then\nis the basic function of foreign trade?To put it simply , foreign trade\ncreates an opportunity for the\nproducers to reach beyond the\ndomestic markets, i.e., markets of their\nown countries. Producers can sell their\nproduce not only in markets located\nwithin the country but can also compete\nin markets located in other countries\nof the world. Similarly , for the buyers,\nimport of goods produced in another\ncountry is one way of expanding the\nchoice of goods beyond what is\ndomestically produced.FOREIGN TRADE AND\nINTEGR ATION OF MARKETSFord Motors, an American\ncompany, is one of the\nworld’s largest automobile\nmanufacturers  with\nproduction spread over 26\ncountries of the world.\nFord Motors came to India\nin 1995 and spent Rs.\n1700 crore to set up a\nlarge plant near Chennai.\nThis was done in\ncollaboration with\nMahindra and Mahindra,\na major Indian\nmanufacturer of jeeps and\ntrucks. By the year 2017,\nFord Motors was selling\n88,000 cars in the Indian\nmarkets,\nwhile another 1,81,000\ncars were exported from\nIndia to South Africa,\nMexico, Brazil and United\nStates of America. In recent\nyears, Ford Company\nstopped producing cars for\nselling in India but expor t\ncars and car engines on a\nsmall scale  to other\ncountries .\nCars made by Indian workers being\ntransported to be sold abroad by MNCs.\nReprint 2025-26\nReprint 2025-26\n\nChinese Toys in IndiaChinese Toys in IndiaChinese Toys in IndiaChinese Toys in IndiaChinese Toys in India\nChinese manufactur ers lear n\nof an  opportunity to export toys\nto India, where toys are sold at\na high price.

W ithin a year ,\n70 to 80 per cent of the toy\nshops have replaced Indian\ntoys with Chinese toys. Toys\nare now cheaper in the Indian\nmarkets than earlier .\nLet us see the effect of foreign trade\nthrough the example of Chinese toys\nin the Indian markets.\nWhat is happening here? As a\nresult of trade, Chinese toys\ncome into the Indian markets.\nIn the competition between\nIndian and Chinese toys,\nChinese toys pr ove better .\nIndian buyers have a greater\nchoice of toys and at lower\nprices. For the Chinese toy\nmakers, this provides an\nopportunity to expand business.\nThe opposite is true for Indian\ntoy makers.

Explain.LET’S WORK THESE OUTIn general, with the opening of\ntrade, goods travel from one market\nto another . Choice of goods in the\nmarkets rises. Prices of similar goods\nin the two markets tend to become\nequal. And, producers in the two\ncountries now closely compete against\neach other even though they are\nseparated by thousands of miles!\nForeign trade thus results in\nconnecting the markets or\nintegration of markets in  different\ncountries.\nIn the past two to three decades, more\nand more MNCs have been looking for\nlocations around the world which\nwould be cheap for their production.\nForeign investment by MNCs in these\ncountries has been rising.  At the same\ntime, foreign trade between countries\nhas been rising rapidly. A large part\nof the foreign trade is also controlled\nby MNCs. For instance, the car\nmanufacturing plant of Ford Motors\nin India not only produces cars for the\nIndian markets, it also exports cars\nto other developing countries and\nexports car components for its many\nfactories around the world. Likewise,\nactivities of most MNCs involve\nsubstantial trade in goods and also\nservices.WHA T IS GL OBALISA TION?\nBE CAREFUL!

For instance, the past fifty years have\nseen several improvements in transportation technology. This has made much\nfaster delivery of goods across long distances possible at lower costs.The result of greater foreign\ninvestment and greater foreign trade\nhas been greater integration of\nproduction and markets across\ncountries. Globalisation is this\nprocess of rapid integration or\ninterconnection between countries.\nMNCs are playing a major role in\nthe globalisation process.

This is\nthrough the movement of people\nbetween countries. People usually\nmove from one country to another in\nsearch of better income, better jobs or\nbetter education. In the past few\ndecades, however , ther e has not been\nmuch increase in the movement of\npeople between countries due to\nvarious restrictions.\nContainers for\ntransport of goods\nGoods are placed in containers\nthat can be loaded intact onto\nships, railways, planes and trucks.\nContainers have led to huge\nreduction in port handling costs\nand increased the speed with\nwhich exports can reach markets.\nSimilarly, the cost of air transport\nhas fallen.

Suppose the\nIndian government puts a tax on\nimport of toys. What would happen?\nThose who wish to import these toys\nwould have to pay tax on this. Because\nof the tax, buyers will have to pay a\nhigher price on imported toys. Chinese\ntoys will no longer be as cheap  in the\nIndian markets and imports from\nChina will automatically reduce.\nIndian toy-makers will pr osper .\nTax on imports is an example of\ntrade barrier . It is called a barrier\nbecause some restriction has been set\nup. Governments can use trade\nbarriers to increase or decrease\n(regulate) foreign trade and to decide\nwhat kinds of goods and how much\nof each, should come into the country.\nThe Indian government, after\nIndependence, had put barriers to\nforeign trade and foreign investment.\nThis was considered necessary to\nprotect the producers within the\ncountry  from foreign competition.\nIndustries were just coming up in the\n1950s and 1960s, and competition\nfrom imports at that stage would not\nhave allowed these industries to come\nup. Thus, India allowed imports\nof only essential items such asmachinery, fertilisers, petroleum\netc. Note that all developed\ncountries, during the early stages of\ndevelopment, have given protection to\ndomestic producers through a variety\nof means.\nStarting ar ound 1991, some far -\nreaching changes in policy were made\nin India.  The government decided that\nthe time had come for Indian\nproducers to compete with producers\naround the globe. It felt that\ncompetition would improve the\nperformance of producers within the\ncountry since they would have to\nimprove their quality. This decision\nwas supported by powerful\ninternational organisations.\nThus, barriers on foreign trade and\nforeign investment were removed to a\nlarge extent. This meant that goods\ncould be imported and exported\neasily and also foreign companies\ncould set up factories and offices\nhere.\nRemoving barriers or restrictions\nset by the government is what is\nknown as liberalisation.  With\nliberalisation of trade, businesses are\nallowed to make decisions freely\nabout what they wish to import or\nexport. The government imposes\nmuch less restrictions than before\nand is therefore said to be more\nliberal.\n1.What do you understand by liberalisation of foreign trade?\n2.Tax on import s is one type of trade barrier . The government could also place a limit on\nthe number of goods that can be imported. This is known as quotas.  Can you explain,\nusing the example of Chinese toys, how quotas can be used as trade barriers?\nDo you think this should be used?

On\nthe other hand, WTO rules have forced\nthe developing countries to remove\ntrade barriers. An example of this is\nthe current debate on trade in\nagricultural products.We have seen that the liberalisation\nof foreign trade and investment in\nIndia was supported by some very\npowerful international organisations.\nThese organisations say that all\nbarriers to foreign trade and\ninvestment are harmful. There\nshould be no barriers.

And yet this very\nsmall percentage of people\nwho are engaged in\nagriculture in the US  receive\nmassive sums of money from\nthe US gover nment for\nproduction and for exports to\nother countries.

What has been its effect on\nthe lives of people? Let us look at\nsome of the evidence.\nGlobalisation and greater\ncompetition among producers - both\nlocal and foreign producers - has been\nof advantage to consumers,\nparticularly the well-off sections in the\nurban areas. There is greater choice\nbefore these consumers who now\nenjoy improved quality and lower\nprices for several products. As a result,\nthese people today, enjoy much\nhigher standards of living than was\npossible earlier .Among producers and workers,\nthe impact of globalisation has not\nbeen uniform.\nFirstly, MNCs have increased their\ninvestments in India over the past 20\nyears, which means investing in India\nhas been beneficial for them. MNCs\nhave been interested in industries\nsuch as cell phones, automobiles,\nelectronics, soft drinks, fast food or\nservices such as banking in urban\nareas. These products have a large\nnumber of well-off  buyers. In these\nindustries and services, new jobs have\nbeen created. Also, local companies\nsupplying raw materials, etc. to these\nindustries have prospered.1.Fill in the blanks.\nWTO was started at the initiative of __________countries.

Besides, a host of\nservices such as data entry, account-\ning, administrative tasks, engineering\nare now being done cheaply in\ncountries such as India and are\nexported to the dev eloped countries.Secondly, several of the top Indian\ncompanies  have been able to benefit\nfrom the increased competition.

Industrial zones, called\nSpecial Economic Zones (SEZs), are\nbeing set up. SEZs are to have world class\nfacilities: electricity, water , roads,\ntransport, storage, recreational and\neducational facilities. Companies who set\nup production units in the SEZs do not\nhave to pay taxes for an initial period of\nfive years.\nGovernment has also allowed\nflexibility  in the labour laws to attract\nforeign investment. Y ou have seen in\nChapter 2 that the companies in the\norganised sector have to obey certain\nrules that aim to protect the workers’rights. In the recent years, the government\nhas allowed companies to ignore many of\nthese. Instead of hiring workers on a\nregular basis, companies hire workers\n‘flexibly’ for short periods when there is\nintense pressure of work. This is done to\nreduce the cost of labour for the company.\nHowever , still not satisfied, for eign\ncompanies are demanding more flexibility\nin labour laws.Steps to Attract Foreign InvestmentSteps to Attract Foreign InvestmentSteps to Attract Foreign InvestmentSteps to Attract Foreign InvestmentSteps to Attract Foreign Investment\nNOW, WE\nARE READY\nTO INVEST!\nReprint 2025-26\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSmall producers: Compete or perish\nFor a large number of small producers and\nworkers globalisation has posed major\nchallenges.\nBatteries, capacitors, plastics, toys, tyres, dairy products, and\nvegetable oil are some examples of industries where the small\nmanufacturers have been hit hard due to competition. Several of\nthe units have shut down rendering many workers jobless. The\nsmall and medium industries in India employ the largest number\nof workers ( 11 crores ) in the country, next only to agriculture.\n1.What are the ways in which Ravi’s small production unit was affected by rising competition?\n2.Should producers such as Ravi stop production because their cost of production is higher compared to\nproducers in other countries? What do you think?\n3.Recent studies point out that small producers in India need three things to compete better in the market\n(a) better roads, power , water , raw materials, marketing and information network (b) improvement s and\nmodernisation of technology (c) timely availability of credit at reasonable interest rates.\nlCan you explain how these three things would help Indian producers?\nlDo you think MNCs will be interested in investing in these?

Even when some\nof them bought capacitors, they would\nprefer to import as the price of the\nimported item was half the price\ncharged by people like Ravi.\nRavi now produces less than half the\ncapacitors that he produced in the year\n2000 and has only seven workers\nworking for him.

Faced with growing competition, most employers these days prefer to\nemploy workers ‘flexibly’. This means that workers’ jobs are no longer secure.\nA Garment WorkerA Garment WorkerA Garment WorkerA Garment WorkerA Garment Worker\n35 year old Sushila has spent many\nyears as a worker in garment export\nindustry of Delhi. She was employed\nas a ‘per manent worker’ entitled to\nhealth insurance, provident fund,\novertime at a double rate, when\nSushila’s factory closed in the late\n1990s.  After searching for a job  for\nsix months, she finally got a job  30\nkm. away from where she lives. Even\nafter working in this factory for\nseveral years, she is a temporary\nworker and ear ns less than half of\nwhat she was earning earlier .\nSushila leaves her house every\nmorning, seven days a week at 7:30\na.m. and r eturns at 10 p.m.  A day\noff from work means no wage. She\nhas none of the benefits she used\nto get earlier . Factories closer to her\nhome have widely fluctuating orders\nand therefore pay even less.Let us see how the workers in the garment export industry\nin India are having to bear this pressure of competition.\nLarge MNCs in the garment industry in\nEurope and America order their products\nfrom Indian exporters. These large MNCs\nwith worldwide network look for the cheapest\ngoods in order to maximise their profits. To\nget these large orders, Indian garment\nexporters try hard to cut their own costs. As\ncost of raw materials cannot be reduced,\nexporters try to cut labour costs. Where\nearlier a factory used to employ workers on\na permanent basis, now they employ workers\nonly on a temporary basis so that they do\nnot have to pay workers for the whole year .\nWorkers also have to put in very long\nworking hours and work night shifts on a\nregular basis during the peak season. W ages\nare low and workers are forced to work\novertime to make both ends meet.\nWhile this competition among the garment\nexporters has allowed the MNCs to make large\nprofits, workers are denied their fair share of\nbenefits brought about by globalisation.Factory workers folding garments for export. Though globalisation has created opportunities for paid work for\nwomen, the condition of employment shows that women are denied their fair share of benefits.\nG GG GGL LLLLOBALISAOBALISAOBALISAOBALISAOBALISA TION TIONTION TIONTION     AND ANDAND ANDAND     THE THETHE THETHE I  I I  I INDIAN NDIANNDIAN NDIANNDIAN  E  E E  E ECONOMYCONOMYCONOMYCONOMYCONOMY 69 6969 6969\nReprint 2025-26\nReprint 2025-26\n\n70 7070 7070 U UUUUNDERST NDERSTNDERST NDERSTNDERST ANDINGANDINGANDING ANDINGANDING  E  E E  E ECONOMICCONOMICCONOMICCONOMICCONOMIC  D  D D  D DEVEL EVELEVEL EVELEVEL OPMENT OPMENTOPMENT OPMENTOPMENTThe conditions of work and the hardships of the workers described above\nhave become common to many industrial units and services in India.

It can support small\nproducers to improve their\nperformance till the time they become\nstrong enough to compete. If\nnecessary, the government can use\ntrade and investment barriers. It can\nnegotiate at the WTO for ‘fairer rules’.\nIt can also align with other developing\ncountries with similar interests to\nfight against the domination of\ndeveloped countries in the WTO.\nIn the past few years, massive\ncampaigns and  representation by\npeople’s organisations have\ninfluenced important decisions\nrelating to trade and investments at\nthe WTO. This has demonstrated\nthat people also can play an\nimportant role in the struggle for fair\nglobalisa tion.The above evidence indicates that\nnot everyone has benefited from\nglobalisation. People with education,\nskill and wealth have made the best\nuse of the new opportunities.

MNCs are playing a\nmajor role in the globalisation\nprocess. More and more MNCs\nare looking for locations around\nthe world that are cheap for their\nproduction. As a result,\nproduction is being organised\nin complex ways.\nTechnology, particularly IT,\nhas played a big role in\norganising production across\ncountries.  In addition,\nliberalisation of trade andSUMMING UP\ninvestment has facilitated\nglobalisation by removing\nbarriers to trade and\ninvestment.  At the inter -\nnational level, WTO has put\npressure on developing coun-\ntries to liberalise trade and\ninvestment.\nWhile globalisation has\nbenefited well-off consumers\nand also producers with skill,\neducation and wealth, many\nsmall producers and workers\nhave suffered as a result of the\nrising competition.
