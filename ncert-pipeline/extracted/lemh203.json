      "content": "Chapter 9\nDIFFERENTIAL   EQUA TIONS\nHenri Poincare\n(1854-1912 )\nReprint 2025-26\n\nDIFFERENTIAL  EQUA TIONS 301\nLet us consider the equation:\ndyx ydx+ =0 ... (4)\nWe see that equations (1), (2) and (3) involve independent and/or dependent variable\n(variables) only but equation (4) involves variables as well as derivative of the dependent\nvariable y with respect to the independent variable x. Such an equation is called a\ndiffer ential equation .\nIn general, an equation involving  derivative (derivatives) of the dependent variable\nwith respect to independent variable (variables) is called a differential equation.\nA differential equation involving derivatives of the dependent variable with respect\nto only one independent variable is called an ordinary differential equation, e.g.,\n3 2\n22d y dy\ndx dx +   =0  is an ordinary differential equation .... (5)\nOf course, there are differential equations involving derivatives with respect to\nmore than one independent variables, called partial differential equations but at this\nstage we shall confine ourselves to the study of ordinary dif ferential equations only .\nNow onward, we will use the term ‘differential equation’ for ‘ordinary differential\nequation’.\n/handptrtsld1Note\n1.We shall prefer to use the following notations for derivatives:\n2 3\n2 3, ,dy d y d yy y ydx dx dx′ ′ ′ ′′′= = =\n2.For derivatives of higher order , it will be inconvenient  to use so many dashes\nas supersuffix therefore, we use the notation yn for nth order derivative n\nnd y\ndx.\n9.2.1.  Order of a differential equation\nOrder of a differential equation is defined as the order of the highest order derivative of\nthe dependent variable with respect to the independent variable involved in the given\ndifferential equation.\nConsider the following differential equations:\ndy\ndx =ex... (6)\nReprint 2025-26\n\nMATHEMA TICS 302\n2\n2d yy\ndx+ =0 ... (7)\n33 2\n2\n3 2d y d yx\ndx dx   +      =0 ... (8)\nThe equations (6), (7) and (8) involve the highest derivative of first, second and\nthird order respectively . Therefore, the order of these equations are 1, 2 and 3 respectively .\n9.2.2   Degree of a differential equation\nTo study the degree of a dif ferential equation, the key point is that the dif ferential\nequation must be a polynomial equation in derivatives, i.e., y′, y″, y″′ etc. Consider the\nfollowing differ ential equations:\n23 2\n3 22d y d y dyydx dx dx + − + \n  =0 ... (9)\n2\n2sindy dyydx dx   + −       =0 ... (10)\nsindy dy\ndx dx +   =0 ... (11)\nWe observe that equation (9) is a polynomial equation in y″′,  y″ and y′, equation (10)\nis a polynomial equation in y′ (not a polynomial in y though). Degree of such differential\nequations can be defined. But equation (1 1) is not a polynomial equation in y′ and\ndegree of such a differential equation can not be defined.\nBy the degree of a differential equation, when it is a polynomial equation in\nderivatives, we mean the highest power (positive integral index) of the highest order\nderivative involved in the given differential equation.\nIn view of the above definition, one may observe that differential equations (6), (7),\n(8) and (9) each are of degree one, equation (10) is of degree two while the degree of\ndifferential equation (1 1) is not defined.\n/handptrtsld1Note    Order and degree (if defined) of a differential equation are always\npositive integers.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nDIFFERENTIAL  EQUA TIONS 303\nExample 1 Find the order and degree, if defined, of each of the following differential\nequations:\n(i) cos 0dyxdx− = (ii)  2 2\n20d y dy dyxy x ydx dx dx + − =  \n(iii)20yy y e′′ ′′+ + =\nSolution\n(i)The highest order derivative present in the differential equation is dy\ndx, so its\norder is one. It is a polynomial equation in y′ and the highest power raised to dy\ndx\nis one, so its degree is one.\n(ii) The highest order derivative present in the given differential equation is 2\n2d y\ndx, so\nits order is two. It is a polynomial equation in 2\n2d y\ndx and dy\ndx and the highest\npower raised to 2\n2d y\ndx is one, so its degree is one.\n(iii) The highest order derivative present in the differential equation is y′′′, so its\norder is three. The given differential equation is not a polynomial equation in its\nderivatives and so its degree is not defined.\nEXERCISE 9.1\nDetermine order and degree (if defined) of differential equations given in Exercises\n1 to 10.\n1.4\n4sin( ) 0d yy\ndx′′′ + = 2. y′ + 5y = 0 3.4 2\n23 0ds d ssdt dt + =  \n4.22\n2cos 0d y dy\ndx dx   + =      5.2\n2cos3 sin3d yx x\ndx= +\n6.2( )y′ ′′ + (y″)3 + (y′)4 + y5 = 0 7.y′′′ + 2y″ + y′ = 0\nReprint 2025-26\n\nMATHEMA TICS 304\n8.y′ + y = ex9.y″ + (y′)2 + 2y = 0 10. y″ + 2y′ + sin y = 0\n11.The degree of the differential equation\n3 2 2\n2sin 1 0d y dy dy\ndx dx dx    + + + =          is\n(A) 3 (B) 2 (C) 1 (D) not defined\n12.

General and Particular Solutions of a Differential Equation\nIn earlier Classes, we have solved the equations of the type:\nx2 + 1 = 0 ... (1)\nsin2 x – cos x  =0 ... (2)\nSolution of equations (1) and (2) are numbers, real or complex, that will satisfy the\ngiven equation i.e., when that number is substituted for the unknown x in the given\nequation, L.H.S. becomes equal to the R.H.S..\nNow consider the differential equation 2\n20d yy\ndx+ = ... (3)\nIn contrast to the first two equations, the solution of this differential equation is a\nfunction φ that will satisfy it i.e., when the function φ is substituted for the unknown y\n(dependent variable) in the given differential equation, L.H.S. becomes equal to R.H.S..\nThe curve y = φ (x) is called the solution curve (integral curve) of the given\ndifferential equation. Consider the function given by\ny = φ (x) =a sin ( x + b), ... (4)\nwhere a, b ∈ R. When this function and its derivative are substituted in equation (3),\nL.H.S. = R.H.S.. So it is a solution of the differential equation (3).\nLet a and b be given some particular values say a = 2 and 4bπ=, then we get a\nfunction y = φ1(x) = 2sin4xπ +  ... (5)\nWhen this function and its derivative are substituted in equation (3) again\nL.H.S. = R.H.S.. Therefore φ1 is also a solution of equation (3).\nReprint 2025-26\n\nDIFFERENTIAL  EQUA TIONS 305\nFunction φ consists of two arbitrary constants (parameters) a, b and it is called\ngeneral solution  of the given differential equation. Whereas function φ1 contains no\narbitrary constants but only the particular values of the parameters a and b and hence\nis called a particular solution  of the given differential equation.\nThe solution which contains  arbitrary constants is called the general solution\n(primitive ) of the differential equation.\nThe solution free from arbitrary constants i.e., the solution obtained from the general\nsolution by giving particular values to the arbitrary constants is called a particular\nsolution  of the differential equation.\nExample 2  Verify that the function y = e–3x is a solution of the dif ferential equation\n2\n26 0d y dyydx dx+ − =\nSolution  Given function is  y = e–3x.

Methods of Solving First O rder, First Degr ee Dif ferential Equations\nIn this section we shall discuss three methods of solving first order first degree differential\nequations.\n9.4.1  Differential equations with variables separable\nA first order-first degree differential equation is of the form\ndy\ndx =F(x, y) ...

The differential equation (1) then has the form\ndy\ndx =h (y) . g(x) ... (2)\nIf h(y) ≠ 0, separating the variables, (2) can be rewritten as\n1\n( )h y dy =g(x) dx ...

This led him to discover the ‘ method of separation of variables ’\n1691. A year later he formulated the ‘ method of solving the homogeneous\nReprint 2025-26\n\nDIFFERENTIAL  EQUA TIONS 337\n—/xrhombus /xrhombus/xrhombus /xrhombus/xrhombus—differ ential equations of the first or der’. He went further in a very short time\nto the discovery of the ‘ method of solving a linear differ ential equation of the\nfirst-or der’. How surprising is it that all these methods came from a single man\nand that too within 25 years of the birth of differential equations!\nIn the old days, what we now call the ‘solution’ of a differential equation, was\nused to be referred to as ‘integral’ of the differential equation, the word being\ncoined by James Bernoulli (1654 - 1705) in 1690. The word ‘solution was first\nused by Joseph Louis Lagrange (1736 - 1813) in 1774, which was almost hundred\nyears since the birth of differential equations. It was Jules Henri Poincare\n(1854 - 1912) who strongly advocated the use of the word ‘solution’ and thus the\nword ‘solution’  has found its deserved place in modern terminology . The name of\nthe ‘method of separation of variables ’ is due to John Bernoulli (1667 - 1748),\na younger brother of James Bernoulli.\nApplication to geometric problems were also considered. It was again John\nBernoulli who first brought into light the intricate nature of differential equations.\nIn a letter to Leibnitz, dated May 20, 1715, he revealed the solutions of the\ndifferential equation\nx2 y″ = 2y,\nwhich led to three types of curves, viz., parabolas, hyperbolas and a class of\ncubic curves. This shows how varied the solutions of such innocent looking\ndifferential equation can be. From the second half of the twentieth century attention\nhas been drawn to the investigation of this complicated nature of the solutions of\ndifferential equations, under the heading ‘ qualitative analysis of differ ential\nequations’. Now-a-days, this has acquired prime importance being absolutely\nnecessary in almost all investigations.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n",
