Do\nyou agree with her? Who do you think has done better?\nMansi told them that they cannot decide who has done better by just comparing the\ntotal marks obtained because the maximum marks out of which they got the marks are not\nthe same.\nShe said why don’t you see the Percentages given in your report cards?\nAnita’ s Percentage was 80 and Rita’ s was 83.3. So, this shows Rita has done better .\nDo you agree?\nPercentages are numerators of fractions with denominator 100  and have been\nused in comparing results. Let us try to understand in detail about it.\n7.1.1  Meaning of Percentage\nPer cent is derived from Latin word ‘per centum’ meaning ‘per hundred’.\nPer cent is represented by the symbol % and means hundredths too. That is 1% means\n1 out of hundred or one hundredth. It can be written as:  1% = 1\n100 = 0.01\nTo understand this, let us consider the following example.\n2024-25\n\nCOMP ARING QU ANTITIES 109\nRina made a table top of 100 dif ferent coloured tiles. She counted yellow , green, red\nand blue tiles separately and filled the table below . Can you help her complete the table?\n Colour Number Rate per Fraction Written as Read as\nof Tiles Hundred\n Yellow 14\n1414\n10014% 14 per cent\n Green 26 2626\n10026% 26 per cent\n Red 35 35   ---- ----\n----\n Blue 25 --------   ---- ---- ----\nTotal 100\n1.Find the Percentage of children of different heights for the following data.\nHeight Number of Children In Fraction In Percentage\n110 cm 22\n120 cm 25\n128 cm 32\n130 cm 21\nTotal 100\n2.A shop has t he following number of shoe pairs of different\nsizes.\nSize 2 : 20 Size 3 : 30 Size 4 : 28\nSize 5 : 14 Size 6 : 8\nWrite this information in tabular form as done earlier and\nfind the Perce ntage of each shoe size available in the shop.\nPercentages when total is not hundred\nIn all these examples, the total number of items add up to 100. For example, Rina had 100\ntiles in all, there were 100 children and 100 shoe pairs. How do we calculate Percentage\nof an item if the total number of items do not add up to 100? In such cases, we need to\nconvert the fraction to an equivalent fraction with denominator 100. Consider the following\nexample. You have a necklace with twenty beads in two colours.TRY THESE\n2024-25\n\nMATHEMA TICS 110\nColour Number Fraction Denominator  Hundred In Percentage\nof Beads\nRed 88\n208\n20100\n10040\n100× = 40%\nBlue 1212\n2012\n20100\n10060\n100× = 60%\nTotal   20\nWe see that these three methods can be used to find the Percentage when the total\ndoes not add to give 100. In the method shown in the table, we multiply the fraction by\n100\n100. This does not change the value of the fraction. Subsequently , only 100 remains in the\ndenominator .\nAnwar has used the unitary method. Asha has multiplied by 5\n5 to get 100 in the\ndenominator . You can use whichever method you find suitable. May be, you can make\nyour own method too.\nThe method used by Anwar can work for all ratios. Can the method used by Asha also\nwork for all ratios? Anwar says Asha’ s method can be used only if you can find a natural\nnumber which on multiplication with the denominator gives 100. Since denominator was 20,\nshe could multiply it by 5 to get 100. If the denominator was 6, she would not have been\nable to use this method. Do you agree?\n1.A collection of 10 chips with different colours is given .\nColour Number Fraction Denominator Hundred In Percentage\nGreen\nBlue\nRed\nTotal\nFill the table and find the percentage of chips of each colour .Asha does it like this\n8\n208 5\n20 5=×\n×\n= =40\n100 =  40%Anwar found the Percentage of red beads like this\nOut of 20 beads, the number of red beads is 8.\nHence, out of 100, the number of red beads is\n8100 4020× =  (out of hundred) = 40%\nTRY THESE\nG G GG\nRRRBBB\n2024-25\n\nCOMP ARING QU ANTITIES 111\n 2.Mala has a collection of bangles. She has 20 gold bangles and 10 silver bangles.\nWhat is the percentage of bangles of each type? Can you put it in the tabular form\nas done in the above example?\nTHINK, DISCUSS  AND WRITE\n1.Look at the examples below and in each of them, discuss which is better for\ncomparison.\nIn the atmosphere, 1 g of air contains:\n.78 g Nitrogen 78% Nitrogen\n.21 g Oxygen or 21% Oxygen\n.01 g Other gas 1% Other gas\n2.A shirt has:\n3\n5 Cotton 60% Cotton\n2\n5 Polyster 40% Polyster\n7.1.2  Converting Fractional Numbers to Percentage\nFraction al numbers can have dif ferent denominator . To compare fractional numbers, we\nneed a common denominator and we have seen that it is more convenient to compare if\nour denominator is 100. That is, we are converting the fractions to Percentages. Let us try\nconverting different fractional num bers to Percentages.\nEXAMPLE 1Write 1\n3 as per cent.\nSOLUTION We have,  1 1 100 1100%3 3 100 3= × = ×\n= 100 1% 33 %3 3=\nEXAMPL E2Out of 25 children in a class, 15 are girls. What is the percentage of girls?\nSOLUTION Out of 25 children, there are 15 girls.\nTherefore, percentage of girls = 15\n25×100 = 60. There are 60% girls in the class.\nEXAMPL E3Convert 5\n4 to per cent.\nSOLUTION We have, 5\n45\n4100 125 = × = % %\nor\n2024-25\n\nMATHEMA TICS 112\nFrom these examples, we find that the percentages related to proper fractions are less\nthan 100 whereas percentages related to improper fractions are more than 100.\nTHINK, DISCUSS  AND WRITE\n(i)Can you eat 50% of a cake? Can you eat 100% of a cake?\nCan you eat 150% of a cake?\n(ii)Can a price of an item go up by 50%? Can a price of an item go up by 100%?\nCan a price of an item go up by 150%?\n7.1.3  Converting Decimals to Percentage\nWe have seen how fractions can be converted to per cents. Let us now find how decimals\ncan be converted to per cents.\nEXAMPLE  4  Convert the given decimals to per cents:\n(a)0.75 (b)0.09 (c)0.2\nSOLUTION\n(a)0.75 = 0.75 × 100 % (b)0.09 = 9\n100 = 9 %\n= 75\n100 × 100 % = 75%\n(c)0.2 = 2\n10 × 100% = 20 %\n 1.Convert the following to per cents:\n(a)12\n16(b) 3.5 (c)49\n50(d)2\n2(e)0.05\n 2.(i) Out of 32 students, 8 are absent. What per cent of the students are absent?\n(ii) There are 25 radios, 16 of them are out of order . What per cent of radios are\nout of order?\n(iii) A shop has 500 items, out of which 5 are defective. What per cent are defective?\n(iv) There are 120 voters, 90 of them voted yes. What per cent voted yes?\n7.1.4  Converting Percentages to Fractions or Decimals\nWe have so far converted fractions and decimals to percentages. We can also do the\nreverse. That is, given per cents, we can convert them to decimals or fractions. Look at the\ntable, observe and complete it:\nTRY THESE\n2024-25\n\nCOMP ARING QU ANTITIES 113\nPer cent 1% 10% 25% 50% 90% 125% 250%\nFraction1\n10010\n1001\n10=\nDecimal 0.01 0.10\nParts always add to give a whole\nIn the examples for coloured tiles, for the heights of children and for gases\nin the air , we find that when we add the Percentages we get 100. All the\nparts that form the whole when added together gives the whole or 100%.\nSo, if we are given one part, we can always find out the other part. Suppose,\n30% of a given number of students are boys.\nThis means that if there were 100 students, 30 out of them would be boys and the\nremaining  would be girls.\nThen girls would obviously be (100 – 30)% = 70%.\n1.35% + _______% = 100%, 64% + 20% +________ %  = 100%\n45% = 100%  – _________ %, 70% = ______% – 30%\n2.If 65% of students in a class have a bicycle, what per cent\nof  the student do  not have bicycles?\n3.We have a basket full of apples, oranges and mangoes.\nIf 50% are apples, 30% are oranges, then what per cent\nare mangoes?\nTHINK, DISCUSS  AND WRITE\nConsider the expenditure made on a dress\n20% on embroidery , 50% on cloth, 30% on stitching.\nCan you think of more such examples?=\nTRY THESE\nMake some\nmore such\nexamples\nand solve\nthem.\n2024-25\n\nMATHEMA TICS 114\n7.1.5  Fun with Estimation\nPercentages help us to estimate the parts of an area.\nEXAMPLE  5What per cent of the adjoining figure is shaded?\nSOLUTION We first find the fraction of the figure that is shaded. From this fraction,\nthe percentage of the shaded part can be found.\nYou will find that half of the figure is shaded. And,1 1×100 % 50 %2 2= =\nThus, 50 % of the figure is shaded.\n What per cent of these figures are shaded?\n(i) (ii)\nTangram\nYou can make some more figures yourself and ask your friends to estimate the\nshaded parts.\n7.2  U SE OF PERCENTAGES\n7.2.1  Interpreting Percentages\nWe saw how percentages were helpful in comparison. We have also learnt to convert\nfractional numbers and decimals to percentages. Now , we shall learn how percentages\ncan be used in real life. For this, we start with interpreting the following statements:\n—5% of the income is saved by Ravi. — 2 0% of Meera’ s dresses are blue in colour .\n—Rekha gets 1 0% on every book sold by her .\nWhat can you infer from each of these statements?\nBy 5% we mean 5 parts out of 100 or we write it as 5\n100. It means Ravi is saving\n` 5 out of every ` 100 that he earns. In the same way , interpret the rest of the statements\ngiven above.\n7.2.2  Converting Percentages to “How Many”\nConsider the following examples:\nEXAMPLE  6A survey of 40 children showed that 25% liked playing football. How\nmany children liked playing football?\nSOLUTION Here, the total number of children are 40. Out of these, 25% like playing\nfootball. Meena and Arun used the following methods to find the number .\nYou can choose either method.TRY THESE\n1\n1 6\n1\n1 61\n4\n1\n81\n4\n1\n8\n1\n8\n2024-25\n\nCOMP ARING QU ANTITIES 115\nTRY THESE\nArun does it like this\nOut of 100, 25 like playing football\nSo out of 40, number of children who like\nplaying football = 25× 40100 = 10Hence, 10 children out of 40 like\nplaying football.Meena does it like this\n25% of 40 =25× 40100\n= 10\n1.Find:\n(a)50% of 164 (b)75\n% of 12 (c)1122% of 64\n2.8% children of a class of 25 like getting wet in the rain. How many children like\ngetting wet in the rain.\nEXAMPLE  7Rahul bought a sweater and saved ` 200 when a discount of 25% was\ngiven. What was the price of the sweater before the discount?\nSOLUTION Rahul has saved ` 200 when price of sweater is reduced by 25%. This\nmeans that 25% reduction in price is the amount saved by Rahul. Let us\nsee how Mohan and Abdul have found the original cost of the sweater .\nMohan’ s solution Abdul’ s solution\n25% of the original price = ` 200 ` 25 is saved for every ` 100\nLet the price (in `) be P Amount for which ` 200 is saved\nSo, 25% of P = 200 or 25200100P× = = 10020025×  =  ` 800\nor, 2004P=  or P  = 200 × 4\nTherefore, P = 800\n1.9 is 25% of what number? 2.75% of what number is 15?\nEXERCISE  7.1\n1.Convert the given fractional numbers to per cents.\n(a)1\n8(b)5\n4(c)3\n40(d)2\n7Thus both obtained the original price of\nsweater as ` 800.\nTRY THESE\n2024-25\n\nMATHEMA TICS 116\n2.Convert the given decimal fractions to per cents.\n(a)0.65 (b)2.1 (c)0.02 (d)12.35\n3.Estimate what part of the figures is coloured and hence find the per cent which is\ncoloured.\n4.Find:\n(a)15% of 250 (b)1% of 1 hour (c)20% of ` 2500 (d)75% of 1 kg\n5.Find the whole quantity if\n(a)5% of it is 600.

It won 25% of them. How\nmany matches did they win?\n7.2.3  Ratios to Percents\nSometimes, parts are given to us in the form of ratios and we need to convert those to\npercentages. Consider the following example:\nEXAMPLE  8Reena’ s mother said, to make idlis, you must take two parts rice and\none part urad dal . What percentage of such a mixture would be rice\nand what percentage would be urad dal ?\nSOLUTION In terms of ratio we would write this as Rice : Urad dal  = 2 : 1.\nNow, 2 + 1=3 is the total of all parts. This means rd2\n3 part is rice and rd1\n3 part is urad dal .\nThen, percentage of rice would be 2\n3100200\n3662\n3× = = % % .\nPercentage of urad dal  would be 1 100 1100 % 33 %3 3 3× = = .(i) (ii) (iii)\n2024-25\n\nCOMP ARING QU ANTITIES 117\nEXAMPLE  9If ` 250 is to be divided amongst Ravi, Raju and Roy , so that Ravi gets\ntwo parts, Raju three parts and Roy five parts. How much money will\neach get? What will it be in percentages?\nSOLUTION The parts which the three boys are getting can be written in terms of\nratios as 2 : 3 : 5. Total of the parts is 2 + 3 + 5 = 10.\nAmounts received by each Percentages of money for each\n2\n10× ` 250 = ` 50 Ravi gets 2×100 % 20 %10=\n325010×` = ` 75 Raju gets 3×100 % 30 %10=\n525010×` = ` 125 Roy gets 5×100 % 50 %10=\n   1.Divide 15 sweets between Manu and Sonu so that they get 20 %\nand 80 % of them respectively .\n   2.If angles of a triangle are in the ratio 2 : 3 : 4. Find the value of\neach angle.\n7.2.4  Increase or Decrease as Per Cent\nThere are times when we need to know the increase or decrease in a certain quantity as\npercentage. For example, if the population of a state increased from 5,50,000 to\n6,05,000. Then the increase in population can be understood better if we say , the\npopulation increased by 10 %.\nHow do we convert the increase or decrease in a quantity as a percentage of the initial\namount? Consider the following example.\nEXAMPLE  10A school team won 6 games this year against 4 games won last year .\nWhat is the per cent increase?\nSOLUTION The increase in the number of wins (or amount of change) = 6 – 4 = 2.\nPercentage increase =amount of change\noriginal amount or base× 100\n=increase in the number of wins×100original number of wins = 2\n4× 100 = 50\nEXAMPLE  11The number of illiterate persons in a country decreased from 150 lakhs\nto 100 lakhs in 10 years. What is the percentage of decrease?\nSOLUTION Original amount = the number of illiterate persons initially = 150 lakhs.TRY THESE\n2024-25\n\nMATHEMA TICS 118\nAmount of change = decrease in the number of illiterate persons = 150 – 100 = 50 lakhs\nTherefore, the percentage of decrease\n                = amount of change\noriginal amount× 100 = 50\n150100 331\n3× =\n1.Find Percentage of increase or decrease:\n–Price of shirt decreased from ` 280 to ` 210.\n–Marks in a test increased from 20 to 30.\n2.My mother says, in her childhood petrol was ` 1 a litre. It is ` 52 per litre today . By\nwhat Percentage has the price gone up?\n7.3  PRICES RELATED  TO AN ITEM OR BUYING AND SELLING\nI bought it for ` 600\n    and will sell it for ` 610\nThe buying price of any it em is known as its cost price . It is written in short as CP .\nThe price at which you sell is known as the selling price  or in short SP .\nWhat would you say is better , to you sell the item at a lower price, same price or higher\nprice than your buying price? You can decide whether the sale was profitable or not\ndepending on the CP  and SP . If CP  < SP   then you made a profit = SP  – CP .\nIf CP = SP  then you are in a no profit no loss situation.\nIf CP  > SP   then you have a loss = CP  – SP .\nLet us try to interpret the statements related to prices of items.\n/circle6  A toy bought for ` 72 is sold at \n` 80.\n/circle6  A T-shirt bought for ` 120 is sold at ` 100.\n/circle6  A cycle bought for ` 800 is sold for ` 940.\nLet us consider the first statement.\nThe buying price (or CP) is ` 72 and the selling price (or SP) is ` 80. This means SP\nis more than CP . Hence profit made  = SP  – CP   = ` 80 – ` 72 = ` 8\nNow try interpreting the remaining statements in a similar way .\n7.3.1  Profit or Loss as a Percentage\nThe profit or loss can be converted to a percentage. It is always calculated on the CP .\nFor the above examples, we can find the profit % or loss %.\nLet us consider the example related to the toy . We have CP  = ` 72, SP  = ` 80,\nProfit = ` 8. To find the percentage of profit, Neha and Shekhar have used the\nfollowing methods.TRY THESE\n2024-25\n\nCOMP ARING QU ANTITIES 119\nThus, the profit is ` 8 and\nprofit Per cent is 1119.\nThus, by both methods we get the SP as\n` 108.On ` 120, the loss is ` 20\nSo on ` 100, the lossNeha does it this way Shekhar does it this way\nProfit per cent =Profit\nCP× 100 = 8\n72×100 On ` 72 the profit is ` 8\n                               = 1\n9100×  = 111\n9On ` 100,  profit = 8\n72×100\n = 111\n",

Sohini said her father was going to\ntake a loan from a bank. The money you borrow is known as sum borrowed\nor principal .\nThis money would be used by the borrower for some time before it is\nreturned. For keeping this money for some time the borrower has to pay some\nextra money to the bank. This is known as Interest.\nYou can find the amount you have to pay at the end of the year by adding\nthe sum borrowed and the interest. That is, Amount = Principal + Inter est.\nInterest is generally given in per cent for a period of one year . It is written\nas  say 10% per year or per annum or in short as 10% p.a. (per annum).\n10% p.a. means on every ` 100 borrowed, ` 10 is the interest you have to pay for one\nyear. Let us take an example and see how this works.\nEXAMPLE  14Anita takes a loan of ` 5,000 at 15% per year as rate of interest. Find\nthe interest she has to pay at  the end of one year .Therefore, SP = 100 + 20  = 120\nNow , when SP  is ` 120,\nthen CP is ` 100.\nTherefore, when SP is ` 540,\nthen CP = 100540120×  = ` 450\nTRY THESE\n2024-25\n\nCOMP ARING QU ANTITIES 121\nSOLUTION The sum borrowed = ` 5,000, Rate of interest = 15% per year .\nThis means if ` 100 is borrowed, she has to pay ` 15 as interest for one year . If she has\nborrowed ` 5,000, then the interest she has to pay for one year\n= ` 155000100×  = ` 750\nSo,  at the end of the year she has to give an amount of  ` 5,000 + ` 750 =  ` 5,750.\nWe can write a general relation to find interest for one year . Take P as the principal or\nsum and R % as Rate per cent per annum.\nNow on every ` 100 borrowed, the interest paid is ` R\nTherefore,  on ` P borrowed, the interest paid for one year would be 100R P× = P R×\n100.\n7.4.1  Inter est for Multiple Y ears\nIf the amount is borrowed for more than one year the interest is calculated for the period\nthe money is kept for . For example, if Anita returns the money at the end of two years and\nthe rate of interest is the same then she would have to pay twice the interest i.e., ` 750 for\nthe first year and ` 750 for the second. This way of calculating interest where principal is\nnot changed is known as simple inter est. As the number of years increase the interest\nalso increases. For ` 100 borrowed for 3 years at 18%, the interest to be paid at the end\nof 3 years is 18 + 18 + 18 = 3 × 18 = ` 54.\nWe can find the general form for simple interest for more than one year .\nWe know that on a principal of `\n P at R% rate of interest per year , the interest paid for\none year is R P×\n100. Therefore, interest I paid for T years would be\nT R P P R T PRT× ×=× ×\n100 100 100or\nAnd amount you have to pay at the end of T years is A = P + I\n 1.` 10,000 is invested at 5% interest rate p.a.
