These\nmusical instruments are commonly\nused in many parts of our country. These\ninstruments are simply beaten or struck\n(Fig. 10.6).

Put your hand on\nyour throat as shown in Fig. 10.8. Do\nyou feel any vibrations?\nIn humans, the sound is produced\nby the voice box  or the larynx . Put your\nfingers on the throat and find a hard\nbump that seems to move when you\nswallow. This part of the body is known\nas the voice box. It is at the upper end\nof the windpipe. Two vocal cords,\n are\nstretched across the voice box or larynx\nin such a way that it leaves a narrow\nslit between them for the passage of air\n(Fig.10.8).\nFig. 10.7 :  Jaltrang\nWhen we pluck the string of an\ninstrument, like the sitar , the sound\nthat we hear is not only that of the\nstring. The whole instrument is forced\nto vibrate, and it is the sound of the\nvibration of the instrument that we\nhear. Similarly, when we strike the\nmembrane of a mridangam , the sound\nthat we hear is not only that of the\nmembrane but of the whole body of\nthe instrument.When we speak, does\nany part of our body\nvibrate?\nFig.10.8 : Voice box in humans\nWhen the lungs force air through the\nslit, the vocal cords vibrate, producing\nsound. Muscles attached to the vocal\ncords can make the cords tight or loose.\nWhen the vocal cords are tight and thin,\nthe type or quality of voice is differentActivity 10.5\nTake 6-8 bowls or tumblers. Fill\nthem with water up to  different\nlevels, increasing gradually from\none end to the other . Now take\na  pencil and strike the bowls gently.\nStrike all of them in succession. Y ou\nwill hear pleasant sounds. This is\nyour jaltrang (Fig.10.7).\n2024-25\n\nSOUND 127from that when they are loose and\nthick. Let us see how the vocal cords\nfunction.\nActivity 10.6\nTake two rubber strips of the same\nsize. Place these two pieces one\nabove the other and stretch them\ntight. Now blow air through the gap\nbetween them [Fig. 10.9(a)]. As the\nair blows through the stretched\nrubber strips, a sound is produced.\nYou can also take a piece of paper\nwith a narrow slit and hold it\nbetween your fingers as shown in\nFig. 10.9 (b). Now blow through the\nslit and listen to the sound. Our\nvocal cords produce sound in a\nsimilar manner .\n(a)\n(b)\nFig. 10.9 (a), (b) : Working of vocal cor ds\nThe vocal cords in men are about\n20 mm long. In women these are about\n15mm long. Children have very short\nvocal cords. This is the reason why\nthe voices of men, women and\nchildren are different.\n10.3 Sound Needs a Medium\nfor Propagation\nWhen you call up your friend who is\nstanding at a distance, your friend is\nable to hear your voice. How does the\nsound propagate or  travel to her?\nActivity 10.7\nTake a metal  or glass tumbler . Make\nsure that it is dry. Place a cell phone\nin it. (Remember that the cell phone\nmust not be kept in water .) Ask your\nfriend to give a ring on this cell\nphone from another cell phone.\nListen to the ring carefully.\nNow, surround the rim of the\ntumbler with your hands\n(Fig. 10.10). Put your mouth on the\nFig. 10.10 : Sound needs a medium to travel\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 128Place your ear gently on the water\nsurface (Fig. 10.11). (Be car eful : the\nwater should not enter in your ear .)\nCan you hear the sound of the bell?\nDoes it indicate that sound can\ntravel through liquids?\nopening between your hands.\nIndicate to your friend to give a ring\nagain. Listen to the ring while\nsucking air fr om the tumbler .\nDoes the sound become fainter\nas you suck air?\nRemove the tumbler from your\nmouth. Does the sound become\nloud again?\nCan you think of an explanation? Is\nit possible that the decreasing amount\nof air in the tumbler had something to\ndo with decreasing loudness  of the ring?\nIndeed, if you had been able to suck\nall the air in the tumbler , you will not\nlisten any sound . Actually, sound needs\na medium to travel. When air has been\nremoved completely from a vessel, it is said\nthat there is  a vacuum in the vessel. The\nsound  cannot travel through a  vacuum.\nDoes sound travel in liquids? Let us\nfind out.\nActivity 10.8\nTake a bucket or a bathtub. Fill it\nwith clean water . Take a small bell\nin one hand. Shake this bell inside\nthe water to produce sound. Make\nsure that the bell does not touch\nthe body of the bucket or the tub.Oh ! That is how whales\nand dolphins might be\ncommunicating under\nwater .\nFig. 10.11  : Sound travelling through waterFig. 10.12 : Sound travelling through a\nmetre scale\nCan you hear the sound of the\nscratching? Ask your friends\naround you if they were able to hear\nthe same sound?Let us find out if sound can travel\nthrough solids also.\nActivity 10.9\nTake a metre scale or a long metal\nrod and hold its one end to your\near. Ask your friend to gently\nscratch or tap at the other end of\nthe scale (Fig. 10.12).\n2024-25\n\nSOUND 129You can also per form the above\nactivity by placing your ear at one end\nof a long wooden or metallic table and\nasking your friend to gently scratch the\nother end of the table (Fig. 10.13).\nFig. 10.13 :  Sound can travel through solids\nWe find that sound can travel\nthrough wood or metal. In fact, sound\ncan travel thr ough any solid. Y ou can\nperform inter esting activities to show\nthat sound can also travel through\nstrings. Have you ever made a toy\ntelephone (Fig. 10.14). Can you say that\nsound can travel through strings?\nFig. 10.14 : A toy telephone\nWe have lear nt so far that vibrating\nobjects produce sound and it is carried\nin all directions in a medium. The\nmedium could be a gas, a liquid or a\nsolid. How do we hear it?\nFig. 10.15 : Understanding action of an eardrum10.4 We Hear Sound thr ough\nOur Ears\nThe shape of the outer part of the ear is\nlike a funnel. When sound enters it, it\ntravels down a canal at the end of which\nthere is a thin stretched membrane. It\nis called the eardrum. It per forms an\nimportant function. To understand what\nthe eardrum does, let us build a tin-can\nmodel of the eardrum.\nActivity 10.10\nTake a plastic or tin-can. Cut its\nends. Stretch a piece of rubber\nballoon across one end of the can\nand fasten it with a rubber band.\nPut four or five grains of dry cereal\non the str etched rubber . Now ask\nyour friend to speak “Hurrey,\nHurrey” from the open end\n(Fig.10.15). Observe what  happens\nto the grain. Why do the grains\njump up and down?\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 130The eardrum is like a stretched\nrubber sheet. Sound vibrations make\nthe eardrum vibrate (Fig. 10.16). The\neardrum sends vibrations to the inner\near. From ther e, the signal goes to the\nbrain. That is how we hear .You have alr eady lear nt in earlier classes\nabout the oscillatory motion and its\ntime period.\nThe number of oscillations  per\nsecond is called the frequency  of\noscillation. Frequency is expressed in\nhertz . Its symbol is Hz. A frequency of\n1 Hz is one oscillation per second. If an\nobject oscillates 20 times in one second,\nwhat would be its frequency?\nYou can r ecognise many familiar\nsounds without seeing the objects\nproducing them. How is it possible?\nThese sounds must be different to\nenable you to recognise them. Have you\never thought what factors make them\ndifferent?  Amplitude  and frequency are\ntwo important properties of any sound.\nCan we differentiate sounds on the basis\nof their amplitudes and frequencies?\nLoudness and Pitch\nActivity 10.11\nTake a metallic tumbler and a\ntablespoon. Strike the tablespoon\ngently at the brim of the tumbler .Fig. 10.16 : Human ear\nFig. 10.17 : Thermocol ball touching the\nvibrating glass tumblerWe must NEVER put a sharp,\npointed or hard thing into our\near. It can damage the\neardrum. The damaged\neardrum can impair hearing.\n10.5 Amplitude, T ime Period\nand Frequency of a\nVibration\nWe have lear nt that the to and fr o motion\nof an object is known as vibration. This\nmotion is also called oscillatory motion .Eardrum\nInner ear\n2024-25\n\nSOUND 131Hear the sound produced. Now bang\nthe spoon on the tumbler and hear\nthe sound produced again. Is the\nsound louder when the tumbler is\nstruck hard?\nNow suspend a small thermocol\nball touching the rim of the tumbler\n(Fig. 10.17). Vibrate the tumbler by\nstriking it. See how far the ball is\ndisplaced. The displacement of the\nball is a measure of the amplitude\nof vibration of the tumbler .\nNow, strike the tumbler gently\nand then a little har der. Compar e\nthe amplitudes of vibrations of the\ntumbler in the two cases. In which\ncase is the amplitude larger?\nLoudness of sound is proportional to\nthe square of the amplitude of the\nvibration producing the sound. For\nexample, if the amplitude becomes\ntwice, the loudness increases by a\nfactor of 4. The loudness is expressed\nin a unit called decibel (dB). The\nfollowing table gives some idea of the\nloudness of sound coming from\nvarious sources.\nNormal breathing 10 dB\nSoft whisper (at 5m) 30 dB\nNormal conversation 60 dB\nBusy traffic 70 dB\nAverage factory 80 dB\nAbove 80 dB the noise becomes\nphysically painful.I wonder why my voice\nis different from that of\nmy teacher .\nCompare the sound of a baby with\nthat of an adult. Is there any difference?\nEven if two sounds are equally loud,\nthey differ in some way. Let us see how.\nFig. 10.18 : Frequency determines the\npitch of a soundThe loudness of sound depends on\nits amplitude. When the amplitude of\nvibration is large, the sound produced\nis loud. When the amplitude is small,\nthe sound produced is feeble.The frequency determines the\nshrillness or pitch  of a sound. If the\nfrequency of vibration is higher we say\nthat the sound is shrill and has a higher\npitch. If the frequency of vibration is\nlower , we say that the sound has a lower\npitch. For example, a drum vibrates with\na low frequency. Therefore, it produces\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 132a low-pitched sound. On the other\nhand, a whistle has a high frequency\nand therefore, produces a sound of\nhigher pitch (Fig. 10.18). A bird makes\na high-pitched sound whereas a lion\nmakes a low-pitched r oar. However , the\nroar of a lion is very loud while the\nsound of the bird is quite feeble.\nEvery day you hear the voices of\nchildren and adults. Do you find any\ndifference in their voices? Can you say\nthat the frequency of the voice of a child\nis higher than that of an adult?\nUsually the voice of a woman has\na higher  frequency than that of a\nman.\n10.6 Audible and Inaudible\nSounds\nWe know that we need a vibrating body\nfor the production of sound. Can we\nhear the sound of all vibrating bodies?\nThe fact is that sounds of frequencies\nless than about 20 vibrations per second\n(20 Hz) cannot be detected by the  human\near. Such sounds ar e called inau dible.\nOn the higher side, sounds of  frequencies\nhigher\n than about 20,000 vibrations per\nsecond (20 kHz) are also not audible to\nthe  human ear . Thus, for human ear,\nthe range of audible frequencies is\nroughly from 20 to 20,000 Hz.\nSome animals can hear sounds of\nfrequencies higher than 20,000 Hz.\nDogs have this ability. The police use\nhigh frequency whistles which dogs can\nhear but humans cannot.\nThe ultrasound equipment, familiar\nto us for investigating and tracking\nmany medical problems, works at\nfrequencies higher than 20,000 Hz.10.7 Noise and Music\nWe hear dif ferent types of sounds\naround us. Is the sound always\npleasing? Does a sound sometimes\ncause discomfort to you? Some sounds\nare pleasant to the ear , wher eas some\nare not.\nSuppose construction work is going\non in your neighbourhood. Are the\nsounds coming from the construction\nsite pleasing ? Do you enjoy the sounds\nproduced by horns of buses and trucks?\nSuch unpleasant sounds are called\nnoise . In a classroom, if all the students\nspeak together , what would the sound\nproduced be called?\nOn the other hand you enjoy sounds\nfrom musical instruments.  Musical\nsound is one which is pleasing to the\near. Sound pr\noduced by a harmonium\nis a musical sound. The string of a sitar\nalso gives out a musical sound.  But, if\na musical sound becomes too loud,\nwould it remain melodious ?\n10.8 Noise Pollution\nYou alr eady know about air pollution.\nPresence of unwanted gases and\nparticles in air is called air pollution.\nSimilarly, presence of excessive or\nunwanted sounds in the environment\nis called noise pollution. Can you list\nsome sources of noise pollution? Major\ncauses of noise pollution are sounds of\nvehicles, explosions including bursting\nof crackers, machines, loudspeakers etc.\nWhat sources in the home may lead to\nnoise? Television and transistor radio\nat high volumes, some kitchen\nappliances, desert coolers, air\nconditioners, all contribute to noise\npollution.\n2024-25\n\nSOUND 133Hearing Impairment\nTotal hearing impairment, which is rare, is usually from birth itself. Partial\ndisability is generally the result of a disease, injury or age. Children with\nimpaired hearing need special care. By learning sign language, such children\ncan communicate effectively. Because speech develops as the direct result of\nhearing, a child with a hearing loss may have defective speech also.\nTechnological devices for the hearing-impaired have made it possible for such\npersons to improve their quality of life. Society can do much to  improve the\nliving environment for the hearing-impaired and help them live normal lives.What are the Harms of Noise\nPollution?\nDo you know that presence of excessive\nnoise in the surroundings may cause\nmany health related problems. Lack of\nsleep, hypertension (high blood-\npressure), anxiety and many more health\ndisorders may be caused by noise\npollution. A person who is exposed to a\nloud sound continuously may get\ntemporary or even permanent\nimpairment of hearing.\nMeasures to Limit Noise Pollution\nTo control noise, we  must control the\nsources of noise. How can this be\nachieved? For this, silencing devicesmust be installed in air  craft engines,\ntransport vehicles, industrial\nmachines and home appliances.\nHow can the noise pollution be\ncontrolled in a residential area?\nAll noisy operations must be\nconducted away from any residential\narea. Noise producing industries\nshould be set up away from such\nareas. Use of automobile horns\nshould be minimi s\ned. TV and music\nsystems should be run at low\nvolumes. Trees must be planted along\nthe roads and around buildings to\ncut down on the sounds reaching the\nresidents, thus reducing the harmful\neffects of noise pollution.\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 134\n KEYWORDS KEYWORDS KEYWORDS KEYWORDS KEYWORDS\nAMPLITUDE\nEARDRUM\nFREQUENCY\nhertz  (Hz)\nLARYNX\nLOUDNESS\nNOISE\nOSCILLA TION\nPITCH\nTIME PERIOD\nVIBRA TION\nVOICE BOX\nWIND PIPE WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT\nÜSound is produced by vibrating objects.\nÜIn human beings, the vibration of the vocal\ncords produces sound.\nÜSound travels through a medium (gas, liquid\nor solid).

The damaged\neardrum can impair hearing.\n10.5 Amplitude, T ime Period\nand Frequency of a\nVibration\nWe have lear nt that the to and fr o motion\nof an object is known as vibration. This\nmotion is also called oscillatory motion .Eardrum\nInner ear\n2024-25\n\nSOUND 131Hear the sound produced. Now bang\nthe spoon on the tumbler and hear\nthe sound produced again. Is the\nsound louder when the tumbler is\nstruck hard?\nNow suspend a small thermocol\nball touching the rim of the tumbler\n(Fig. 10.17). Vibrate the tumbler by\nstriking it. See how far the ball is\ndisplaced. The displacement of the\nball is a measure of the amplitude\nof vibration of the tumbler .\nNow, strike the tumbler gently\nand then a little har der. Compar e\nthe amplitudes of vibrations of the\ntumbler in the two cases. In which\ncase is the amplitude larger?\nLoudness of sound is proportional to\nthe square of the amplitude of the\nvibration producing the sound. For\nexample, if the amplitude becomes\ntwice, the loudness increases by a\nfactor of 4. The loudness is expressed\nin a unit called decibel (dB). The\nfollowing table gives some idea of the\nloudness of sound coming from\nvarious sources.\nNormal breathing 10 dB\nSoft whisper (at 5m) 30 dB\nNormal conversation 60 dB\nBusy traffic 70 dB\nAverage factory 80 dB\nAbove 80 dB the noise becomes\nphysically painful.I wonder why my voice\nis different from that of\nmy teacher .\nCompare the sound of a baby with\nthat of an adult. Is there any difference?\nEven if two sounds are equally loud,\nthey differ in some way. Let us see how.\nFig. 10.18 : Frequency determines the\npitch of a soundThe loudness of sound depends on\nits amplitude. When the amplitude of\nvibration is large, the sound produced\nis loud. When the amplitude is small,\nthe sound produced is feeble.The frequency determines the\nshrillness or pitch  of a sound. If the\nfrequency of vibration is higher we say\nthat the sound is shrill and has a higher\npitch. If the frequency of vibration is\nlower , we say that the sound has a lower\npitch. For example, a drum vibrates with\na low frequency. Therefore, it produces\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 132a low-pitched sound. On the other\nhand, a whistle has a high frequency\nand therefore, produces a sound of\nhigher pitch (Fig. 10.18). A bird makes\na high-pitched sound whereas a lion\nmakes a low-pitched r oar. However , the\nroar of a lion is very loud while the\nsound of the bird is quite feeble.\nEvery day you hear the voices of\nchildren and adults. Do you find any\ndifference in their voices? Can you say\nthat the frequency of the voice of a child\nis higher than that of an adult?\nUsually the voice of a woman has\na higher  frequency than that of a\nman.\n10.6 Audible and Inaudible\nSounds\nWe know that we need a vibrating body\nfor the production of sound. Can we\nhear the sound of all vibrating bodies?\nThe fact is that sounds of frequencies\nless than about 20 vibrations per second\n(20 Hz) cannot be detected by the  human\near. Such sounds ar e called inau dible.\nOn the higher side, sounds of  frequencies\nhigher\n than about 20,000 vibrations per\nsecond (20 kHz) are also not audible to\nthe  human ear . Thus, for human ear,\nthe range of audible frequencies is\nroughly from 20 to 20,000 Hz.\nSome animals can hear sounds of\nfrequencies higher than 20,000 Hz.\nDogs have this ability. The police use\nhigh frequency whistles which dogs can\nhear but humans cannot.\nThe ultrasound equipment, familiar\nto us for investigating and tracking\nmany medical problems, works at\nfrequencies higher than 20,000 Hz.10.7 Noise and Music\nWe hear dif ferent types of sounds\naround us. Is the sound always\npleasing? Does a sound sometimes\ncause discomfort to you? Some sounds\nare pleasant to the ear , wher eas some\nare not.\nSuppose construction work is going\non in your neighbourhood. Are the\nsounds coming from the construction\nsite pleasing ? Do you enjoy the sounds\nproduced by horns of buses and trucks?\nSuch unpleasant sounds are called\nnoise . In a classroom, if all the students\nspeak together , what would the sound\nproduced be called?\nOn the other hand you enjoy sounds\nfrom musical instruments.  Musical\nsound is one which is pleasing to the\near. Sound pr\noduced by a harmonium\nis a musical sound. The string of a sitar\nalso gives out a musical sound.  But, if\na musical sound becomes too loud,\nwould it remain melodious ?\n10.8 Noise Pollution\nYou alr eady know about air pollution.\nPresence of unwanted gases and\nparticles in air is called air pollution.\nSimilarly, presence of excessive or\nunwanted sounds in the environment\nis called noise pollution. Can you list\nsome sources of noise pollution? Major\ncauses of noise pollution are sounds of\nvehicles, explosions including bursting\nof crackers, machines, loudspeakers etc.\nWhat sources in the home may lead to\nnoise? Television and transistor radio\nat high volumes, some kitchen\nappliances, desert coolers, air\nconditioners, all contribute to noise\npollution.\n2024-25\n\nSOUND 133Hearing Impairment\nTotal hearing impairment, which is rare, is usually from birth itself. Partial\ndisability is generally the result of a disease, injury or age. Children with\nimpaired hearing need special care. By learning sign language, such children\ncan communicate effectively. Because speech develops as the direct result of\nhearing, a child with a hearing loss may have defective speech also.\nTechnological devices for the hearing-impaired have made it possible for such\npersons to improve their quality of life. Society can do much to  improve the\nliving environment for the hearing-impaired and help them live normal lives.What are the Harms of Noise\nPollution?\nDo you know that presence of excessive\nnoise in the surroundings may cause\nmany health related problems. Lack of\nsleep, hypertension (high blood-\npressure), anxiety and many more health\ndisorders may be caused by noise\npollution. A person who is exposed to a\nloud sound continuously may get\ntemporary or even permanent\nimpairment of hearing.\nMeasures to Limit Noise Pollution\nTo control noise, we  must control the\nsources of noise. How can this be\nachieved? For this, silencing devicesmust be installed in air  craft engines,\ntransport vehicles, industrial\nmachines and home appliances.\nHow can the noise pollution be\ncontrolled in a residential area?\nAll noisy operations must be\nconducted away from any residential\narea. Noise producing industries\nshould be set up away from such\nareas. Use of automobile horns\nshould be minimi s\ned. TV and music\nsystems should be run at low\nvolumes. Trees must be planted along\nthe roads and around buildings to\ncut down on the sounds reaching the\nresidents, thus reducing the harmful\neffects of noise pollution.\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 134\n KEYWORDS KEYWORDS KEYWORDS KEYWORDS KEYWORDS\nAMPLITUDE\nEARDRUM\nFREQUENCY\nhertz  (Hz)\nLARYNX\nLOUDNESS\nNOISE\nOSCILLA TION\nPITCH\nTIME PERIOD\nVIBRA TION\nVOICE BOX\nWIND PIPE WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT\nÜSound is produced by vibrating objects.\nÜIn human beings, the vibration of the vocal\ncords produces sound.\nÜSound travels through a medium (gas, liquid\nor solid).
