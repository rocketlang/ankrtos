It will suffice to\nsay here that one extracts the compounds, then\nsubjects the extract to various separation\ntechniques till one has separated a compound\nfrom all other compounds. In other words, one\nisolates and purifies a compound. Analytical\ntechniques, when applied to the compound give\nus an idea of the molecular formula and the\nprobable structure of the compound. All the\ncarbon compounds that we get from living\ntissues can be called ‘biomolecules’. H owever ,\nliving organisms have also got inorganic\nelements and compounds in them. How do we\nknow this? A slightly different but destructive\nexperiment has to be done. One weighs a small\namount of a living tissue (say a leaf or liver and\nthis is called wet weight) and dry it. A ll the water ,\nevaporates. The remaining material gives dry\nweight. Now if the tissue is fully burnt, all the\ncarbon compounds are oxidised to gaseous\nform (CO2, water vapour) and are removed. What\nis remaining is called ‘ash’. This ash contains\ninorganic elements (like calcium, magnesium\netc). Inorganic compounds like sulphate,\nphosphate, etc., are also seen in the acid-soluble\nfraction. Therefore elemental analysis gives\nelemental composition of living tissues in the\nform of hydrogen, oxygen, chlorine, carbon etc.\nwhile analysis for compounds gives an idea ofElement % Weight of\n  Earth’s crust  Human body\nHydrogen (H) 0.14 9.5\nCarbon  (C) 0.03 18.5\nOxygen (O) 46.6 65.0\nNitrogen (N) very little 3.3\nSulphur (S) 0.03 0.3\nSodium (Na) 2.8 0.2\nCalcium (Ca) 3.6 1.5\nMagnesium (Mg) 2.1 0.1\nSilicon (Si) 27.7 negligible\n* Adapted from CNR Rao, Understanding Chemistry ,\nUniversities Press, Hyderabad.TABLE 9.1 A Comparison of Elements Present\nin Non-living and Living Matter*\nComponent Formula\nSodium Na+\nPotassium K+\nCalcium Ca++\nMagnesium Mg++\nWater H2O\nCompounds NaCl, CaCO3,\nPO SO43\n42 − −,TABLE 9.2 A List of Representative Inorganic\nConstituents of Living Tissues\nthe kind of organic (Figure 9.1) and inorganic constituents (Table 9.2)\npresent in living tissues. From a chemistry point of view, one can identify\nfunctional groups like aldehydes, ketones, aromatic compounds, etc. But\nfrom a biological point of view, we shall classify them into amino acids,\nnucleotide bases, fatty acids etc.\nAmino acids are organic compounds containing an amino group and\nan acidic group as substituents on the same carbon i.e., the α-carbon.\nHence , they are called α-amino acids. They are substituted methanes. There\nare four substituent groups occupying the four valency positions. These\nare hydrogen, carboxyl group, amino group and a variable group\ndesignated as R group. Based on the nature of R group there are many\namino acids. H owever , those which occur in proteins are only of twenty\nReprint 2025-26\n\n106 BIOLOGY\ntypes. The R group in these proteinaceous amino acids could be a hydrogen\n(the amino acid is called glycine), a methyl group (alanine), hydroxy methyl\n(serine), etc. Three of the twenty are shown in Figure 9.1.\nThe chemical and physical properties of amino acids are essentially\nof the amino, carboxyl and the R functional groups. Based on number of\namino and carboxyl groups, there are acidic (e.g., glutamic acid), basic\n(lysine) and neutral (valine) amino acids. Similarly, there are aromatic\namino acids (tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan). A particular property\nof amino acids is the ionizable nature of –NH2 and –COOH groups. Hence\nin solutions of different pH, the structure of amino acids changes.\nB is called zwitterionic form.\nLipids are generally water insoluble. They could be simple fatty acids.\nA fatty acid has a carboxyl group attached to an R group. The R group\ncould be a methyl (–CH3), or ethyl  (–C2H5) or higher number of –CH2\ngroups (1 carbon to 19 carbons). For example, palmitic acid has 16\ncarbons including carboxyl carbon. Arachidonic acid has 20 carbon\natoms including the carboxyl carbon. Fatty acids could be saturated\n(without double bond) or unsaturated (with one or more C=C double\nbonds). Another simple lipid is glycerol which is trihydroxy propane. Many\nlipids have both glycerol and fatty acids. Here the fatty acids are found\nesterified with glycerol. They can be then monoglycerides, diglycerides\nand triglycerides. These are also called fats and oils based on melting\npoint. Oils have lower melting point (e.g., gingelly oil) and hence remain\nas oil in winters. Can you identify a fat from the market? Some lipids\nhave phosphorous and a phosphorylated organic compound in them.\nThese are phospholipids. They are found in cell membrane. Lecithin is\none example. Some tissues especially the neural tissues have lipids with\nmore complex structures.\nLiving organisms have a number of carbon compounds in which\nheterocyclic rings can be found. Some of these are nitrogen bases –\nadenine, guanine, cytosine, uracil, and thymine. When found attached to\na sugar , they ar e called nucleosides. If a phosphate group is also found\nesterified to the sugar they are called nucleotides. Adenosine, guanosine,\nthymidine, uridine and  cytidine are nucleosides. Adenylic acid, thymidylic\nacid, guanylic acid, uridylic acid and cytidylic acid are nucleotides. Nucleic\nacids like DNA and RNA consist of nucleotides only.

In animal tissues, one notices the presence of all such\ncategories of compounds shown in Figure 9.1. These are primary\nmetabolites. However , when one analyses plant, fungal and micr obial cells,\none would see thousands of compounds other than these primary\nmetabolites, e.g. alkaloids, flavonoids, rubber , essential oils, antibiotics,\ncoloured pigments, scents, gums, spices. These\nare called secondary metabolites  (Table 9.3).\nWhile primary metabolites have identifiable\nfunctions and play known roles in normal\nphysiologial processes, we do not at the moment,\nunderstand the role or functions of all the\n‘secondary metabolites’ in host organisms.\nHowever , many of them ar e useful to ‘human\nwelfar e’ (e.g., rubber , drugs, spices, scents and\npigments). Some secondary metabolites have\necological importance. In the later chapters and\nyears you will learn more about this.\n9.3BIOMACROMOLECULES\nThere is one feature common to all those compounds found in the acid\nsoluble pool. They have molecular weights ranging from 18 to around\n800 daltons (Da) approximately.\nThe acid insoluble fraction, has only four types of organic compounds\ni.e., proteins, nucleic acids, polysaccharides and lipids. These classes of\ncompounds with the exception of lipids, have molecular weights in the\nrange of ten thousand daltons and above. For this very reason,\nbiomolecules, i.e., chemical compounds found in living organisms are of\ntwo types. One, those which have molecular weights less than one\nthousand dalton and are usually referred to as micromolecules or simply\nbiomolecules while those which are found in the acid insoluble fraction\nare called macromolecules or biomacromolecules .\nThe molecules in the insoluble fraction with the exception of lipids\nare polymeric substances. Then why do lipids, whose molecular weights\ndo not exceed 800 Da, come under acid insoluble fraction, i.e.,\nmacromolecular fraction? Lipids are indeed small molecular weightPigments Carotenoids, Anthocyanins,\netc.\nAlkaloids Morphine, Codeine, etc.\nTerpenoides Monoterpenes, Diterpenes etc.\nEssential oils Lemon grass oil, etc.\nToxins Abrin, Ricin\nLectins Concanavalin A\nDrugs Vinblastin, curcumin, etc.\nPolymeric Rubber , gums, cellulose\nsubstancesTABLE 9.3  Some Secondary Metabolites\nReprint 2025-26\n\nBIOMOLECULES 109\nComponent % of the total\ncellular mass\nWater 70-90\nProteins 10-15\nCarbohydrates 3\nLipids 2\nNucleic acids 5-7\nIons 1TABLE 9.4  Average Composition of Cellscompounds and are present not only as such but also\narranged into structures like cell membrane and other\nmembranes. When we grind a tissue, we are disrupting\nthe cell structure. Cell membrane and other\nmembranes are broken into pieces, and form vesicles\nwhich are not water soluble. Therefore, these\nmembrane fragments in the form of vesicles get\nseparated along with the acid insoluble pool and hence\nin the macromolecular fraction. Lipids are not strictly\nmacromolecules.\nThe acid soluble pool represents roughly the\ncytoplasmic composition. The macromolecules from\ncytoplasm and organelles become the acid insoluble\nfraction. Together they represent the entire chemical\ncomposition of living tissues or organisms.\nIn summary if we represent the chemical\ncomposition of living tissue from abundance point of\nview and arrange them class-wise, we observe that\nwater is the most abundant chemical in living\norganisms (Table 9.4).\n9.4PROTEINS\nProteins are polypeptides. They are linear chains of\namino acids linked by peptide bonds as shown in\nFigure 9.3.\nEach protein is a polymer of amino acids. As there\nare 20 types of amino acids (e.g., alanine, cysteine,\nproline, tryptophan, lysine, etc.), a protein is a\nheter opolymer and not a homopolymer . A\nhomopolymer has only one type of monomer repeating\n‘n’ number of times. This information about the amino\nacid content is important as later in your nutrition\nlessons, you will learn that certain amino acids are\nessential for our health and they have to be supplied\nthrough our diet. Hence, dietary proteins are the\nsource of essential amino acids. Therefore, amino acids\ncan be essential or non-essential. The latter are those\nwhich our body can make, while we get essential amino\nacids through our diet/food. Proteins carry out many\nfunctions in living organisms, some transport\nnutrients across cell membrane, some fight infectious\norganisms, some are hormones, some are enzymes,TABLE 9.5 Some Proteins and their\nFunctions\nProtein Functions\nCollagen Intercellular ground\nsubstance\nTrypsin Enzyme\nInsulin Hormone\nAntibody Fights infectious agents\nReceptor Sensory reception\n(smell, taste, hormone,\netc.)\nGLUT -4 Enables glucose\ntransport\ninto cells\nReprint 2025-26\n\n110 BIOLOGY\nCH OH2 CH OH2\nCH2OHOH\nOH OH\nOHOO O\nOO O\nO\nO O O OOO\nFigure 9.2  Diagrammatic representation of a portion of glycogenetc. (Table 9.5). Collagen is the most abundant protein in animal world\nand Ribulose bisphosphate Carboxylase-Oxygenase (RuBisCO ) is the\nmost abundant protein in the whole of the biosphere.\n9.5POLYSACCHARIDES\nThe acid insoluble pellet also has polysaccharides (carbohydrates) as\nanother class of macromolecules. Polysaccharides are long chains of\nsugars. They are threads (literally a cotton thread) containing different\nmonosaccharides as building blocks. For example , cellulose is a\npolymeric polysaccharide consisting of only one type of monosaccharide\ni.e., glucose. Cellulose is a homopolymer . Star ch is a variant of this but\npresent as a store house of energy in plant tissues. Animals have another\nvariant called glycogen. Inulin is a polymer of fructose. In a\npolysaccharide chain (say glycogen), the right end is called the reducing\nend and the left end is called the non-reducing end. It has branches as\nshown in the form of a cartoon (Figure 9.2). Starch forms helical\nsecondary structures. In fact, starch can hold I2 molecules in the helical\nportion. The star ch-I2 is blue in colour . Cellulose does not contain\ncomplex helices and hence cannot hold I2.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nBIOMOLECULES 111\nPlant cell walls are made of cellulose. Paper made from plant pulp\nand cotton fibre is cellulosic. There are more complex polysaccharides\nin nature. They have as building blocks, amino-sugars and chemically\nmodified sugars (e.g., glucosamine, N-acetyl galactosamine, etc.).\nExoskeletons of arthropods, for example, have a complex\npolysaccharide called chitin. These complex polysaccharides are mostly\nhomopolymers.\n9.6NUCLEIC  ACIDS\nThe other type of macromolecule that one would find in the acid\ninsoluble fraction of any living tissue is the nucleic acid. These are\npolynucleotides. Together with polysaccharides and polypeptides these\ncomprise the true macromolecular fraction of any living tissue or cell.\nFor nucleic acids, the building block is a nucleotide. A nucleotide has\nthree chemically distinct components. One is a heterocyclic compound,\nthe second is a monosaccharide and the third a phosphoric acid or\nphosphate.\nAs you notice in Figure 9.1, the heterocyclic compounds in nucleic\nacids are the nitrogenous bases named adenine, guanine, uracil,\ncytosine, and thymine. Adenine and Guanine are substituted purines\nwhile the rest are substituted pyrimidines. The skeletal heterocyclic ring\nis called as purine and pyrimidine respectively. The sugar found in\npolynucleotides is either ribose (a monosaccharide pentose) or 2’\ndeoxyribose. A nucleic acid containing deoxyribose is called\ndeoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) while that which contains ribose is called\nribonucleic acid (RNA).\n9.7STRUCTURE  OF PROTEINS\nProteins, as mentioned earlier , are heter opolymers containing strings\nof amino acids. Structure of molecules means different things in\ndifferent contexts. In inorganic chemistry, the structure invariably\nrefers to the molecular formulae (e.g., NaCl, MgCl2, etc.). Organic\nchemists always write a two dimensional view of the molecules while\nrepresenting the structure of the molecules (e.g., benzene,\nnaphthalene, etc.). Physicists conjure up the three dimensional views\nof molecular structures while biologists describe the protein structure\nat four levels. The sequence of amino acids i.e., the positional\ninformation in a protein – which is the first amino acid, which is\nsecond, and so on – is called the primary structure  (Figure 9.3  a) of\na protein. A protein is imagined as a line, the left end represented by\nthe first amino acid and the right end represented by the last amino\nReprint 2025-26\n\n112 BIOLOGY\nacid. The first amino acid is also\ncalled as N-terminal amino acid. The\nlast amino acid is called the C-\nterminal amino acid. A protein\nthread does not exist throughout as\nan extended rigid rod. The thread is\nfolded in the form of a helix (similar\nto a revolving staircase). Of course,\nonly some portions of the protein\nthread are arranged in the form of a\nhelix. In proteins, only right handed\nhelices are observed. Other regions\nof the protein thread are folded into\nother forms in what is called the\nsecondary structure  (Fig. 9.3 b) . In\naddition, the long protein chain is\nalso folded upon itself like a hollow\nwoolen ball, giving rise to the\ntertiary structure  (Fig. 9.3 c). This\ngives us a 3-dimensional view of a\nprotein.  Tertiary  structure  is\nabsolutely necessary for the many\nbiological activities of proteins.\nSome proteins are an assembly of more than one polypeptide\nor subunits. The manner in which these individual folded\npolypeptides or subunits are arranged with respect to each other\n(e.g. linear string of spheres, spheres arranged one upon each\nother in the form of a cube or plate etc.) is the architecture of a\nprotein otherwise called the quaternary structure  of a protein\n(Fig. 9.3 d) . Adult human haemoglobin consists of 4 subunits.\nTwo of these are identical to each other . Hence, two subunits of α\ntype and two subunits of β type together constitute the human\nhaemoglobin (H b).\n9.8 ENZYMES\nAlmost all enzymes are proteins. There are some nucleic acids that behave\nlike enzymes. These are called ribozymes. One can depict an enzyme by a\nline diagram. An enzyme like any protein has a primary structure, i.e.,\namino acid sequence of the protein. An enzyme like any protein has the\nsecondary and the tertiary structure. When you look at a tertiary structure\nFigure 9.3 Various levels of Protein Structure(a) Primary\n(b) Secondary\n(d)     QuaternaryHydrogen bond\nDisulphide bondBeta–pleated sheetPolypeptide\nTertiaryAlpha–Helix\n(c)\nReprint 2025-26\n\nBIOMOLECULES 113\n← upon itself, the chain criss-crosses itself and hence, many crevices or\npockets are made. One such pocket is the ‘active site’. An active site of an\nenzyme is a crevice or pocket into which the substrate fits. Thus enzymes,\nthrough their active site, catalyse reactions at a high rate. Enzyme catalysts\ndiffer from inorganic catalysts in many ways, but one major difference\nneeds mention. Inorganic catalysts work efficiently at high temperatures\nand high pressures, while enzymes get damaged at high temperatures\n(say above 40°C). However , enzymes isolated from or ganisms who nor mally\nlive under extremely high temperatures (e.g., hot vents and sulphur\nsprings), are stable and retain their catalytic power even at high\ntemperatures (upto 80°-90°C). Thermal stability is thus an important\nquality of such enzymes isolated from thermophilic organisms.\n9.8.1 Chemical Reactions\nHow do we understand these enzymes? Let us first understand a chemical\nreaction. Chemical compounds undergo two types of changes. A physical\nchange simply refers to a change in shape without breaking of bonds.\nThis is a physical process. Another physical process is a change in state\nof matter: when ice melts into water , or when water becomes a vapour .\nThese ar e also physical pr ocesses. However , when bonds ar e broken and\nnew bonds are formed during transformation, this will be called a chemical\nreaction. For example:\nBa(OH)2 + H2SO4 → BaSO4 + 2H2O\nis an inorganic chemical reaction. Similarly, hydrolysis of starch into\nglucose is an organic chemical reaction. Rate of a physical or chemical\nprocess refers to the amount of product formed per unit time. It can be\nexpressed as:\nrate = δ\nδP\nt\nRate can also be called velocity if the direction is specified. Rates of physical\nand chemical processes are influenced by temperature among other\nfactors. A general rule of thumb is that rate doubles or decreases by half\nfor every 10°C change in either direction. Catalysed reactions proceed at\nrates vastly higher than that of uncatalysed ones. When enzyme catalysed\nreactions are observed, the rate would be vastly higher than the same\nbut uncatalysed reaction. For example\nCO2             +           H2O   →Carbonic anhydrase H2CO3\ncarbon dioxide water carbonic acid\nReprint 2025-26\n\n114 BIOLOGY\nIn the absence of any enzyme this reaction is very slow , with about\n200 molecules of H2CO3 being formed in an hour . However , by using\nthe enzyme present within the cytoplasm called carbonic anhydrase,\nthe reaction spe eds dramatically with about 600 ,000 molecules being\nformed every second. The enzyme has accelerated the reaction rate by\nabout 10 million times. The power of enzymes is incredible indeed!\nThere are thousands of types of enzymes each catalysing a unique\nchemical or metabolic reaction. A multistep chemical reaction, when\neach of the steps is catalysed by the same enzyme complex or dif ferent\nenzymes, is called a metabolic pathway . For example,\nGlucose →2 Pyruvic acid\nC6H12O6  +  O2 → 2C3H4 O3 + 2H2O\nis actually a metabolic pathway in which glucose becomes pyruvic acid\nthrough ten different enzyme catalysed metabolic reactions. When you\nstudy respiration in C hapter 12, you will study these reactions.  At this\nstage you should know that this very metabolic pathway with one or two\nadditional reactions gives rise to a variety of metabolic end products. In\nour skeletal muscle, under anaerobic conditions, lactic acid is formed.\nUnder normal aerobic conditions, pyruvic acid is formed. In yeast,  during\nfermentation, the same pathway leads to the production of ethanol\n(alcohol). Hence, in different conditions different products are possible.\n9.8.2 How do Enzymes bring about such High Rates of\nChemical Conversions?\nTo understand this we should study enzymes a little more. W e have already\nunderstood the idea of an ‘active site’. The chemical or metabolic conversion\nrefers to a reaction. The chemical which is converted into a product is\ncalled a ‘substrate’. Hence enzymes, i.e. proteins with three dimensional\nstructures including an ‘active site’, convert a substrate (S) into a product\n(P). Symbolically, this can be depicted as:\nS →P\nIt is now understo od that the substrate ‘S’ has to bind the enzyme at\nits ‘active site’ within a given cleft or pocket. The substrate has to dif fuse\ntowards the ‘active site’. There is thus, an obligatory formation of an ‘ES’\ncomplex. E stands for enzyme. This complex formation is a transient\nphenomenon. During the state where substrate is bound to the enzyme\nactive site, a new structure of the substrate called transition state structure\nis formed. V ery so on, after the expected bond breaking/making is\ncompleted, the product is released from the active site. In other words,\nthe structure of substrate gets transformed into the structure of product(s).\nThe pathway of this transformation must go through the so-called\nReprint 2025-26\n\nBIOMOLECULES 115\ntransition state structure. There could be many\nmore ‘altered structural states’ between the stable\nsubstrate and the product. Implicit in this\nstatement is the fact that all other intermediate\nstructural states are unstable. Stability is\nsomething related to energy status of the\nmolecule or the structure. Hence, when we look\nat this pictorially through a graph it looks like\nsomething as in Figure 9.4.\nThe y-axis represents the potential energy\ncontent. The x-axis represents the progression\nof the structural transformation or states\nthrough the ‘transition state’. Y ou would notice\ntwo things. The energy level difference between\nS and P . If ‘P’ is at a lower level than ‘S’, the r eaction\nis an exothermic reaction. One need not supply\nenergy (by heating) in order to form the product.\nHowever , whether it is an exother mic or spontaneous r eaction or an\nendothermic or energy requiring reaction, the ‘S’ has to go through a much\nhigher energy state or transition state. The difference in average energy content\nof ‘S’ from that of this transition state is called ‘activation energy’.\nEnzymes eventually bring down this energy barrier making the\ntransition of ‘S’ to ‘P’ more easy.\n9.8.3 Nature of Enzyme Action\nEach enzyme (E) has a substrate (S) binding site in its molecule so that a\nhighly reactive enzyme-substrate complex (ES) is produced. This\ncomplex is short-lived and dissociates into its product(s) P and the\nunchanged enzyme with an intermediate formation of the enzyme-product\ncomplex (EP).\nThe formation of the ES complex is essential for catalysis.\nE + S          ES   →   EP  →    E + P\nThe catalytic cycle of an enzyme action can be described in the following\nsteps:\n1.First, the substrate binds to the active site of the enzyme, fitting\ninto the active site.\n2.The binding of the substrate induces the enzyme to alter its shape,\nfitting more tightly around the substrate.\n3.The active site of the enzyme, now in close proximity of the\nsubstrate breaks the chemical bonds of the substrate and the\nnew enzyme- product complex is formed.Activation□energy\nwithout□enzymePotential□En\nergy\nActivation\nenergy□with□enzyme\nSubstrate□(s)\nProduct□(P)\nProgress□of□reactionTransition□state\nFigure  9.4  Concept of activation energy\nReprint 2025-26\n\n116 BIOLOGY\n4.The enzyme releases the products of the reaction and the free\nenzyme is ready to bind to another molecule of the substrate and\nrun through the catalytic cycle once again.\n9.8.4 Factors Affecting Enzyme Activity\nThe activity of an enzyme can be affected by a change in the conditions\nwhich can alter the tertiary structure of the protein. These include\ntemperature, pH, change in substrate concentration or binding of specific\nchemicals that regulate its activity.\nTemperature and pH\nEnzymes generally function in a narrow range of temperature and pH\n(Figure 9.5). Each enzyme shows its highest activity at a particular\ntemperature and pH called the optimum temperature and optimum pH.\nActivity declines both below and above the optimum value. Low\ntemperature preserves the enzyme in a temporarily inactive state whereas\nhigh temperature destroys enzymatic activity because proteins are\ndenatured by heat.\nConcentration of Substrate\nWith the increase in substrate concentration, the velocity of the enzymatic\nreaction rises at first. The reaction ultimately reaches a maximum velocity\n(Vmax) which is not exceeded by any further rise in concentration of the\nsubstrate. This is because the enzyme molecules are fewer than the\nsubstrate molecules and after saturation of these molecules, there are no\nfree enzyme molecules to bind with the additional substrate molecules\n(Figure 9.5).\nThe activity of an enzyme is also sensitive to the presence of specific\nchemicals that bind to the enzyme. When the binding of the chemical\nFigure 9.5 Effect of change in : (a) pH  (b) Temperature and (c) Concentration of\nsubstrate on enzyme activityVmaxVelocity of r\neaction\n(V)\n[S]V\n2max\nKm(a) (b) (c)\npH Temperature\nEnzyme activity\nReprint 2025-26\n\nBIOMOLECULES 117\nshuts off enzyme activity, the process is called inhibition  and the chemical\nis called an inhibitor .\nWhen the inhibitor closely resembles the substrate in its molecular\nstructure and inhibits the activity of the enzyme, it is known as\ncompetitive inhibitor . Due to its close structural similarity with the\nsubstrate, the inhibitor competes with the substrate for the substrate-\nbinding site of the enzyme. Consequently, the substrate cannot bind and\nas a result, the enzyme action declines, e.g., inhibition of succinic\ndehydrogenase by malonate which closely resembles the substrate\nsuccinate in structure. Such competitive inhibitors are often used in the\ncontrol of bacterial pathogens.\n9.8.5 Classification and Nomenclature of Enzymes\nThousands of enzymes have been discovered, isolated and studied. Most\nof these enzymes have been classified into different groups based on the\ntype of reactions they catalyse. Enzymes are divided into 6 classes each\nwith 4-13 subclasses and named accordingly by a four -digit number .\nOxidoreductases/dehydrogenases:  Enzymes which catalyse\noxidoreduction between two substrates S and S’ e.g.,\nS reduced + S’ oxidised  →   S oxidised + S’ reduced.\nTransferases:  Enzymes catalysing a transfer of a group, G (other than\nhydrogen) between a pair of substrate S and S’ e.g.,\nS - G + S’   →   S + S’ - G\nHydrolases:  Enzymes catalysing hydr olysis of ester , ether , peptide,\nglycosidic, C-C, C-halide or P-N bonds.\nLyases:  Enzymes that catalyse removal of groups from substrates by\nmechanisms other than hydrolysis leaving double bonds.\nIsomerases:  Includes all enzymes catalysing inter -conversion of optical,\ngeometric or positional isomers.\nLigases:  Enzymes catalysing the linking together of 2 compounds, e.g.,\nenzymes which catalyse joining of C-O, C-S, C-N,  P-O etc. bonds.\n9.8.6 Co-factors\nEnzymes ar e composed of one or several polypeptide chains. However ,\nthere are a number of cases in which non-protein constituents called co-\nfactors are bound to the the enzyme to make the enzyme catalytically\nReprint 2025-26\n\n118 BIOLOGY\nactive. In these instances, the protein portion of the enzymes is called the\napoenzyme. Three kinds of cofactors may be identified: prosthetic groups,\nco-enzymes and metal ions.\nProsthetic groups are organic compounds and are distinguished from\nother cofactors in that they are tightly bound to the apoenzyme. For\nexample, in peroxidase and catalase, which catalyze the breakdown of\nhydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen, haem is the prosthetic group\nand it is a part of the active site of the enzyme.\nCo-enzymes are also organic compounds but their association with\nthe apoenzyme is only transient, usually occurring during the course of\ncatalysis. Furthermore, co-enzymes serve as co-factors in a number of\ndifferent enzyme catalyzed reactions. The essential chemical components\nof many coenzymes are vitamins, e.g., coenzyme nicotinamide adenine\ndinucleotide (NAD) and NADP contain the vitamin niacin.\nA number of enzymes require metal ions for their activity which form\ncoordination bonds with side chains at the active site and at the same\ntime form one or more cordination bonds with the substrate, e.g., zinc is\na cofactor for the proteolytic enzyme carboxypeptidase.\nCatalytic  activity is lost when the co-factor is removed from the enzyme\nwhich testifies that they play a crucial role in the catalytic activity of the\nenzyme.\nSUMMARY\nAlthough there is a bewildering diversity of living organisms, their chemical\ncomposition and metabolic r eactions appear to be r emarkably similar . The\nelemental composition of living tissues and non-living matter appear also to be\nsimilar when analysed qualitatively. However , a closer examination reveals that\nthe relative abundance of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen is higher in living systems\nwhen compar ed to inanimate matter . The most abundant chemical in living\norganisms is water . Ther e are thousands of small molecular weight (<1000 Da)\nbiomolecules. Amino acids, monosaccharide and disaccharide sugars, fatty acids,\nglycerol, nucleotides, nucleosides and nitrogen bases are some of the organic\ncompounds seen in living organisms. There are 20 types of amino acids and 5\ntypes of nucleotides. Fats and oils are glycerides in which fatty acids are esterified\nto glycerol. Phospholipids contain, in addition, a phosphorylated nitrogenous\ncompound.\nOnly three types of macromolecules , i.e., proteins, nucleic acids and\npolysaccharides are found in living systems. Lipids, because of their association\nwith membranes separate in the macromolecular fraction. Biomacromolecules\nare polymers. They are made of building blocks which are different. Proteins\nare heteropolymers made of amino acids. Nucleic acids (RNA and DNA) are\ncomposed of nucleotides. Biomacromolecules have a hierarchy of structures  –\nReprint 2025-26\n\nBIOMOLECULES 119\nprimary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary. Nucleic acids serve as genetic\nmaterial. Polysaccharides are components of cell wall in plants, fungi and also\nof the exoskeleton of arthropods. They also are storage forms of energy (e.g. ,\nstarch and glycogen). Proteins serve a variety of cellular functions. Many of\nthem are enzymes, some are antibodies, some are receptors, some are hormones\nand some others are structural proteins. Collagen is the most abundant protein\nin animal world and Ribulose bisphosphate Carboxylase-Oxygenase ( RuBisCO )\nis the most abundant protein in the whole of the biosphere.\nEnzymes are proteins which catalyse biochemical reactions in the cells.\nRibozymes ar e nucleic acids with catalytic power . Proteinaceous enzymes exhibit\nsubstrate specificity, require optimum temperature and pH for maximal activity.\nThey are denatured at high temperatures. Enzymes lower activation energy of\nreactions and enhance greatly the rate of the reactions. Nucleic acids carry\nhereditary information and are passed on from parental generation to progeny.\nEXERCISES\n1.What are macromolecules?
