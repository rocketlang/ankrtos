She cut this strip into four equal parts. How did she\ndo it? She folded the strip twice. What fraction of the total length will each part represent?\nEach part will be 9\n4 of the strip. She took one part and divided it in two equal parts by\n2024-25\n\nMATHEMA TICS 26\nfolding the part once. What will one of the pieces represent? It will represent 1\n2 of 9\n4 or\n1\n2 × 9\n4.\nLet us now see how to find the product of two fractions like 1\n2 × 9\n4.\nTo do this we first learn to find the products like 1\n2 × 1\n3.\n(a)How do we find  1\n3of a whole? We divide the whole in three equal parts. Each of\nthe three parts represents 1\n3of the whole. Take one part of these three parts, and\nshade it as shown in Fig 2.8.\n(b) How will you find 1\n2of this shaded part? Divide this one-third (1\n3) shaded part into\ntwo equal parts. Each of these two parts represents 1\n2 of  1\n3 i.e., 1\n2 × 1\n3(Fig 2.9).\n        Take out 1 part of these two and name it ‘A ’. ‘A’ represents 1\n2 × 1\n3.\n(c)What fraction is ‘A ’ of the whole? For this, divide each of the remaining 1\n3 parts also\nin two equal parts. How many such equal parts do you have now?\nThere are six such equal parts. ‘A ’ is one of these parts.\nSo, ‘A ’ is 1\n6 of the whole. Thus,  1\n2 × 1\n3  =  1\n6.\nHow did we decide that ‘A ’ was 1\n6 of the whole? The whole was divided in 6 = 2 × 3\nparts and 1 = 1 × 1 part was taken out of it.\nThus,1\n2 × 1\n3 =1\n6  = 1×1\n2×3\nor1\n2 × 1\n3 =1×1\n2×3Fig 2.8\nFig 2.9A\n2024-25\n\nFRACTIONS AND DECIMALS 27\nThe value of 1\n3×1\n2 can be found in a similar way . Divide the whole into two equal\nparts and then  divide one of these parts in three equal parts. Take one of these parts. This\nwill represent  1\n3 × 1\n2 i.e., 1\n6.\nTherefore1\n3× 1\n2 =1\n6 = 1×1\n3× 2 as discussed earlier .\nHence1\n2 × 1\n3 =1\n3× 1\n2= 1\n6\nFind  1\n3×1\n4 and 1\n4 × 1\n3; 1\n2× 1\n5  and  1\n5× 1\n2 and check whether you get\n1\n3×1\n4 =1\n4 × 1\n3;  1\n2× 1\n5 = 1\n5× 1\n2\nFill in these boxes:\n(i)1\n2 × 1\n7 =  1×1\n2 × 7 = (ii)1\n5× 1\n7   =   = \n(iii)1\n7 × 1\n2   =  = (iv)1\n7 × 1\n5 =  = \nEXAMPLE  2Sushant reads 1\n3 part of a book in 1 hour .

How much money should\nshe pay? Certainly it would be ` (8.50 × 1.50). Both 8.5 and 1.5 are decimal numbers.\nSo, we have come across a situation where we need to know how to multiply two deci-\nmals. Let us now learn the multiplication of two decimal numbers.\nFirst we find 0.1 × 0.1.\nNow , 0.1 = 1\n10. So, 0.1 × 0.1 = 1 1×10 10 =\n1×1\n10 ×10 = 1\n100 = 0.01.\nLet us see it’ s pictorial representation (Fig 2.13)\nThe fraction 1\n10 represents 1 part out of 10 equal\nparts.\nFig 2.13\n2024-25\n\nFRACTIONS AND DECIMALS 35\nThe shaded part in the picture represents 1\n10.\nWe know that,\n1 1×10 10 means 1\n10 of 1\n10. So, divide this 1\n10th part into 10 equal parts and take one\npart out of it.\nThus, we have, (Fig 2.14).\n        \nFig 2.14\nThe dotted square is one part out of 10 of the 1\n10th part. That is, it represents\n1 1×10 10 or  0.1 × 0.1.\nCan the dotted square be represented in some other way?\nHow many small squares do you find in Fig 2.14?\nThere are 100 small squares. So the dotted square represents one out of 100 or 0.01.\nHence, 0.1 × 0.1 = 0.01.\nNote that 0.1 occurs two times in the product. In 0.1 there is\none digit to the right of the decimal point. In 0.01 there are two\ndigits (i.e., 1 + 1) to the right of the decimal point.\nLet us now find 0.2 × 0.3.\nWe have, 0.2 × 0.3 = 2 3×10 10\nAs we did for 1 1\n10 10×, let us divide the square into 10 equal\nparts and take three parts out of it, to get 3\n10. Again divide each\nFig 2.15\n2024-25\n\nMATHEMA TICS 36\nTRY THESEof these three equal parts into 10 equal parts and take two from each. We get 2 3×10 10.\nThe dotted squares represent 2 3×10 10 or 0.2 × 0.3. (Fig 2.15)\nSince there are 6 dotted squares out of 100, so they also reprsent 0.06.\nThus, 0.2 × 0.3 = 0.06.\nObserve that 2 × 3 = 6 and the number of digits to the right of the decimal point in 0.06\nis 2 (= 1 + 1).\nCheck whether this applies to 0.1 ×  0.1 also.\nFind 0.2 ×  0.4 by applying these observations.\nWhile finding 0.1 × 0.1 and 0.2 × 0.3, you might have noticed that first we multiplied\nthem as whole numbers ignoring the decimal point. In 0.1 × 0.1, we found 01 × 01 or 1 ×\n1. Similarly in 0.2 × 0.3 we found 02 ×\n 03 or 2 × 3.\nThen, we counted the number of digits starting from the rightmost digit and moved\ntowards left. We then put the decimal point there. The number of digits to be counted is\nobtained by adding the number of digits to the right of the decimal point in the decimal\nnumbers that are being multiplied.\nLet us now find 1.2 × 2.5.\nMultiply 12 and 25. We get 300. Both, in 1.2 and 2.5, there is 1 digit to the right of the\ndecimal point. So, count 1 + 1 = 2 digits from the rightmost digit (i.e., 0) in 300 and move\ntowards left. We get 3.00 or 3.\nFind in a similar way 1.5 × 1.6, 2.4 × 4.2.\nWhile multiplying 2.5 and 1.25, you will first multiply 25 and 125. For placing the\ndecimal in the product obtained, you will count 1 + 2 = 3 (Why?) digits starting from the\nrightmost digit. Thus, 2.5 × 1.25 = 3.225\nFind 2.7 × 1.35.\n   1. Find: (i) 2.7 × 4 (ii) 1.8 × 1.2 (iii) 2.3 × 4.35\n   2. Arrange the products obtained in (1) in descending order .\nEXAMPLE  3 The side of an equilateral triangle is 3.5 cm. Find its perimeter .\nSOLUTION All the sides of an equilateral triangle are equal.\n2024-25\n\nFRACTIONS AND DECIMALS 37\nSo, length of each side = 3.5 cm\nThus, perimeter = 3 × 3.5 cm = 10.5 cm\nEXAMPLE  4 The length of a rectangle is 7.1 cm and its breadth is 2.5 cm.\nWhat is the area of the rectangle?\nSOLUTION Length of the rectangle = 7.1 cm\nBreadth of the rectangle = 2.5 cm\nTherefore, area of the rectangle = 7.1 × 2.5 cm2 = 17.75 cm2\n2.3.1 Multiplication of Decimal Numbers by 10, 100 and 1000\nReshma observed that 2.3 = 23\n10 whereas 2.35 = 235\n100. Thus, she found that depending\non the position of the decimal point the decimal number can be converted to a fraction with\ndenominator 10 or 100. She wondered what would happen if a decimal number is multiplied\nby 10 or 100 or 1000.\nLet us see if we can find a pattern of multiplying numbers by 10 or 100 or 1000.\nHave a look at the table given below and fill in the blanks:\n1.76 × 10  = 176\n100× 10 = 17.6 2.35 ×10 =___ 12.356 × 10 =___\n1.76 × 100 = 176\n100× 100 = 176 or 176.0 2.35 ×100 = ___ 12.356 × 100 =___\n1.76 × 1000 = 176\n100 × 1000 = 1760   or 2.35 ×1000 = ___ 12.356 × 1000 = ___\n                                                1760.0\n0.5 × 10 = 5\n10 × 10 = 5     ;     0.5 × 100 = ___     ;     0.5 × 1000 = ___\nObserve t he shift of the decimal point of the products in the table. Here the numbers are\nmultiplied by 10,100 and 1000. In 1.76 × 10 = 17.6, the digits are same i.e., 1, 7 and 6.  Do\nyou observe this in other products also? Observe 1.76 and 17.6. To which side has the\ndecimal point shifted, right or left? The decimal point has shifted to the right by one place.\nNote that 10 has one zero over 1.\nIn 1.76×100 = 176.0, observe 1.76 and 176.0. To which side and by how many\ndigits has the decimal point shifted? The decimal point has shifted to the right by two\nplaces.\nNote that 100 has two zeros over one.\nDo you observe similar shifting of decimal point in other products also?\n2024-25\n\nMATHEMA TICS 38\nSo we say , when a decimal number is multiplied by 10, 100 or 1000, the digits in\nthe pr oduct ar e same as in the decimal number but the decimal point in the pr oduct\nis shifted to the right by as, many of places as ther e are zer os over one.\nBased on these observations we can now say\n0.07 × 10 = 0.7, 0.07 × 100 = 7 and 0.07 × 1000 = 70.\nCan you now tell 2.97 × 10 = ?    2.97 × 100 = ?    2.97 × 1000 = ?\nCan yo u now help Reshma to find the total amount i.e., ` 8.50 ×\n150, that she has to pay?\nEXERCISE  2.4\n1.Find:\n(i)0.2 × 6 (ii)8 × 4.6 (iii) 2.71 × 5 (iv) 20.1 × 4\n(v)0.05 × 7 (vi) 211.02 × 4 (vii) 2 × 0.86\n2.Find the area of rectangle whose length is 5.7cm and breadth is 3 cm.\n3.Find:\n(i)1.3 × 10 (ii)36.8 × 10 (iii) 153.7 × 10 (iv) 168.07 × 10\n(v)31.1 × 100 (vi) 156.1 × 100 (vii) 3.62 × 100 (viii) 43.07 × 100\n(ix) 0.5 × 10 (x)0.08 × 10 (xi) 0.9 × 100 (xii) 0.03 × 1000\n4.A two-wheeler covers a distance of 55.3 km in one litre of petrol.

She thought it would\nbe 9.5\n1.9cm. Is she correct?\nBoth 9.5 and 1.9 are decimal numbers. So we need to know the division of\ndecimal numbers too!\n2.4.1  Division by 10, 100 and 1000\nLet us find the division of a decimal number by 10, 100 and 1000.\nConsider  31.5 ÷ 10.TRY THESE\nFind: (i)0.3 × 10\n(ii)1.2 × 100\n(iii) 56.3 × 1000\n2024-25\n\nFRACTIONS AND DECIMALS 39\n31.5 ÷  10 = 315 1×10 10 = 315\n100 = 3.15\nSimilarly , 315 131.5 10010 100÷ = ×  = =315\n10000 315 .\nLet us see if we can find a pattern for dividing numbers by 10, 100 or 1000.

In 31.5 and 3.15, the digits are\nsame i.e., 3, 1, and 5 but the decimal point has shifted in the\nquotient. To which side and by how many digits? The decimal\npoint has shifted to the left by one place. Note that 10 has one\nzero over 1.\nConsider now 31. 5 ÷100 = 0.315. In 31.5 and 0.315 the\ndigits are same, but what about the decimal point in the quotient?\nIt has shifted to the left by two places. Note that 100 has two\nzeros over1.\nSo we can say that, while dividing a number by 10, 100 or 1000, the digits of the\nnumber and the quotient ar e same but the decimal point in the quotient shifts to the\nleft by as many places as ther e are zer os over 1.  Using this observation let us now\nquickly find:        2.3 8 ÷ 10 = 0.238,  2.3 8 ÷ 100 = 0.0238, 2.3 8÷ 1000 = 0.00238\n2.4.2  Division of a Decimal Number by a Whole Number\nLet us find 6.4\n2.

We get 32. There is one digit to the right of the decimal\npoint in 6.4. Place the decimal in 32 such that there would be one digit to its\nright. We get 3.2 again.\nTo find 19.5 ÷ 5, first find 195 ÷5. We get 39. There is one digit to the\nright of the decimal point in 19.5. Place the decimal point in 39 such that there\nwould be one digit to its right.

You get 324. There are two digits to the right of\nthe decimal in 12.96. Making similar placement of the decimal in 324, you\nwill get 3.24.\nNote that here and in the next section, we have considered only those divisions in\nwhich, ignoring the decimal, the number would be completely divisible by another number\nto give remainder zero. Like, in 19.5 ÷ 5, the number 195 when divided by 5, leaves\nremainder zero.\nHowever , there are situations in which the number may not be completely divisible by\nanother number , i.e., we may not get remainder zero.

Add the number of digits counted.\nPut the decimal point in the product by counting the digits from its rightmost place.\nThe count should be the sum obtained earlier .\nFor example, 0.5 × 0.7 = 0.35\n2024-25\n\nFRACTIONS AND DECIMALS 43\n7.To multiply a decimal number by 10, 100 or 1000, we move the decimal point in the\nnumber to the right by as many places as there are zeros over 1.\nThus  0.53 × 10 = 5.3,     0.53 × 100 = 53,      0.53 × 1000 = 530\n8.We have seen how to divide decimal numbers.\n(a)To divide a decimal number by a whole number , we first divide them as whole\nnumbers. Then place the decimal point in the quotient as in the decimal number .\nFor example, 8.4 ÷ 4 = 2.1\nNote that here we consider only those divisions in which the remainder is zero.\n(b) To divide a decimal number by 10, 100 or 1000, shift the digits in the decimal\nnumber to the left by as many places as there are zeros over 1, to get the\nquotient.\nSo, 23.9 ÷ 10 = 2.39, 23.9 ÷ 100 = 0 .239, 23.9 \n÷ 1000 = 0.0239\n(c)While dividing two decimal numbers, first shift the decimal point to the right by\nequal number of places in both, to convert the divisor to a whole number . Then\ndivide. Thus, 2.4 ÷  0.2 = 24 ÷ 2 = 12.\n2024-25\n\n",
