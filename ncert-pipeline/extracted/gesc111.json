Role play\nHere is a game that a group of children can play. One child will bechosen to act as object and another will act as the image of the object.The object and the image will sit opposite to each other. The object willmake movements, such as raising a hand, touching an ear etc. Theimage will have to make the correct movement following the movementof the object. The rest of the group will watch the movements of theimage. If the image fails to make the correct movement, she/he will beretired. Another child will take her/his place and the game willcontinue. A scoring scheme can be introduced. The group that scoresthe maximum will be declared the winner.\nReprint 2024-25\n\nLIGHT 141Did you know?\nThe mirrors can be used as weapons. Archimedes, a Greek scientist, is said\nto have done just that more than two thousand years ago. When theRomans attacked Syracuse, a coastal city-state in Greece, Archimedes usedmirrors arranged as shown in Fig. 11.34. The mirrors could be moved in anydirection. They were positioned such that they reflected the sunlight on theRoman soldiers. The soldiers were dazzled by the sunlight. They did notknow what was happening. They got confused and ran away. This was anexample of triumph of ideas over military might.\nFig. 11.34  Archimedes mirrors\nReprint 2024-25\n\n",
