In this case there are 9 letters, in which I appears 2 times and T appears\n3 times.\nTemporarily , let us treat these letters dif ferent and name them as I1, I2, T1,  T2, T3.\nThe number of permutations of 9 different letters, in this case, taken all at a time is 9 !.\nConsider one such permutation, say , I1 NT1 SI2 T2 U E T3.  Here if I1, I2 are not same\nReprint 2025-26\n\n110       MA THEMA TICS\nand T1, T2, T3 are not same, then I1, I2 can be arranged in 2! ways and T1, T2, T3 can\nbe arranged in 3! ways.

We, first, have to\nReprint 2025-26\n\n   PERMUTATION S AND COMBINATIONS       111\ncount the permutati ons of 6 digits taken 3 at a time. This number would be 6P3. But,\nthese permutations will include those also where 0 is at the 100’ s place. For example,\n092, 042, . . ., etc are such numbers which are actually 2-digit numbers and hence the\nnumber of such numbers has to be subtracted from 6P3 to get the required number . To\nget the number of such numbers, we fix 0 at the 100’ s place and rearrange the remaining\n5 digits taking 2 at a time. This number is 5P2.

Since the vowels have to occur together , we can for\nthe time being, assume them as a single object (AUE). This single object together with\n5 remaining letters (objects) will be counted as 6 objects. Then we count permutations\nof these 6 objects taken all at a time. This number would be 6P6 = 6!. Corresponding to\neach of these permutations, we shall have 3! permutations of the three vowels A, U, E\ntaken all at a time . Hence, by the multiplication principle the required number of\npermutations = 6 ! × 3 ! = 4320.\n(ii) If we have to count those permutations in which all vowels are never\ntogether , we first have to find all possible arrangments of 8 letters taken all  at a time,\nwhich can be done in 8! ways. Then, we have to subtract from this number , the number\nof permutations in which the vowels are always together .\nTherefore, the required number 8 ! – 6 ! × 3 ! =6 ! (7×8 – 6)\n=2 × 6 !

Therefore\nThe required number of arrangements  12!16632003! 4! 2!= =\n  (i) Let us fix P at the extreme left position, we, then, count the arrangements of the\nremaining 1 1 letters.

How do\nwe determine the number of hand shakes. X shaking hands with Y and  Y with X will\nnot be two different hand shakes. Here, order is not important.

Taking 2 at a time, if we have\nto make combinations, these will be AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD. Here,  AB and BA  are\nthe same combination as order does not alter the combination. This is why we have not\nincluded BA, CA, DA, CB, DB and DC in this list. There are as many as 6 combinations\nof 4 different objects taken 2 at a time, i.e., 4C2 = 6.\nCorresponding to each combination in the list, we can arrive at 2! permutations as\n2 objects in each combination can be rearranged in 2! ways. Hence, the number of\npermutations = 4C2 × 2!.\nOn the other hand, the number of permutations of 4 different things taken 2 at\na time = 4P2.\nTherefore4P2 = 4C2 × ×××× 2!   or   ( )4\n24!C4 2 ! 2!=−\nNow , let us suppose t hat we have 5 dif ferent objects A, B, C, D, E. Taking 3 at a\ntime, if we have to make combinations, these will be ABC, ABD, ABE, BCD, BCE,\nCDE, ACE, ACD, ADE, BDE. Corresponding to each of these 5C3 combinations, there\nare 3! permutations, because, the thr\nee objects in each combination can beFig. 6.3\nReprint 2025-26\n\n116       MA THEMA TICS\nrearranged in 3 ! ways. Therefore, the total of permutations = 5\n3C 3!×\nTherefore      5P3 = 5C3 × 3!     or( )5\n35!C5 3 ! 3!=−\nThese examples suggest the following theorem showing relationship between\npermutaion and combination:\nTheorem 5  P C !n n\nr r r = , 0 < r ≤ n.\nProof  Corresponding to each combination of nCr, we  have r ! permutations, because\nr objects in every combination can be rearranged in r ! ways.\nHence, the total number of permutations of n different things taken r at a time\nis nCr × r!.

Taking 2 at a time, if we have\nto make combinations, these will be AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD. Here,  AB and BA  are\nthe same combination as order does not alter the combination. This is why we have not\nincluded BA, CA, DA, CB, DB and DC in this list. There are as many as 6 combinations\nof 4 different objects taken 2 at a time, i.e., 4C2 = 6.\nCorresponding to each combination in the list, we can arrive at 2! permutations as\n2 objects in each combination can be rearranged in 2! ways. Hence, the number of\npermutations = 4C2 × 2!.\nOn the other hand, the number of permutations of 4 different things taken 2 at\na time = 4P2.\nTherefore4P2 = 4C2 × ×××× 2!   or   ( )4\n24!C4 2 ! 2!=−\nNow , let us suppose t hat we have 5 dif ferent objects A, B, C, D, E.

If these words are written as in a dictionary ,\nwhat will be the 50th word ?\nSolution  There are 5 letters in the word AGAIN, in which A appears 2 times. \nTherefore,\nthe required number of words = 5!602!= .\nTo get the number of words starting with A, we fix the letter A at the extreme left\nposition, we then rearrange the remaining 4 letters taken all at a time. There will be as\nmany arrangements of these 4 letters taken 4 at a time as there are permutations of 4\ndifferent things taken 4 at a time. Hence, the number of words starting with\nA =  4! = 24. Then, starting with G, the number of words 4!\n2!= = 12 as after placing G\nat the extreme left position, we are left with the letters A, A, I and N.

Therefore, the numbers to be counted will be 7-digit only . Also, the numbers have to\nbe greater than 1000000, so they can b egin either with 1, 2 or 4.\nThe number of numbers beginning with 1 = 6! 4 5 6\n3! 2! 2× ×= = 60, as when 1 is\nfixed at the extreme left position, the remaining digits to be rearranged will be 0, 2, 2, 2,\n4, 4, in which there are 3,  2 s and 2, 4 s.\nTotal numbers begining with 2\n= 6! 3 4 5 6\n2! 2! 2× × ×=  = 180\nand total numbers begining with 4 6!4 5 63!= = × ×  = 120\nReprint 2025-26\n\n122       MA THEMA TICS\nTherefore, the required number of numbers  = 60 + 180 + 120 = 360.\nAlternative Method\nThe number of 7-digit arrangements, clearly , 7!4203! 2!= .

The credit, however , goes to the\nJains who treated its subject matter as a self-contained topic in mathematics,\nunder the name Vikalpa .\nAmong the Jains, Mahavira , (around 850) is perhaps the world’ s first\nmathematician credited with providing the general formulae for permutations and\ncombinations.\nIn the 6th century B.C., Sushruta, in his medicinal work, \nSushruta Samhita,\nasserts that 63 combinations can be made out of 6 different tastes, taken one at a\ntime, two at a time, etc. Pingala, a Sanskrit scholar around third century B.C.,\ngives the method of determining the number of combinations of a given number\nof letters, taken one at a time, two at a time, etc. in his work Chhanda Sutra .\nBhaskarachar ya (born 1 114) treated the subject matter of permutations and\ncombinations under the name Anka Pasha  in his famous work Lilavati.  In addition\nto the general formulae for nCr and nPr already provided by Mahavira,\nBhaskaracharya  gives several important theorems and results concerning the\nsubject.\nOutside India, the subject matter of permutations and combinations had its\nhumble beginnings in China in the famous book I–King (Book of changes). It is\ndifficult to give the approximate time of this work, since in 213 B.C., the emperor\nhad ordered all books and manuscripts in the country to be burnt which fortunately\nwas not completely carried out. Greeks and later Latin writers also did some\nscattered work on the theory of permutations and combinations.\nSome Arabic and Hebrew writers used the concepts of permutations and\ncombinations in studying astronomy . Rabbi ben Ezra,  for instance, determined\nthe number of combinations of known planets taken two at a time, three at a time\nand so on. This was around 1 140. It appears that Rabbi ben Ezra  did not know\nReprint 2025-26\n\n   PERMUTATION S AND COMBINATIONS       125\nthe formula for nCr. However , he was aware that  nCr =  nCn–r for specific values\nn and r. In 1321, Levi Ben Gerson , another Hebrew writer came up with the\nformulae for nPr , nPn and the general formula for nCr.\nThe first book which gives a complete treatment of the subject matter of\npermutations and combinations is Ars Conjectandi written by a Swiss,  Jacob\nBernoulli (1654 – 1705), posthumously published in 1713. This book contains\nessentially the theory of permutations and combinations as is known today .\n—v\nvv vv—\nReprint 2025-26\n\n",
