      "content": "Chapter 5, you would\nhave studied the axioms and postulates of Euclid. (W e do not distinguish between\naxioms and postulates these days.)\nFor example, the first postulate of Euclid states:\nA straight line may be drawn fr om any point to any other point.\nAnd the third postulate states:\nA circle may be drawn with any centr e and any radius.\nThese statements appear to be perfectly true and Euclid assumed them to be true.\nWhy? This is because we cannot prove everything and we need to start somewhere.\nWe need some statements which we accept as true and then we can build up our\nknowledge using the rules of logic based on these axioms.\nYou might then wonder why we don’ t just accept all statements to be true when\nthey appear self-evident. There are many reasons for this. Very often our intuition can\nbe wrong, pictures or patterns can deceive and the only way to be sure that something\nis true is to prove it.  For example, many of us believe that if a number is multiplied by\nanother , the result will be lar ger than both the numbers. But we know that this is not\nalways true: for example, 5 × 0.2 = 1, which is less than 5.\nAlso, look at the Fig. A1.3. Which line segment is longer , AB or CD?\nFig. A1.3\nIt turns out that both are of exactly the same length, even though AB appears\nshorter!\nYou might wonder then, about the validity of axioms. Axioms have been chosen\nbased on our intuition and what appears to be self-evident. Therefore, we expect them\nto be true. However , it is possible that later on we discover that a particular axiom is\nnot true. What is a safeguard against this possibility? We take the following steps:\n(i)Keep the axioms to the bare minimum. For instance, based on only axioms\nand five postulates of Euclid, we can derive hundreds of theorems.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n178 MATHEMA TICS\n(ii)Make sure the axioms are consistent.\nWe say a collection of axioms is inconsistent,  if we can use one axiom to\nshow that another axiom is not true. For example, consider the following two\nstatements. We will show that they are inconsistent.\nStatement1: No whole number is equal to its successor .\nStatement 2: A whole number divided by zero is a whole number .\n(Remember , division by zer o is not defined . But just for the moment, we\nassume that it is possible, and see what happens.)\nFrom Statement 2, we get 1\n0 = a , where a is some whole number . This\nimplies that, 1 = 0. But this disproves Statement 1, which states that no whole\nnumber is equal to its successor .\n(iii)A false axiom will, sooner or later , result in a contradiction. We say that there\nis a contradiction, when we find a statement such that, both the statement\nand its negation ar e true. For example, consider Statement 1 and Statement\n2 above once again.\nFrom Statement 1, we can derive the result that 2 ≠ 1.\nNow look at x2 – x2. We will factorise it in two dif ferent ways as follows:\n(i)x2 – x2 = x(x – x) and\n(ii)x2 – x2 = (x + x)(x – x)\nSo, x(x – x) = (x + x)(x – x).\nFrom Statement 2, we can cancel ( x – x) from both sides.\nWe get x = 2x, which in turn implies 2 = 1.\nSo we have both the statement 2 ≠ 1 and its negation, 2 = 1, true. This is a\ncontradiction. The contradiction arose because of the false axiom, that a whole number\ndivided by zero is a whole number .\nSo, the statements we choose as axioms require a lot of thought and insight. We\nmust make sure they do not lead to inconsistencies or logical contradictions.  Moreover ,\nthe choice of axioms themselves, sometimes leads us to new discoveries. From Chapter\n5, you are familiar with Euclid’ s fifth postulate and the discoveries of non-Euclidean\ngeometries. You saw that mathematicians believed that the fifth postulate need not be\na postulate and is actually a theorem that can be proved using just the first four\npostulates. Amazingly these attempts led to the discovery of non-Euclidean geometries.\nWe end the section by recalling the dif ferences between an axiom, a theorem and\na conjecture. An axiom  is a mathematical statement which is assumed to be true\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPROOFS  IN MATHEMA TICS 179\nwithout proof; a conjecture  is a mathematical statement whose truth or falsity is yet\nto be established; and a theorem  is a mathematical statement whose truth has been\nlogically established.\nEXERCISE A1.3\n1.Take any three consecutive even numbers and find their product; for example,\n2 × 4 × 6 = 48, 4 × 6 ×  8 = 192, and so on. Make three conjectures about these products.\n2.Go back to Pascal’ s triangle.\nLine 1 : 1 = 110\nLine 2 :  1  1 = 111\nLine 3 : 1  2  1 = 112\nMake a conjecture about Line 4 and Line 5. Does your conjecture hold? Does your\nconjecture hold for Line 6 too?\n3.Let us look at the triangular numbers (see Fig.A1.2) again. Add two consecutive\ntriangular numbers. For example, T1 + T2 = 4, T2 + T3 = 9, T3+ T4 = 16.\nWhat about T4 + T5 ?  Make a conjecture about Tn–1 +Tn.\n4.Look at the following pattern:\n12 = 1\n112 = 121\n1112 = 12321\n11112 = 1234321\n111112 = 123454321\nMake a conjecture about each of the following:\n1111112 =\n11111112 =\nCheck if your conjecture is true.\n5.List five axioms (postulates) used in this book.\nA1.5 What is a Mathematical Proof?\nLet us now look at various aspects of proofs. We start with understanding the dif ference\nbetween verification and proof. Before you studied proofs in mathematics, you were\nmainly asked to verify statements.\nFor example, you might have been asked to verify with examples that “the product\nof two even numbers is even”. So you might have picked up two random even numbers,\nReprint 2025-26\n\n180 MATHEMA TICS\nsay 24 and 2006, and checked that 24 × 2006 = 48144 is even. You might have done so\nfor many more examples.\nAlso, you might have been asked as an activity to draw several triangles in the\nclass and compute the sum of their interior angles. Apart from errors due to\nmeasurement, you would have found that the interior angles of a triangle add up to\n180°.\nWhat is the flaw in this method? There are several problems with the process of\nverification.  While it may help you to make a statement you believe is true, you cannot\nbe sure that it is true in all cases. For example, the multiplication of several pairs of\neven numbers may lead us to guess that the product of two even numbers is even.\nHowever , it does not ensure that the product of all pairs of even numbers is even. You\ncannot physically check the products of all possible pairs of even numbers. If you did,\nthen like the girl in the cartoon, you will be calculating the products of even numbers\nfor the rest of your life. Similarly , there may be some triangles which you have not yet\ndrawn whose interior angles do not add up to 180°. W e cannot measure the interior\nangles of all possible triangles.\n, evenAt age 8 At age 16\nAt age 36 At age 86, even , even\n, even\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPROOFS  IN MATHEMA TICS 181\nMoreover , verification can often be misleading. For example, we might be tempted\nto conclude from Pascal’ s triangle (Q.2 of Exercise A1.3), based on earlier verifications,\nthat 1 15 = 15101051. But in fact 1 15 =161051.\nSo, you need another approach that does not depend upon verification for some\ncases only . There is another approach, namely ‘proving a statement’.  A process\nwhich can establish the truth of a mathematical statement based purely on logical\narguments is called a mathematical pr oof.\nIn Example 2 of Section A1.2, you saw that to establish that a mathematical\nstatement is false, it is enough to produce a single counter-example. So while it is not\nenough to establish the validity of a mathematical statement by checking or verifying\nit for thousands of cases, it is enough to produce one counter -example to dispr ove a\nstatement (i.e., to show that something is false). This point is worth emphasising.\nTo show that a mathematical statement is false, it is enough to find a single\ncounter-example.\nSo, 7 + 5 = 12 is a counter-example to the statement that the sum of two odd\nnumbers is odd.\nLet us now look at the list of basic ingredients in a proof:\n(i)To prove a theorem, we should have a rough idea as to how to proceed.\n(ii)The information already given to us in a theorem (i.e., the hypothesis) has to\nbe clearly understood and used.\nGirls don’t\nclimb trees.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n182 MATHEMA TICS\nFor example, in Theorem A1.2, which states that the product of two even\nnumbers is even, we are given two even natural numbers. So, we should use\ntheir properties. In the Factor Theorem (in Chapter 2), you are given a\npolynomial p(x) and are told that p(a) = 0. You have to use this to show that\n(x – a) is a factor of p(x). Similarly , for the converse of the Factor Theorem,\nyou are given that ( x – a) is a factor of p(x), and you have to use this hypothesis\nto prove that p(a) =0.\nYou can also use constructions during the process of proving a theorem.\nFor example, to prove that the sum of the angles of a triangle is 180°, we\ndraw a line parallel to one of the sides through the vertex opposite to the side,\nand use properties of parallel lines.\n(iii)A proof is made up of a successive sequence of mathematical statements.\nEach statement in a proof is logically deduced from a previous statement in\nthe proof, or from a theorem proved earlier , or an axiom, or our hypothesis.\n(iv)The conclusion of a sequence of mathematically true statements laid out in a\nlogically correct order should be what we wanted to prove, that is, what the\ntheorem claims.\nTo understand these ingredients, we will analyse Theorem A1.1 and its proof. You\nhave already studied this theorem in ",

      "content": "Chapter 6. But first, a few comments on proofs in\ngeometry . We often resort to diagrams to help us prove theorems, and this is very\nimportant. However , each statement in the proof has to be established using only\nlogic . Very often, we hear students make statements like “Those two angles are\nequal because in the drawing they look equal” or “that angle must be 900, because the\ntwo lines look as if they are perpendicular to each other”. Beware of being deceived\nby what you see (remember Fig A1.3)! .\nSo now let us go to Theorem A1.1.\nTheor em A1.1 :  The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180°.\nProof :  Consider a triangle ABC (see Fig. A1.4).\nWe have to prove that ∠ ABC + ∠ BCA  + ∠ CAB = 180° (1)\nFig A 1.4\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPROOFS  IN MATHEMA TICS 183\nConstruct a line DE parallel to BC passing through A. (2)\nDE is parallel to BC and AB is a transversal.\nSo, ∠ DAB and ∠ ABC are alternate angles. Therefore, by Theorem 6.2, Chapter 6,\nthey are equal, i.e. ∠ DAB = ∠ ABC (3)\nSimilarly , ∠ CAE = ∠ ACB (4)\nTherefore,  ∠ ABC + ∠ BAC+ ∠ ACB = ∠ DAB +∠ BAC + ∠ CAE (5)\nBut  ∠ DAB +∠ BAC + ∠ CAE = 180°, since they form a straight angle. (6)\nHence,  ∠ ABC + ∠ BAC+ ∠ ACB = 180°. (7)\nNow , we comment on each step of the proof.\nStep 1 :  Our theorem is concerned with a property of triangles, so we begin with a\ntriangle.\nStep 2 :  This is the key idea – the intuitive leap or understanding of how to proceed so\nas to be able to prove the theorem. Very often geometric proofs require a construction.\nSteps 3 and 4 :  Here we conclude that ∠ DAE = ∠ ABC and ∠ CAE = ∠ ACB, by\nusing the fact that DE is parallel to BC (our construction), and the previously proved\nTheorem 6.2, which states that if two parallel lines are intersected by a transversal,\nthen the alternate angles are equal.\nStep 5 :  Here we use Euclid’ s axiom (see Chapter 5) which states that: “If equals are\nadded to equals, the wholes are equal” to deduce\n∠ ABC + ∠ BAC+ ∠ ACB = ∠ DAB +∠ BAC + ∠ CAE.\nThat is, the sum of the interior angles of the triangle are equal to the sum of the angles\non a straight line.\nStep 6 :  Here we use the Linear pair axiom of Chapter 6, which states that the angles\non a straight line add up to 180°, to show that ∠ DAB +∠ BAC + ∠ CAE = 180°.\nStep 7 :  We use Euclid’ s axiom which states that “things which are equal to the same\nthing are equal to each other” to conclude that ∠ ABC + ∠ BAC +\n∠ ACB = ∠ DAB +∠ BAC + ∠ CAE = 180°. Notice that Step 7 is the claim made in\nthe theorem we set out to prove.\nWe now prove Theorems A1.2 and A1.3 without analysing them.\nTheor em A1.2 :  The pr oduct of two even natural numbers is even.\nProof :   Let x and y be any two even natural numbers.\nWe want to prove that xy is even.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n184 MATHEMA TICS\nSince x and y are even, they are divisible by 2 and can be expressed in the form\nx = 2m, for some natural number m and  y = 2n, for some natural number n.\nThen xy = 4 mn. Since 4 mn is divisible by 2, so is xy.\nTherefore, xy is even.\nTheor em A1.3 :  The pr oduct of any thr ee consecutive even natural numbers is\ndivisible by 16.\nProof :  Any three consecutive even numbers will be of the form 2 n, 2n + 2 and\n2n + 4, for some natural number n. We need to prove that their product\n2n(2n + 2)(2 n + 4) is divisible by 16.\nNow , 2n(2n + 2)(2 n + 4) = 2 n × 2( n \n+1) × 2( n + 2)\n= 2 × 2 × 2 n(n + 1)( n + 2) = 8 n(n + 1)( n + 2).\nNow  we have two cases. Either n is even or odd.  Let us examine each case.\nSuppose n is even : Then we can write n = 2m, for some natural number m.\nAnd, then 2 n(2n + 2)(2 n + 4) = 8 n(n + 1)( n + 2) = 16 m(2m + 1)(2 m + 2).\nTherefore, 2 n(2n + 2)(2 n + 4) is divisible by 16.\nNext, suppose n is odd. Then n + 1 is even and we can write n + 1  = 2 r, for some\nnatural number r.\nWe then have : 2n(2n + 2)(2 n + 4) = 8n(n + 1)( n + 2)\n=8(2r – 1) × 2 r × (2 r + 1)\n=16r(2r – 1)(2 r + 1)\nTherefore, 2 n(2n + 2)(2 n + 4) is divisible by 16.\nSo, in both cases we have shown that the product of any three consecutive even\nnumbers is divisible by 16.\nWe conclude this chapter with a few remarks on the dif ference between how\nmathematicians discover results and how formal rigorous proofs are written down. As\nmentioned above, each proof has a key intuitive idea (sometimes more than one).\nIntuition is central to a mathematician’ s way of thinking and discovering results. Very\noften the proof of a theorem comes to a mathematician all jumbled up. A mathematician\nwill often experiment with several routes of thought, and logic, and examples, before\nshe/he can hit upon the correct solution or proof. It is only after the creative phase\nsubsides that all the arguments are gathered together to form a proper proof.\nIt is worth mentioning here that the great Indian mathematician Srinivasa\nRamanujan used very high levels of intuition to arrive at many of his statements, which\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPROOFS  IN MATHEMA TICS 185\nhe claimed were true. Many of these have turned\nout be true and are well known theorems. However ,\neven to this day mathematicians all over the world\nare struggling to prove  (or disprove) some of his claims\n(conjectures).\nEXERCISE A1.4\n1.Find counter-examples to disprove the following statements:\n(i)If the corresponding angles in two triangles are equal, then the triangles are\ncongruent.\n(ii)A quadrilateral with all sides equal is a square.\n(iii)A quadrilateral with all angles equal is a square.\n(iv)For integers a and b, a b2 2+  = a + b\n(v)2n2 + 11 is a prime for all whole numbers n.\n(vi) n2 – n + 41 is a prime for all positive integers n.\n2.Take your favourite proof and analyse it step-by-step along the lines discussed in\nSection A1.5 (what is given, what has been proved, what theorems and axioms have\nbeen used, and so on).\n3.Prove that the sum of two odd numbers is even.\n4.Prove that the product of two odd numbers is odd.\n5.Prove that the sum of three consecutive even numbers is divisible by 6.\n6.Prove that infinitely many points lie on the line whose equation is y = 2x.\n(Hint : Consider the point ( n, 2n) for any integer n.)\n7.You must have had a friend who must have told you to think of a number and do\nvarious things to it, and then without knowing your original number , telling you what\nnumber you ended up with.
