      "content": "2. Here, 3 and 2 are natural numbers.\nSimilarly , the ratio of two integers p and q (q ≠ 0), i.e., p:q can be written in the form\np\nq. This is the form in which rational numbers are expressed.\nA rational number is defined as a number that can be expr essed in the\nform p\nq, wher e p and q ar e integers and q ≠  0.\nThus, 4\n5 is a rational number . Here, p = 4 and q = 5.\nIs 3\n4− also a rational number? Yes, because p = – 3 and q = 4 are integers.\n/circle6You have seen many fractions like 3\n84\n812\n3, ,  etc. All fractions are rational\nnumbers. Can you say why?\nHow about the decimal numbers like 0.5, 2.3, etc.? Each of such numbers can be\nwritten as an ordinary fraction and, hence, are rational numbers. For example, 0.5 = 5\n10,\n0.333 = 333\n1000 etc.\n1.Is the number 2\n3− rational? Think about it. 2.List ten rational numbers.\nNumerator and Denominator\nIn p\nq, the integer p is the numerator , and the integer q (≠ 0) is the denominator .\nThus, in 3\n7−, the numerator is –3 and the denominator is 7.\nMention five rational numbers each of whose\n(a)Numerator is a negative integer and denominator is a positive integer .\n(b)Numerator is a positive integer and denominator is a negative integer .\n(c)Numerator and denominator both are negative integers.\n(d)Numerator and denominator both are positive integers.\n/circle6Are integers also rational numbers?\nAny integer can be thought of as a rational number . For example, the integer –5 is a\nrational number , because you can write it as 5\n1−. The integer 0 can also be written as\n00\n20\n7=or etc. Hence, it is also a rational number .\nThus, rational numbers include integers and fractions.\nTRY THESE\n2024-25\n\nMATHEMA TICS 126\nEquivalent rational numbers\nA rational number can be written with different numerators and denominators. For example,\nconsider the rational number – 2\n3.\n– 2\n3 =–2 2 – 4\n3 2 6×=×. We see that – 2\n3 is the same as – 4\n6.\nAlso,–2\n3 =()()\n( )–2 –5 10\n3 –5 –15×=×. So, – 2\n3 is also the same as 10\n15−.\nThus, – 2\n3 = 4\n6−\n =10\n15−. Such rational numbers that are equal to each other are said to\nbe equivalent to each other .\nAgain,10\n15− =−10\n15 (How?)\nBy multiplying the numerator and denominator of a rational\nnumber by the same non zer o integer , we obtain another rational\nnumber equivalent to the given rational number . This is exactly like\nobtaining equivalent fractions.\nJust as multiplication, the division of the numerator and denominator\nby the same non zero integer , also gives equivalent rational numbers. For\nexample,\n10\n–15 = ()\n( )10 –5 –2\n–15 –5 3÷=÷,     –12\n24 = 12 12 1\n24 12 2− ÷ −=÷\nWe write –2\n3as –2\n3, –10\n15as –10\n15, etc.\n8.4  P OSITIVE  AND NEGATIVE  RATIONAL  NUMBERS\nConsider the rational number 2\n",

It is marked at a point which is half the\ndistance between 0 and 1. So, −1\n2 would be marked at a point half the distance between\n0 and –1.\nWe know how to mark 3\n2 on the number line. It is marked on the right of 0 and lies\nhalfway between 1 and 2. Let us now mark 3\n2− on the number line. It lies on the left of 0\nand is at the same distance as 3\n2 from 0.\nIn decreasing order , we have, 1 2, ( 1)2 2− −= − , 3 4, ( 2)2 2− −= − . This shows that\n3\n2− lies between – 1 and – 2.

The integer – 2 is on\nthe right of – 5 on the number line and  – 2 > – 5.\nShe used this method for rational numbers also. She knew how to mark rational numbers\non the number line. She marked −1\n2 and −1\n5 as follows:\nHas she correctly marked the two points? How and why did she convert −1\n2 to −5\n10\nand −1\n5 to −2\n10? She found that −1\n5 is to the right of −1\n2.

You know that a ratio like 3:2 can also be\nwritten as 3\n2. Here, 3 and 2 are natural numbers.\nSimilarly , the ratio of two integers p and q (q ≠ 0), i.e., p:q can be written in the form\np\nq. This is the form in which rational numbers are expressed.\nA rational number is defined as a number that can be expr essed in the\nform p\nq, wher e p and q ar e integers and q ≠  0.\nThus, 4\n5 is a rational number . Here, p = 4 and q = 5.\nIs 3\n4− also a rational number? Yes, because p = – 3 and q = 4 are integers.\n/circle6You have seen many fractions like 3\n84\n812\n3, ,  etc. All fractions are rational\nnumbers. Can you say why?\nHow about the decimal numbers like 0.5, 2.3, etc.? Each of such numbers can be\nwritten as an ordinary fraction and, hence, are rational numbers. For example, 0.5 = 5\n10,\n0.333 = 333\n1000 etc.\n1.Is the number 2\n3− rational? Think about it. 2.List ten rational numbers.\nNumerator and Denominator\nIn p\nq, the integer p is the numerator , and the integer q (≠ 0) is the denominator .\nThus, in 3\n7−, the numerator is –3 and the denominator is 7.\nMention five rational numbers each of whose\n(a)Numerator is a negative integer and denominator is a positive integer .\n(b)Numerator is a positive integer and denominator is a negative integer .\n(c)Numerator and denominator both are negative integers.\n(d)Numerator and denominator both are positive integers.\n/circle6Are integers also rational numbers?\nAny integer can be thought of as a rational number . For example, the integer –5 is a\nrational number , because you can write it as 5\n1−. The integer 0 can also be written as\n00\n20\n7=or etc. Hence, it is also a rational number .\nThus, rational numbers include integers and fractions.\nTRY THESE\n2024-25\n\nMATHEMA TICS 126\nEquivalent rational numbers\nA rational number can be written with different numerators and denominators. For example,\nconsider the rational number – 2\n3.\n– 2\n3 =–2 2 – 4\n3 2 6×=×. We see that – 2\n3 is the same as – 4\n6.\nAlso,–2\n3 =()()\n( )–2 –5 10\n3 –5 –15×=×. So, – 2\n3 is also the same as 10\n15−.\nThus, – 2\n3 = 4\n6−\n =10\n15−. Such rational numbers that are equal to each other are said to\nbe equivalent to each other .\nAgain,10\n15− =−10\n15 (How?)\nBy multiplying the numerator and denominator of a rational\nnumber by the same non zer o integer , we obtain another rational\nnumber equivalent to the given rational number . This is exactly like\nobtaining equivalent fractions.\nJust as multiplication, the division of the numerator and denominator\nby the same non zero integer , also gives equivalent rational numbers. For\nexample,\n10\n–15 = ()\n( )10 –5 –2\n–15 –5 3÷=÷,     –12\n24 = 12 12 1\n24 12 2− ÷ −=÷\nWe write –2\n3as –2\n3, –10\n15as –10\n15, etc.\n8.4  P OSITIVE  AND NEGATIVE  RATIONAL  NUMBERS\nConsider the rational number 2\n3. Both the numerator and denominator of this number are\npositive integers. Such a rational number is called a positive rational number . So, 3\n85\n72\n9, ,\netc. are positive rational numbers.\nThe numerator of –3\n5 is a negative integer , whereas the denominator\nis a positive integer . Such a rational number is called a negative rational\nnumber . So, 5 3 9, ,7 8 5− − − etc. are negative rational numbers.\nTRY THESE\nFill in the boxes:\n(i)5 25 15\n4 16−= = =\n(ii)3 9 6\n7 14− −= = =\nTRY THESE\n1.Is 5 a positive rational\nnumber?\n2.List five more positive\nrational numbers.\n2024-25\n\nRATIONAL NUMBERS 127\n/circle6 Is 8\n3− a negative rational number? W e know that 8\n3− = 8× 1\n3× 1−\n− −= 8\n3−,  and\n8\n3− is a negative rational number . So, 8\n3− is a negative rational number .\nSimilarly , 5 6 2, ,7 5 9− − − etc. are all negative rational numbers. Note that\ntheir numerators are positive and their denominators negative.\n/circle6 The number 0 is neither a positive nor a negative rational number .\n/circle6 What about 3\n5−\n−?\nYou will see that ()\n( )3 1 3 3\n5 5 1 5− × − −= =− − × −.

The points\nto the left of 0 are denoted by – sign and are negative integers.\nRepresentation of fractions on a number line is also known to you.\nLet us see how the rational numbers can be represented on a number line.\nLet us represent the number −1\n2 on the number line.\nAs done in the case of positive integers, the positive rational numbers would be marked\non the right of 0 and the negative rational numbers would be marked on the left of 0.\nTo which side of 0 will you mark −1\n2? Being a negative rational number , it would be\nmarked to the left of 0.\nYou know that while marking integers on the number line, successive integers are\nmarked at equal intervels. Also, from 0, the pair 1 and –1 is equidistant. So are the pairs 2\nand –2, 3 and –3.TRY THESE\n1.Is – 8 a negative\nrational number?\n2.List five more\nnegative rational\nnumbers.\nTRY THESE\n2024-25\n\nMATHEMA TICS 128\nIn the same way , the rational numbers 1\n2 and −1\n2 would be at equal distance from 0.\nWe know how to mark the rational number 1\n2. It is marked at a point which is half the\ndistance between 0 and 1. So, −1\n2 would be marked at a point half the distance between\n0 and –1.\nWe know how to mark 3\n2 on the number line. It is marked on the right of 0 and lies\nhalfway between 1 and 2. Let us now mark 3\n2− on the number line. It lies on the left of 0\nand is at the same distance as 3\n2 from 0.\nIn decreasing order , we have, 1 2, ( 1)2 2− −= − , 3 4, ( 2)2 2− −= − . This shows that\n3\n2− lies between – 1 and – 2. Thus, 3\n2− lies halfway between – 1 and – 2.\nMark −5\n2 and −7\n2 in a similar way .\nSimilarly , −1\n3 is to the left of zero and at the same distance from zero as 1\n3 is to the\nright. So as done above, −1\n3 can be represented on the number line. Once we know how\nto represent −1\n3 on the number line, we can go on representing 2 4 5, ,3 3 3− − −  and so on.\nAll other rational numbers with dif ferent denominators can be represented in a similar way .\n8.6  R ATIONAL  NUMBERS  IN STANDARD  FORM\nObserve the rational numbers 3\n55\n82\n77\n11, , ,− −.\nThe denominators of these rational numbers are positive integers and 1 is\nthe only common factor between the numerators and denominators. Further ,\nthe negative sign occurs only in the numerator .\nSuch rational numbers are said to be in standard form .\n−3\n2−1\n20\n20=( )1\n22\n21=( )3\n24\n22=( ) ( )212−= − ( )422−= −\n2024-25\n\nRATIONAL NUMBERS 129\nA rational number is said to be in the standar d form if its denominator is a\npositive integer and the numerator and denominator have no common factor other\nthan 1.\nIf a rational number is not in the standard form, then it can be reduced to the\nstandard form.\nRecall that for reducing fractions to their lowest forms, we divided the numerator and\nthe denominator of the fraction by the same non zero positive integer . We shall use the\nsame method for reducing rational numbers to their standard form.\nEXAMPLE  1Reduce 45\n30−\n to the standard form.\nSOLUTION We have,  45 45 3 15 15 5 3\n30 30 3 10 10 5 2− − ÷ − − ÷ −= = = =÷ ÷\nWe had to divide twice. First time by 3 and then by 5. This could also be done as\n45 45 15 3\n30 30 15 2− − ÷ −= =÷\nIn this example, note that 15 is the HCF of 45 and 30.\nThus, to r educe the rational number to its standar d form, we divide its numerator\nand denominator by their HCF ignoring the negative sign, if any . (The r eason for\nignoring the negative sign will be studied in Higher Classes)\nIf there is negative sign in the denominator , divide by ‘– HCF’.\nEXAMPLE  2Reduce to standard form:\n(i)36\n24−(ii)3\n15−\n−\nSOLUTION\n(i)The HCF of 36 and 24 is 12.\nThus, its standard form would be obtained by dividing by –12.\n()\n( )36 12 36 3\n24 24 12 2÷ − −= =− − ÷ −\n(ii)The HCF of 3 and 15 is 3.\nThus, ()\n( )3 2 3 1\n15 15 3 5− ÷ − −= =− − ÷ −\nTRY THESE\nFind the standard form of (i)18\n45−(ii)12\n18−\n2024-25\n\nMATHEMA TICS 130\n8.7  C OMPARISON  OF RATIONAL  NUMBERS\nWe know how to compare two integers or two fractions and tell which is smaller or which\nis greater among them. Let us now see how we can compare two rational numbers.\n/circle6Two positive rational numbers, like 2\n35\n7and  can be compared as studied earlier in the\ncase of fractions.\n/circle6Mary compared two negative rational numbers −1\n2 and −1\n5 using number line. She\nknew that the integer which was on the right side of the other integer , was the greater\ninteger .\nFor example, 5 is to the right of 2 on the number line and 5 > 2. The integer – 2 is on\nthe right of – 5 on the number line and  – 2 > – 5.\nShe used this method for rational numbers also. She knew how to mark rational numbers\non the number line. She marked −1\n2 and −1\n5 as follows:\nHas she correctly marked the two points? How and why did she convert −1\n2 to −5\n10\nand −1\n5 to −2\n10? She found that −1\n5 is to the right of −1\n2. Thus, −1\n5>−1\n2 or −1\n2<−1\n5.\nCan you compare −3\n4 and −2\n3? −1\n3 and −1\n5?\nWe know from our study of fractions that 1\n5<1\n2. And what did Mary get for −1\n2 and\n−1\n5? Was it not exactly the opposite?\nYou will find that, 1\n2>1\n5 but −1\n2<−1\n5.\nDo you observe the same for −3\n4, −2\n3 and 1\n3−, −1\n5?\nMary remembered that in integers she had studied  4 > 3\nbut – 4 < –3, 5 > 2 but –5 < –2 etc.−=−1\n25\n10−=−1\n52\n10–1 0 1\n2024-25\n\nRATIONAL NUMBERS 131\n/circle6The case of pairs of negative rational numbers is similar . To compar e two negative\nrational numbers, we compar e them ignoring their negative signs and then r everse\nthe or der.\nFor example, to compare −7\n5 and −5\n3, we first compare 7\n5 and 5\n3.\nWe get 7\n5 < 5\n3 and conclude that –7 –5>5 3.\nTake five more such pairs and compare them.\nWhich is greater −3\n8 or −2\n7?; −4\n3 or −3\n2?\n/circle6Comparison of a negative and a positive rational number is obvious. A negative rational\nnumber is to the left of zero whereas a positive rational number is to the right of zero on\na number line. So, a negative rational number will always be less than a positive rational\nnumber .\nThus, 2 1\n7 2− < .\n/circle6To compare rational numbers 3 2and5 7− −\n− − reduce them to their standard forms and\nthen compare them.\nEXAMPLE  3Do 4\n9− and −16\n36 represent the same rational number?\nSOLUTION Yes, because ()\n( )4 4 4 16\n9 9 4 36× − −= =− × − or 16 16 4 4\n36 35 4 9− − + − −= =÷ − −.\n8.8RATIONAL  NUMBERS  BETWEEN  TWO RATIONAL  NUMBERS\nReshma wanted to count the whole numbers between 3 and 10. From her earlier classes,\nshe knew there would be exactly 6 whole numbers between 3 and 10. Similarly , she\nwanted to know the total number of integers between –3 and 3. The integers between –3\nand 3 are –2, –1, 0, 1, 2. Thus, there are exactly 5 integers between –3 and 3.\nAre there any integers between –3 and –2? No, there is no integer between\n–3 and – 2. Between two successive integers the number of integers is 0.\n2024-25\n\nMATHEMA TICS 132\nThus, we find that number of integers between two integers are limited (finite).\nWill the same happen in the case of rational numbers also?\nReshma took two rational numbers 3\n5− and 1\n3−.\nShe converted them to rational numbers with same denominators.\nSo       3 9\n5 15− −=  and 1 5\n3 15− −=\nWe have        9 8 7 6 5\n15 15 15 15 15− − − − −< < < <  or 3 8 7 6 1\n5 15 15 15 3− − − − −< < < <\nShe could find rational numbers 8 7 6\n15 15 15− − −< <  between − −3\n51\n3and .\nAre the numbers− − −8\n157\n156\n15, ,  the only rational numbers between − −3\n51\n3and ?\nWe have3 18\n5 30− −<  and 8 16\n15 30− −<\nAnd18 17 16\n30 30 30− − −< < .i.e., 3 17 8\n5 30 15− − −< <\nHence3 17 8 7 6 1\n5 30 15 15 15 3− − − − − −< < < < <\nSo, we could find one more rational number between 3\n5− and 1\n3−.\nBy using this method, you can insert as many rational numbers as you want between\ntwo different rational numbers.\nFor example,3 3 30 90\n5 5 30 150− − × −= =× and 1 1 50 50\n3 3 50 150− − × −= =×\nWe get 39 rational numbers − −\n\n89\n15051\n150,...,  between 90\n150−\n and50\n150−\ni.e., between 3\n5− and 1\n3−.

The numbers 2 3, ,37 8− etc. are rational numbers.\n2.All integers and fractions are rational numbers.\n3.If the numerator and denominator of a rational number are multiplied or divided by a\nnon-zero integer, we get a rational number which is said to be equivalent to the given\nrational number . For example 3 3 2 6\n7 7 2 14− − × −= =×. So, we say 6\n14− is the equivalent\nform of 3\n7−. Also note that 6 6 2 3\n14 14 2 7− − ÷ −= =÷.\n4.Rational numbers are classified as Positive and Negative rational numbers. When the\nnumerator and denominator , both, are positive integers, it is a positive rational number .\nWhen either the numerator or the denominator is a negative integer , it is a negative\nrational number . For example, 3\n8 is a positive rational number whereas 8\n9− is a\nnegative rational number .\n5.The number 0 is neither a positive nor a negative rational number .\n6.A rational number is said to be in the standard form if its denominator is a positive\ninteger and the numerator and denominator have no common factor other than 1.\nThe numbers 1 2,3 7− etc. are in standard form.\n7.There are unlimited number of rational numbers between two rational numbers.\n8.Two rational numbers with the same denominator can be added by adding their\nnumerators, keeping the denominator same. Two rational numbers with dif ferent\ndenominators are added by first taking the LCM of the two denominators and\nthen converting both the rational numbers to their equivalent forms having the\nLCM as the denominator . For example , 2 3 16 9 16 9 7\n3 8 24 24 24 24− − − + −+ = + = = . Here ,\nLCM of 3 and 8 is 24.\n9.While subtracting two rational numbers, we add the additive inverse of the rational\nnumber to be subtracted to the other rational number .\nThus, 7 2 7 2additive inverse of8 3 8 3− = + = 7 ( 2) 21 ( 16) 5\n8 3 24 24− + −+ = = .\n2024-25\n\nRATIONAL NUMBERS 143\n10. To multiply two rational numbers, we multiply their numerators and denominators\nseparately , and write the product as productof numerators.\nproduct of denominators\n11.To divide one rational number by the other non-zero rational number , we multiply the\nrational number by the reciprocal of the other . Thus,\n7 4 7\n2 3 2− −÷ =  × (reciprocal of 4\n3) 7 3 21×2 4 8− −= = .\n2024-25\n\n",
