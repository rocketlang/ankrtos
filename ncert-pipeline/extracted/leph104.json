      "content": "Chapter 1 about\nthe electric field E. We have seen that the interaction\nbetween two charges can be considered in two stages.\nThe charge Q, the source of the field, produces an electric\nfield E, whereFIGURE  4.1 The magnetic field due to a straight long current-carrying\nwire. The wir e is perpendicular to the plane of the paper . A ring of\ncompass needles surrounds the wire. The orientation of the needles is\nshown when (a) the curr ent emer ges out of the plane of the paper ,\n(b) the curr ent moves into the plane of the paper . (c) The arrangement of\niron filings around the wire. The darkened ends of the needle represent\nnorth poles. The effect of the earth’s magnetic field is neglected.\n*A dot appears like the tip of an arrow pointed at you, a cross is like the feathered\ntail of an arrow moving away from you.Hans Christian Oersted\n(1777–1851)  Danish\nphysicist and chemist,\nprofessor at Copenhagen.\nHe observed that a\ncompass needle suffers a\ndeflection when placed\nnear a wire carrying an\nelectric current. This\ndiscovery gave the first\nempirical evidence of a\nconnection between electric\nand magnetic phenomena.HANS CHRISTIAN OERSTED  (1777– 1851)\nReprint 2025-26\n\n109Moving Charges and\nMagnetism\nE = Q ˆr/ (4pe0)r2(4.1)\nwhere ˆr is unit vector along r,  and  the field E is a vector\nfield. A charge q interacts with this field and experiences\na force F given by\nF  =  q  E   = q Q ˆr  / (4pe0) r2(4.2)\nAs pointed out in the Chapter 1, the field E is not just\nan artefact but has a physical role. It can  convey  energy\nand momentum and is not established instantaneously\nbut takes finite time to propagate. The concept of a field\nwas specially stressed by Faraday  and was incorporated\nby Maxwell in his unification of electricity and magnetism.\nIn addition to depending on each point in space, it can\nalso vary with time, i.e., be a function of time.  In our\ndiscussions in this chapter , we will assume that the fields\ndo not change with time.\nThe field at a particular point can be due to one or\nmore charges. If there are more charges the fields add\nvectorially. Y ou have alr eady lear nt in Chapter 1 that this\nis called the principle of superposition. Once the field is\nknown, the force on a test charge is given by Eq. (4.2).\nJust as static charges produce an electric field, the\ncurrents or moving charges produce (in addition) a\nmagnetic field, denoted by B (r), again a vector field. It\nhas several basic properties identical to the electric field.\nIt is defined at each point in space (and can in addition\ndepend on time). Experimentally, it is found to obey the\nprinciple of superposition: the magnetic field of several\nsources is the vector addition of magnetic field of each\nindividual source .\n4.2.2  Magnetic Field,  Lorentz  Force\nLet us suppose that there is  a point charge q (moving\nwith a velocity v and, located at r at a given time t) in\npresence of both the electric field E (r) and the magnetic\nfield B (r).  The force on an electric charge q due to both\nof them can be written as\nF   = q [ E (r) +  v × B (r)] º Felectric +Fmagnetic(4.3)\nThis force was given first  by H.A. Lorentz based on the extensive\nexperiments of Amper e and others. It is called the Lorentz for ce. You\nhave already studied in detail the force due to the electric field. If we\nlook at the interaction with the magnetic field, we find the following\nfeatures.\n(i)It depends on q, v and B (charge of the particle, the velocity and the\nmagnetic field). Force on a negative charge is opposite to that on a\npositive charge.\n(ii)The magnetic force q [ v × B ] includes a vector product of velocity\nand magnetic field. The vector product makes the force due to magneticHENDRIK ANTOON LORENTZ  (1853 – 1928)Hendrik Antoon Lorentz\n(1853  – 1928)  Dutch\ntheoretical physicist,\nprofessor at Leiden.  He\ninvestigated  the\nrelationship between\nelectricity, magnetism,  and\nmechanics. In order to\nexplain the observed effect\nof magnetic fields on\nemitters of light (Zeeman\neffect), he postulated the\nexistence of electric charges\nin the atom, for which he\nwas awarded the Nobel Prize\nin 1902. He derived a set of\ntransformation equations\n(known after him, as\nLorentz transformation\nequations) by some tangled\nmathematical arguments,\nbut he was not aware that\nthese equations hinge on a\nnew concept of space and\ntime.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPhysics\n110field vanish (become zero) if  v elocity and magnetic field are parallel\nor anti-parallel. The force acts in a (sideways) direction perpendicular\nto both the velocity and the magnetic field. Its\ndirection  is given by the screw rule or right hand\nrule  for vector (or cross) product as illustrated\nin Fig. 4.2.\n(iii) The magnetic force is zero if  charge is not\nmoving (as then | v|= 0).  Only a moving\ncharge feels the magnetic force.\nThe expression for the magnetic force helps\nus to define the unit of the magnetic field, if one\ntakes q, F and v, all to be unity in the force\nequation F = q [ v × B ] =q v B sin q ˆn,  where q is\nthe angle between  v and B [see  Fig. 4.2 (a)]. The\nmagnitude of magnetic field B is 1 SI unit, when\nthe force acting on a unit charge (1 C), moving\nperpendicular to B with a speed 1m/s,  is one\nnewton.\nDimensionally, we have [ B] = [ F/qv] and the unit\nof B are Newton second / (coulomb metre).  This unit is called tesla (T)\nnamed after Nikola Tesla (1856 – 1943). Tesla is a rather large unit. A\nsmaller  unit (non-SI) called gauss  (=10–4 tesla) is also often used. The\nearth’s magnetic field is about 3.6 × 1 0–5 T.\n4.2.3  Magnetic force on a current-carrying conductor\nWe can extend the analysis for for ce due to magnetic field on a single\nmoving ch arge to a straight rod carrying current. Consider a rod of a\nunifor m cross-sectional ar ea A and length l. We shall assume one kind\nof mobile carriers as in a conductor (here electrons). Let the number\ndensity of these mobile charge carriers in it be n. Then the total number\nof mobile charge carriers in it is nlA. For a steady current I in this\nconducting rod, we may assume that each mobile carrier has an average\ndrift velocity vd (see ",

      "content": "Chapter\n5) that a force on a particle does work if  the force has a component along\n(or opposed to) the direction of motion of the particle. In the case of motion\nof a charge in a magnetic field, the magnetic force is perpendicular to the\nvelocity of the particle. So no work is done and no change in the magnitude\nof the velocity is produced (though the direction of momentum may be\nchanged). [Notice that this is unlike the force due to an electric field, qE,\nwhich can have a component parallel (or antiparallel) to motion and thus\ncan transfer energy in addition to momentum.]\nWe shall consider motion of a charged particle in a unifor m magnetic\nfield. First consider the case of v perpendicular to  B.  The\nperpendicular force, q v × B , acts as a centripetal force and\nproduces a circular motion perpendicular to the magnetic field.\nThe particle will describe a circle if v and B are  perpendicular\nto each other (Fig. 4.5).\nIf velocity has a component along B, this component\nremains unchanged as the motion along the magnetic field will\nnot be affected by the magnetic field. The motion in a plane\nperpendicular to B is as before a circular one, thereby producing\na helical motion  (Fig. 4.6).\nYou have already learnt in earlier classes (Se e Class XI ,\nChapter 3) that if r is the radius of the circular path of a particle,\nthen a force of  m v2 / r, acts perpendicular to the path towards\nthe centre of the circle, and is called the  centripetal force. If the\nvelocity v is perpendicular to the magnetic field   B, the  magnetic\nforce is  perpendicular to both  v and B and acts like a\ncentripetal force. I t has a magnitude q v B .\nEquating the two expressions for centripetal\nforce,\nm v 2/r = q v B, which gives\nr =  m v / qB (4.5)\nfor the radius of the circle described by the\ncharged particle. The larger the  momentum,  the\nlarger is the radius and bigger the circle\ndescribed. If w is the angular frequency, then   v\n= w  r. So,\nw  = 2p n =  q B/ m [4.6(a)]\nwhich is independent of the velocity or energy .\nHere n is the frequency of rotation. The\nindependence of n from energy has important\napplication in the design of a cyclotron.\nThe time taken for one revolution is T= 2p/\nw  º 1/n.

It is given by the Biot-Savart’s  law.\nFig. 4.7 shows a finite conductor XY carrying current I. Consider\nan infinitesimal element d l of the conductor . The magnetic field\ndB due to this element is to be determined at a point P which is at\na distance r from it. Let q be the angle between d l and the\ndisplacement vector r. According to Biot-Savart’ s law , the\nmagnitude of the magnetic field d B is proportional to the current\nI, the element length |d l|, and inversely proportional to the square\nof the distance r. Its direction * is perpendicular to the plane\ncontaining d l and r . Thus, in vector notation,\ndI d\nrBr∝×l\n3\n           =×µ0\n34πI d\nrlr\n [4.7(a)]\nwhere m0/4p is a constant of proportionality.

The Ä sign\nindicates that the\nfield is perpendicular\nto the plane of this\npage and directed\ninto it.*The sense of  d l×r is also given by the Right Hand Screw rule  : Look at the\nplane containing vectors d l and r. Imagine moving from the first vector towards\nsecond vector .

Some\nof these are:\n(i)Both are long range, since both depend inversely on the square of\ndistance from the source to the point of interest. The principle of\nsuperposition applies to both fields. [In this connection, note that\nthe magnetic field is linear in the source I dl just as the electrostatic\nfield is linear in its source: the electric charge.]\n(ii)The electrostatic field is produced by a scalar source, namely, the electric\ncharge. The magnetic field is produced by a vector source I dl.\n(iii)The electrostatic field is along the displacement vector joining the\nsource and the field point. The magnetic field is perpendicular to the\nplane containing the displacement vector r and the current element I dl.\n(iv)There is an angle dependence in the Biot-Savart law which is not\npresent  in the electrostatic case.

Ampere’s circuital law\nconsiders an open surface with a boundary (Fig. 4.12).\nThe surface has current passing through it. We consider\nthe boundary to be made up of a number of small line\nelements. Consider one such element of length dl. We\ntake the value of the tangential component of the\nmagnetic field, Bt, at this element and multiply it by theFIGURE  4.12 EXAMPLE  4.6\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPhysics\n118length of that element dl [Note: Btdl=B.dl]. All such\nproducts are added together. We consider the limit as the\nlengths of elements get smaller and their number gets\nlarger. The sum then tends to an integral. Ampere’s   law\nstates that this integral is  equal to µ0 times the total\ncurrent passing through  the surface,  i.e.,\n“B.dl = µ0I [4.13(a)]\nwhere I  is the total current through the surface. The\nintegral is taken over the closed loop coinciding with the\nboundary C of the surface. The relation above involves a\nsign-convention, given by the right-hand rule. Let the\nfingers of the right-hand be curled in the sense the\nboundary is traversed in the loop integral “B.dl. Then\nthe direction of the thumb gives the sense in which the\ncurrent I  is regarded as positive.\nFor several applications, a much simplified version of\nEq. [4.13(a)] proves sufficient. We shall assume that, in\nsuch cases, it is possible to choose the loop (called\nan amperian loop ) such that at each point of the\nloop, either\n(i)B is tangential to the loop and is a non-zero constant\nB, or\n(ii)B is normal to the loop, or\n(iii)B vanishes.\nNow, let L be the length (part) of the  loop for which B\nis tangential . Let Ie  be the current enclosed by the loop.\nThen, Eq. (4.13) reduces to,\nBL =µ0Ie[4.13(b)]\nWhen there is a system with a symmetry such as for\na straight infinite current-carrying wire  in Fig. 4.13, the\nAmpere’s law enables an easy evaluation of the magnetic\nfield, much the same way Gauss’ law helps in\ndetermination of the electric field. This is exhibited in the\nExample 4.8 below. The boundary of the loop chosen is\na circle and magnetic field is tangential to the\ncircumference of the circle. The law gives, for the left hand\nside of Eq. [4.13 (b)], B. 2 πr. We find that the magnetic\nfield at a distance r outside the wire is tangential and\ngiven by\nB × 2πr  =  µ0 I,\nB = µ0  I/ (2πr) (4.14)\nThe above result for the infinite wire  is interesting\nfrom several points of view.ANDRE AMPERE  (1775 –1836)Andre Ampere (1775 –\n1836) Andre Marie Ampere\nwas a French physicist,\nmathematician and chemist\nwho founded the science of\nelectrodynamics.

      "content": "12. Ampere grasped the\nsignificance of Oersted’s\ndiscovery. He carried out a\nlarge series of experiments\nto explore the relationship\nbetween current electricity\nand magnetism. These\ninvestigations culminated\nin 1827 with the\npublication of the\n‘Mathematical Theory of\nElectrodynamic Pheno-\nmena Deduced Solely from\nExperiments’. He hypo-\nthesised that all magnetic\nphenomena are due to\ncirculating electric\ncurrents. Ampere was\nhumble and absent-\nminded. He once forgot an\ninvitation to dine with the\nEmperor Napoleon. He died\nof pneumonia at the age of\n61. His gravestone bears\nthe epitaph: Tandem Feli x\n(Happy at last).\n(i) It implies that the field at every point on a circle of\nradius r, (with the wire along the axis), is same in\nmagnitude. In other words, the magnetic field\nReprint 2025-26\n\n119Moving Charges and\nMagnetism EXAMPLE  4.7possesses what is called a cylindrical symmetry . The field that\nnormally can depend on three coordinates depends only on one: r.\nWhenever there is symmetry, the solutions simplify.\n(ii) The field direction at any point on this circle is tangential to it.\nThus, the lines of constant magnitude of magnetic field form\nconcentric circles. Notice now, in Fig. 4.1(c), the iron filings form\nconcentric circles. These lines called magnetic field lines  form closed\nloops. This is unlike the electrostatic field lines which originate\nfrom positive charges and end at negative charges. The expression\nfor the magnetic field of a straight wire provides a theoretical\njustification to Oersted’s experiments.\n(iii) Another interesting point to note is that even though the wire is\ninfinite, the field due to it at a non-zero distance is not infinite. It\ntends to blow up only when we come very close to the wire. The\nfield is directly proportional to the current and inversely\nproportional to the distance from the (infinitely long) current source.\n(iv) There exists a simple rule to determine the direction of the magnetic\nfield due to a long wire. This rule, called the  right-hand rule *, is:\nGrasp the wire in your right hand with your extended thumb pointing\nin the dir ection of the curr ent. Y our fingers will curl ar ound in the\ndirection of the magnetic field.\nAmpere’s circuital law is not new in content from Biot-Savart law.\nBoth relate the magnetic field and the current, and both express the same\nphysical consequences of a steady electrical current. Ampere’s law is to\nBiot-Savart law, what Gauss’s law is to Coulomb’s law. Both, Ampere’s\nand Gauss’s law relate a physical quantity on the periphery or boundary\n(magnetic or electric field) to another physical quantity, namely, the source,\nin the interior (current or charge). We also note that Ampere’s circuital\nlaw holds for steady currents which do not fluctuate with time. The\nfollowing example will help us understand what is meant by the term\nenclosed  current.\nExample 4.7  Figure 4.13 shows a long straight wire of a circular\ncross-section (radius a) carrying steady current I. The current I is\nuniformly distributed across this cross-section. Calculate the\nmagnetic field in the region r < a and r > a.\nFIGURE  4.13\n*Note that there are two distinct  right-hand rules: One which gives the direction\nof B on the axis of current-loop and the other which gives direction of B\nfor a straight conducting wire. Fingers and thumb play different roles in\nthe two.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPhysics\n120\n EXAMPLE  4.7Solution (a) Consider the case r > a. The Amperian loop, labelled 2,\nis a circle concentric with the cross-section. For this loop,\nL  = 2 π r\nIe = Current enclosed by the loop = I\nThe result is the familiar expression for a long straight wire\nB (2π r) = µ0I\nπ 0\n2IBrµ= [4.15(a)]\n1Br∝ (r > a)\nNow the current enclosed Ie is not I, but is less than this value.\nSince the current distribution is uniform, the current enclosed is,\nI Ir\nae=\n\nπ\nπ2\n2 2\n2Ir\na=\nUsing Ampere’s law, π2\n0 2(2 )I rB raµ=\nBI\nar =\n\nµ0\n22π[4.15(b)]\nB ∝ r      (r < a)\nFIGURE  4.14\nFigure (4.14) shows a plot of the magnitude of B with distance r\nfrom the centre of the wire. The direction of the field is tangential to\nthe respective circular loop (1 or 2) and given by the right-hand\nrule described earlier in this section.\nThis example possesses the required symmetry so that Ampere’s\nlaw can be applied readily.\nIt should be noted that while Ampere’s circuital law holds for any\nloop, it may not always facilitate an evaluation of the magnetic field in\nevery case. For example, for the case of the circular loop discussed in\nSection 4.5, it cannot be applied to extract the simple expression\nB = µ0I/2R [Eq. (4.12)] for the field at the centre of the loop. However,\nthere exists a large number of situations of high symmetry where the law\ncan be conveniently applied. We shall use  it in the next section to calculate\nReprint 2025-26\n\n121Moving Charges and\nMagnetism\nthe magnetic field produced by a commonly used and very useful\nmagnetic system: the solenoid .\n4.7  T HE SOLENOID\nWe shall discuss a long solenoid. B y long solenoid we mean that the\nsolenoid’s length is large compared to its radius. It consists of a long wire\nwound in the form of a helix where the neighbouring turns are closely\nspaced. So each turn can be regarded as a circular loop.  The net magnetic\nfield is the vector sum of the fields due to all the turns. Enamelled wires\nare used for winding so that turns are insulated from each other .\nFigure 4.1 5 displays the magnetic field lines for a finite solenoid. We\nshow a section of this solenoid in an enlarged manner  in Fig. 4.1 5(a).\nFigure  4.15(b) show s the entire finite solenoid with its magnetic field. In\nFig. 4.1 5(a), it is clear from the circular loops that the field  between two\nneighbouring turns vanishes. In Fig. 4.1 5(b), we see that the field at the\ninterior mid-point P is uniform, strong and along the axis of the solenoid.\nThe field at the exterior mid-point Q is weak and moreover is along the\naxis of the solenoid with no perpendicular or normal component. As theFIGURE  4.15  (a) The magnetic field due to a section of the solenoid which has been\nstretched out for clarity. Only the exterior semi-circular part is shown. Notice\nhow the circular loops between neighbouring turns tend to cancel.\n(b) The magnetic field of a finite solenoid.\nFIGURE  4.16 The magnetic field of a very long solenoid.

The field outside the solenoid\napproaches zero. We shall assume that the field outside is zero. The field\ninside becomes everywhere parallel to the axis.\nConsider a rectangular Amperian loop abcd. Along cd the field is zero\nas argued above. Along transverse sections bc and ad, the field component\nis zero. Thus, these two sections  make no contribution. Let the field along\nab be B. Thus, the relevant length of the Amperian loop is, L = h.\nLet n be the number of turns per unit length, then the total number\nof turns is  nh. The enclosed current is,  Ie = I (n h), where I is the current\nin the solenoid. From Ampere’s circuital law [Eq. 4.13 (b)]\nBL =  µ0Ie,    B h = µ0I (n h)\nB = µ0 n I (4.16)\nThe direction of the field is given by the right-hand rule. The solenoid\nis commonly used to obtain a uniform magnetic field. We shall see in the\nnext chapter that a large field is possible by inserting a soft iron core\ninside the solenoid.\nExample 4.8  A solenoid of length 0.5 m has a radius of 1 cm and is\nmade up of 500 turns. It carries a current of 5 A. What is the\nmagnitude of the magnetic field inside the solenoid?\nSolution  The number of turns per unit length is,\n50010000.5n= =  turns/m\nThe length l = 0.5 m and radius r = 0.01 m. Thus,  l/a = 50 i.e., l >> a.\nHence, we can use the long solenoid formula, namely, Eq. (4.20)\nB = µ0n I\n   = 4π × 10–7 × 103 × 5\n   = 6.28  × 10–3 T\nFIGURE  4.17 Two long straight\nparallel conductors carrying steady\ncurrents Ia and Ib and separated by a\ndistance d. Ba is the magnetic field\nset up by conductor ‘a’ at conductor ‘b’.4.8 F ORCE BETWEEN  TWO PARALLEL\nCURRENTS , THE AMPERE\nWe have learnt that there exists a magnetic field due to a\nconductor carrying a current which obeys the Biot-Savart\nlaw. Further, we have learnt that an external magnetic field\nwill exert a force on a current-carrying conductor. This\nfollows from the Lorentz force formula. Thus, it is logical\nto expect that two current-carrying conductors placed near\neach other will exert (magnetic) forces on each other. In\nthe period 1820-25, Ampere studied the nature of this\nmagnetic force and its dependence on the magnitude of\nthe current, on the shape and size of the conductors, as\nwell as, the distances between the conductors. In this\nsection, we shall take the simple example of two parallel\ncurrent- carrying conductors, which will perhaps help us\nto appreciate Ampere’s painstaking work.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n123Moving Charges and\nMagnetism\nFigure 4.17 shows two long parallel conductors a and b separated\nby a distance d and carrying (parallel) currents Ia and Ib, respectively.\nThe conductor ‘a’ produces,  the same magnetic field Ba at all points\nalong the conductor ‘b’. The right-hand rule tells us that the direction of\nthis field is downwards (when the conductors are placed horizontally).\nIts magnitude is given by Eq. [4.15(a)] or from Ampere’s circuital law,\n0\n2a\naIBdµ=π\nThe conductor ‘b’ carrying a current Ib will experience a sideways\nforce due to the  field Ba. The direction of this force is towards the\nconductor ‘a’ (Verify this). We label this force as Fba, the force on a\nsegment L of ‘b’ due to ‘a’. The magnitude of this force is given by\nEq. (4.4),\n=ba b aF I LB\n      µ\nπ=0\n2a bI ILd(4.17)\nIt is of course possible to compute the force on ‘a’ due to ‘b’. From\nconsiderations similar to above we can find the force Fab, on a segment of\nlength L of ‘a’ due to the current in ‘b’. It  is equal in magnitude to Fba,\nand directed towards ‘b’. Thus,\nFba = –Fab(4.18)\nNote that this is consistent with Newton’s third Law. Thus, at least for\nparallel conductors and steady currents, we have shown that the\nBiot-Savart law and the Lorentz force yield results in accordance with\nNewton’s third Law *.\nWe have seen from above that currents flowing in the same direction\nattract each other. One can show that oppositely directed currents repel\neach other. Thus,\nParallel currents attract, and antiparallel currents repel.\nThis rule is the opposite of what we find in electrostatics. Like (same\nsign) charges repel each other, but like (parallel) currents attract each other.\nLet fba represent the magnitude of the force Fba per unit length. Then,\nfrom Eq. (4.17),\nπ0\n2a b\nbaI Ifdµ= (4.19)\nThe above expression is used to define the ampere (A), which is one of\nthe seven SI base units.\n*It turns out that when we have time-dependent currents and/or charges in\nmotion, Newton’s third law may not hold for forces between charges and/or\nconductors. An essential consequence of the Newton’s third law in mechanics\nis conservation of momentum of an isolated system. This, however, holds even\nfor the case of time-dependent situations with electromagnetic fields, provided\nthe momentum carried by fields is also taken into account.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPhysics\n124\n EXAMPLE  4.9The ampere  is the value of that steady current which, when maintained\nin each of the two very long, straight, parallel conductors of negligible\ncross-section, and placed one metre apart in vacuum, would produce\non  each of these conductors a force equal to  2 × 10–7 newtons per metre\nof length.\nThis definition of the ampere was adopted in 1946. It is a theoretical\ndefinition. In practice, one must eliminate the effect of the earth’s magnetic\nfield and substitute very long wires by multiturn coils of appropriate\ngeometries. An instrument called the current balance is used to measure\nthis mechanical force.\nThe SI unit of charge, namely, the coulomb, can now be defined in\nterms of the ampere.\nWhen a steady current of 1A is set up in a conductor, the quantity of\ncharge that flows through its cross-section in 1s is one coulomb (1C).\nExample 4.9  The horizontal component of the earth’s magnetic field\nat a certain place is 3.0 ×10–5 T and the direction of the field is from\nthe geographic south to the geographic north. A very long straight\nconductor is carrying a steady current of 1A. What is the force per\nunit length on it when it is placed on a horizontal table and the\ndirection of the current is (a) east to west; (b) south to north?\nSolution   F = Il × B\nF = IlB sinθ\nThe force per unit length is\nf = F/l = I B sinθ\n(a)When the current is flowing from east to west,\nθ = 90°\nHence,\nf = I B\n  = 1 × 3 × 10–5 = 3 × 10–5 N m–1\nThis is larger than the value 2×10–7 Nm–1 quoted in the definition\nof the ampere. Hence it is important to eliminate the effect of the\nearth’s magnetic field and other stray fields while standardising\nthe ampere.\nThe direction of the force is downwards. This direction may be\nobtained by the directional property of cross product of vectors.\n(b)When the current is flowing from south to north,\nθ = 0o\nf = 0\nHence there is no force on the conductor.\n4.9  T ORQUE  ON CURRENT  LOOP, MAGNETIC  DIPOLE\n4.9.1 Torque on a rectangular current loop in a uniform\nmagnetic field\nWe now show that a rectangular loop carrying a steady current I and\nplaced in a uniform magnetic field experiences a torque. It does not\nexperience a net force. This behaviour is analogous to that of electric\ndipole in a uniform electric field (Section 1.11).\nReprint 2025-26\n\n125Moving Charges and\nMagnetism\nWe first consider the simple case when the\nrectangular loop is placed such that the uniform\nmagnetic field B is in the plane of the loop. This is\nillustrated in Fig. 4.18(a).\nThe field exerts no force on the two arms AD and BC\nof the loop. It is perpendicular to the arm AB of the loop\nand exerts a force F1 on it which is directed into the\nplane of the loop. Its magnitude is,\nF1 = I b B\nSimilarly, it exerts a force F2 on the arm CD and F2\nis directed out of the plane of the paper.\nF2 = I b B = F1\nThus, the net force  on the loop is zero . There is a\ntorque on the loop due to the pair of forces F1 and F2.\nFigure 4.18(b) shows a view of the loop from the AD\nend. It shows that the torque on the loop tends to rotate\nit anticlockwise. This torque is (in magnitude),\n1 22 2a aF Fτ= +\n( )2 2a aIbB IbB I ab B= + =\n    = I A B (4.20)\nwhere A = ab is the area of the rectangle.\nWe next consider the case when the plane of the loop,\nis not along the magnetic field, but makes an angle with\nit. We take the angle between the field and the normal to\nthe coil to be angle θ (The previous case corresponds to\nθ = π/2). Figure 4.19 illustrates this general case.\nThe forces on the arms BC and DA are equal, opposite, and act along\nthe axis of the coil, which connects the centres of mass of BC and DA.\nBeing collinear along the axis they cancel each other, resulting in no net\nforce or torque. The forces on arms AB and CD are F1 and F2. They too\nare equal and opposite, with magnitude,\nF1 = F2 = I b B\nBut they are not collinear!  This results in a couple as before. The\ntorque is, however, less than the earlier case when plane of loop was\nalong the magnetic field. This is because the perpendicular distance\nbetween the forces of the couple has decreased. Figure 4.19(b) is a view\nof the arrangement from the AD end and it illustrates these two forces\nconstituting a couple. The magnitude of the torque on the loop is,\n1 2 sin sin2 2a aF Fτ θ θ= +\n= I ab B sin θ\n   = I A B sin θ (4.21)FIGURE  4.18  (a) A rectangular\ncurrent-carrying coil in uniform\nmagnetic field.

(b) The couple\nacting on the coil.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPhysics\n126\n EXAMPLE  4.10As θ à 0, the perpendicular distance between\nthe forces of the couple also approaches zero. This\nmakes the forces collinear and the net force and\ntorque zero. The torques in Eqs. (4.20) and (4.21)\ncan be expressed as vector product of the magnetic\nmoment of the coil and the magnetic field.\nWe define the magnetic moment of the current\nloop as,\nm = I A (4.22)\nwhere the direction of the area vector A is given\nby the right-hand thumb rule and is directed into\nthe plane of the paper in Fig. 4.18. Then as the\nangle between m and B is θ ,  Eqs. (4.20) and (4.21)\ncan be expressed by one expression\n(4.23)\nThis  is analogous to the electrostatic case\n(Electric dipole of dipole moment pe in an electric\nfield E).\nτ=p E×e\nAs is clear from Eq. (4.22), the dimensions of the\nmagnetic moment are [A][L2] and its unit is Am2.\nFrom Eq. (4.23), we see that the torque τ ττ ττ\nvanishes when  m is either parallel or antiparallel\nto the magnetic field B. This indicates a state of\nequilibrium as there is no torque on the coil (this\nalso applies to any object with a magnetic moment\nm). When  m and B are parallel the equilibrium is\na stable one. Any small rotation of the coil\nproduces a torque which brings it back to its original position. When\nthey are antiparallel, the equilibrium is unstable as any rotation produces\na torque which increases with the amount of rotation. The presence of\nthis torque is also the reason why a small magnet or any magnetic dipole\naligns itself with the external magnetic field.\nIf the loop has N closely wound turns, the expression for torque, Eq.\n(4.23), still holds, with\nm = N I A (4.24)\nExample 4.10  A 100 turn closely wound circular coil of radius 10\ncm carries a current of 3.2 A. (a) What is the field at the centre of the\ncoil? (b) What is the magnetic moment of this coil?\nThe coil is placed in a vertical plane and is free to rotate about a\nhorizontal axis which coincides with its diameter. A uniform magnetic\nfield of 2T in the horizontal direction exists such that initially the axis\nof the coil is in the direction of the field. The coil rotates through an\nangle of 90° under the influence of the magnetic field. (c) What are the\nmagnitudes of the torques on the coil in the initial and final position?\n(d) What is the angular speed acquired by the coil when it has rotated\nby 90°?

If the wire is flexible, why does it change to a\ncircular shape?\nSolution\n(a)No, because that would require τ ττ ττ to be in the vertical direction.\nBut τ ττ ττ = I A × B, and since A of the horizontal loop is in the vertical\ndirection, τ would be in the plane of the loop for any B.\n(b)Orientation of stable equilibrium is one where the area vector A\nof the loop is in the direction of external magnetic field. In this\norientation, the magnetic field produced by the loop is in the same\ndirection as external field, both normal to the  plane of the loop,\nthus giving rise to maximum flux of the total field.\n(c)It assumes circular shape with its plane normal to the field to\nmaximise flux, since for a given perimeter, a circle encloses greater\narea than any other shape.\n4.9.2  Circular current loop as a magnetic dipole\nIn this section, we shall consider the elementary magnetic element: the\ncurrent loop. We shall show that the magnetic field (at large distances)\ndue to current in a circular current loop is very similar in behaviour to\nthe electric field of an electric dipole. In Section 4.5, we have evaluated\nthe magnetic field on the axis of a circular loop, of a radius R, carrying a\nsteady current I. The magnitude of this field is [(Eq. (4.11)],\n( )µ=\n+2\n0\n3/22 22I RB\nx R\nand its direction is along the axis and given by the right-hand thumb\nrule (Fig. 4.10). Here,  x is the distance along the axis from the centre of\nthe loop. For  x >> R, we may drop the R2 term in the denominator. Thus,\nµ=2\n0\n32IRBx\nNote that the area of the loop A = πR2. Thus,\nµ=π0\n32IABx\nAs earlier, we define the magnetic moment m to have a magnitude IA,\nm  = I A. Hence,\nBm≃µ0\n32πx\n    πµ=0\n32\n4xm\n[4.25(a)]\nThe expression of Eq. [4.25(a)] is very similar to an expression obtained\nearlier for the electric field of a dipole. The similarity may be seen if we\nsubstitute,\n µ ε→0 01/\nReprint 2025-26\n\n129Moving Charges and\nMagnetism\ne→m p  (electrostatic dipole)\n →B E   (electrostatic field)\nWe then obtain,\n3\n02\n4e\nxε=πpE\nwhich is precisely the field for an electric dipole at a point on its axis.\nconsidered in Chapter 1, Section 1.9 [Eq. (1.20)].\nIt can be shown that the above analogy can be carried further. We\nhad found in Chapter 1 that the electric field on the perpendicular bisector\nof the dipole is given by [See Eq.(1.21)],\nE≃pe\nx403πε\nwhere x is the distance from the dipole. If we replace p à m and 0 01/µ ε→\nin the above expression, we obtain the result for B for a point in the\nplane of the loop at a distance x  from the centre. For  x >>R,\nBm≃µ0\n34πxx R ; >> [4.25(b)]\nThe results given by Eqs. [4.25(a)] and [4.25(b)] become exact for a\npoint magnetic dipole.\nThe results obtained above can be shown to apply to any planar loop:\na planar current loop is equivalent to a magnetic dipole of dipole moment\nm = I A, which is the analogue of electric dipole moment p. Note, however,\na fundamental difference: an electric dipole is built up of two elementary\nunits — the charges (or electric monopoles). In magnetism, a magnetic\ndipole (or a current loop) is the most elementary element. The equivalent\nof electric charges, i.e., magnetic monopoles, are not known to exist.\nWe have shown that a current loop (i) produces a magnetic field (see\nFig. 4 .10) and behaves like a magnetic dipole at large distances, and\n(ii) is subject to torque like a magnetic needle. This led Ampere to suggest\nthat all magnetism is due to circulating currents. This seems to be partly\ntrue and no magnetic monopoles have been seen so far. However,\nelementary particles such as an electron or a proton also carry an intrinsic\nmagnetic moment, not accounted by circulating currents.\n4.10  THE  MOVING  C\nOIL GALVANOMETER\nCurre nts and voltages in circuits have been discussed extensively in\nChapters 3. But how do we measure them? How do we claim that\ncurrent in a circuit is 1.5 A or the voltage drop across a resistor is 1.2 V?\nFigure 4.20 exhibits a very useful instrument for this purpose: the moving\ncoil galvanometer  (MCG). It is a device whose principle can be understood\non the basis of our discussion in Section 4.9.\nThe galvanometer consists of a coil, with many turns, free to rotate\nabout a fixed axis (Fig. 4.20), in a uniform radial magnetic field. There is\na cylindrical soft iron core which not only makes the field radial but also\nincreases the strength of the magnetic field.  When a current flows through\nthe coil, a torque acts on it. This torque is giv en by Eq. (4.20) to be\nτ = NI AB\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPhysics\n130where the symbols have their usual meaning. Since\nthe field is radial by design, we have taken sin θ = 1 in\nthe above expression for the torque. The magnetic\ntorque NIAB tends to rotate the coil. A spring Sp\nprovides a counter torque kφ that balances the\nmagnetic torque NIAB; resulting in a steady angular\ndeflection φ. In equilibrium\nkφ = NI AB\nwhere k is the torsional constant of the spring; i.e. the\nrestoring torque per unit twist. The deflection φ is\nindicated on the scale by a pointer attached to the\nspring. We have\nφ=\n\nNAB\nkI (4.26)\nThe quantity in brackets is a constant for a given\ngalvanometer.\nThe galvanometer can be used in a number of ways.\nIt can be used as a detector to check if a current is\nflowing in the circuit. We have come across this usage\nin the Wheatstone’s bridge arrangement. In this usage\nthe neutral position of the pointer (when no current is\nflowing through the galvanometer) is in the middle of\nthe scale and not at the left end as shown in Fig.4.20.\nDepending on the direction of the current, the pointer’s\ndeflection is either to the right or the left.\nThe galvanometer cannot as such be used as an\nammeter to measure the value of the current in a given circuit. This is for\ntwo reasons: (i) Galvanometer is a very sensitive device, it gives a full-\nscale deflection for a current of the order of µA. (ii) For measuring currents,\nthe galvanometer has to be connected in series, and as it has a large\nresistance, this will change the value of the current in the circuit. To\novercome these difficulties, one attaches a small resistance rs, called shunt\nresistance , in parallel with the galvanometer coil; so that most of the\ncurrent passes through the shunt. The resistance of this arrangement is,\nRG rs / (RG  + rs)   ≃  rs         if    RG >>  rs\nIf rs has small value, in relation to the resistance of the rest of the\ncircuit Rc, the effect of introducing the measuring instrument is also small\nand negligible. This arrangement is schematically shown in Fig. 4.21.\nThe scale of this ammeter is calibrated and then graduated to read off\nthe current value with ease. We define the current sensitivity of the\ngalvanometer as the deflection per unit current . From Eq. (4.26) this\ncurrent sensitivity is,\nNAB\nI kφ= (4.27)\nA convenient way for the manufacturer  to increase the sensitivity is\nto increase the number of turns N. We choose galvanometers having\nsensitivities of value, required by our experiment.FIGURE  4.20  The moving coil\ngalvanometer. Its elements are\ndescribed in the text. Depending on\nthe requirement, this device can be\nused as a current detector or for\nmeasuring the value of the current\n(ammeter) or voltage (voltmeter).\nFIGURE  4.21\nConversion of a\ngalvanometer (G) to\nan ammeter by the\nintroduction of a\nshunt resistance rs of\nvery small value in\nparallel.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n131Moving Charges and\nMagnetism\nThe galvanometer can also be used as a voltmeter to measure the\nvoltage across a given section of the circuit. For this it must be connected\nin parallel  with that section of the circuit. Further, it must draw a very\nsmall current, otherwise the voltage measurement will disturb the original\nset up by an amount which is very large. Usually we like to keep the\ndisturbance due to the measuring device below one per cent.  To ensure\nthis, a large resistance R is connected in series  with the galvanometer.\nThis arrangement is schematically depicted in Fig.4.22. Note that the\nresistance of the voltmeter is now,\nRG + R ≃ R :  large\nThe scale of the voltmeter is calibrated to read off the voltage value\nwith ease. We define the voltage sensitivity as the deflection per unit\nvoltage . From Eq. (4.26),\nφ\nVNAB\nkI\nVNAB\nk R=\n\n =\n\n1(4.28)\nAn interesting point to note is that increasing the current sensitivity\nmay not necessarily increase the voltage sensitivity. Let us take Eq. (4.27)\nwhich provides a measure of current sensitivity. If N → 2N, i.e., we double\nthe number of turns, then\n2I Iφ φ→\nThus, the current sensitivity doubles. However, the resistance of the\ngalvanometer is also likely to double, since it is proportional to the length\nof the wire. In Eq. (4.28), N →2N, and R →2R, thus the voltage sensitivity,\nV Vφ φ→\nremains unchanged. So in general, the modification needed for conversion\nof a galvanometer to an ammeter  will be different from what is needed for\nconverting it into a voltmeter.\nExample 4.12  In the circuit (Fig. 4.23) the current is to be\nmeasured. What is the value of the current if the ammeter shown\n(a) is a galvanometer with a resistance RG = 60.00 Ω; (b) is a\ngalvanometer described in (a) but converted to an ammeter by a\nshunt resistance rs = 0.02 Ω; (c) is an ideal ammeter with zero\nresistance?\nFIGURE  4.23FIGURE  4.22\nConversion of a\ngalvanometer (G) to a\nvoltmeter by the\nintroduction of a\nresistance R of large\nvalue in series.\nEXAMPLE  4.12\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPhysics\n132SUMMARY\n1.The total force on a charge q moving with velocity v in the presence of\nmagnetic and electric fields B and E, respectively is called the Lorentz\nforce . It is given by the expression:\nF = q (v × B  + E)\nThe magnetic force q  (v × B) is normal to v  and work done by it is zero.\n2.A straight conductor of length l and carrying a steady current I\nexperiences a force F in a uniform external magnetic field B,\nF = I l × B\nwhere| l| = l and the direction of l is given by the direction of the\ncurrent.\n3.In a uniform magnetic field B, a charge q executes a circular orbit in\na plane normal to B. Its frequency of uniform circular motion is called\nthe cyclotron frequency  and is given by:\n2cq B\nmν=π\nThis frequency is independent of the particle’s speed and radius. This\nfact is exploited in a machine, the cyclotron, which is used to\naccelerate charged particles.\n4.The Biot-Savart  law asserts that the magnetic field d B due to an\nelement d l carrying a steady current I at a point P at a distance r from\nthe current element is:\n0\n3dd4Irµ×=πl rB\nTo obtain the total field at P, we must integrate this vector expression\nover the entire length of the conductor.\n5.The magnitude of the magnetic field due to a circular coil of radius R\ncarrying a current I at an axial distance x from the centre isEXAMPLE  4.12Solution\n(a)Total resistance in the circuit is,\n3 63GR+ = Ω .

Then the Ampere’s law states that B l.d I= ∫µ0\nC/integralloop where I refers to\nthe current passing through S. The sign of I is determined from the\nright-hand rule. We have discussed a simplified form of this law. If B\nis directed along the tangent to every point on the perimeter L of a\nclosed curve and is constant in magnitude along perimeter then,\nBL = µ0 Ie\nwhere Ie is the net current enclosed by the closed circuit.\n7.The magnitude of the magnetic field at a distance R from a long,\nstraight wire carrying a current I is given by:\nπ0\n2IBRµ=\nThe field lines are circles concentric with the wire.\n8.The magnitude of the field B inside a long solenoid  carrying a current\nI is\nB = µ0nI\nwhere n is the number of turns per unit length.\n9.Parallel currents attract and anti-parallel currents repel.\n10.A planar loop carrying a current I, having N closely wound turns, and\nan area A possesses a magnetic moment m where,\nm = N I A\nand the direction of m is given by the right-hand thumb rule : curl\nthe palm of your right hand along the loop with the fingers pointing\nin the direction of the current.

It can be\nconverted into a voltmeter by introducing a resistance of a large value\nin series.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPhysics\n134Physical Quantity Symbol Nature Dimensions Units Remarks\nPermeability of free µ0Scalar [MLT–2A–2] T m A–14π × 10–7 T m A–1\nspace\nMagnetic Field B Vector [M T–2A–1] T (telsa)\nMagnetic Moment m Vector [L2A] A m2 or J/T\nTorsion Constant k   Scalar [M L2T–2]    N m rad–1Appears in MCG\nPOINTS TO PONDER\n1.Electrostatic field lines originate at a positive charge and terminate at a\nnegative charge or fade at infinity.
