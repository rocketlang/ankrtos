Paheli knows\nthat air is a poor conductor of\nelectricity. But she has also read\nthat during lightning, an electric\ncurrent passes thr ough air . She\nwonders if air is indeed a poor\nconductor under all conditions.\nThis makes Boojho ask whether\nother materials classified as\npoor conductors also allow\nelectricity to pass under\ncertain conditions.\nFrom Table 11.1, we find that some\nliquids are good conductors of electricity\nand some are poor conductors.\nActually, under certain conditions\nmost materials can conduct. That is why\nit is preferable to classify materials as\ngood conductors and poor conductors\ninstead of classifying as conductors and\ninsulators.We have tested the conduction of\nelectricity thr ough tap water . Let us now\ntest the conduction of electricity through\ndistilled water .\nActivity 11.4\nTake about two teaspoonfuls of\ndistilled water in a clean and dry\nplastic or rubber cap of a bottle.

Small\namounts of mineral salts are naturally\npresent in it. This water is thus a good\nconductor of electricity.

He cut\na potato into two halves and\ninserted the copper wires of a tester\ninto it. Just then his mother called\nhim and he forgot to take out the\nwires of the tester inserted into the\npotato. When he came back after\nhalf an hour , he noticed that ther e\nwas a greenish blue spot on the\npotato around one wire whereas\nthere was no such spot around the\nother wire (Fig. 11.6).carbon rods, you may take two iron\nnails about 6 cm lon g.) Pour a\ncupful of water in a glass/plastic\nbowl. Add a teaspoonful of salt or a\nfew drops of lemon juice to water to\nmake it more conducting.  Now\nimmerse the electrodes in this\nsolution. Make sure that the metal\ncaps of the carbon rods are outside\nthe water . Wait for 3-4 minute s.\nObserve the electrodes carefully. Do\nyou notice any gas bubbles near the\nelectrodes? Can we  call the change\ntaking place in the solution a\nchemical change? Recall the\ndefinition of a chemical change that\nyou learnt in Class VII.\nIn 1800, a British chemist, William\nNicholson (1753–1815), had shown\nthat if electrodes\nwere immersed\nin water , and a\ncurrent was passed,\nbubbles of oxygen\nand hydrogen were\nproduced. Oxygen\nbubbles formed\non the electrode\nconnected to the positive terminal of\nthe battery and hydrogen bubbles\nformed on the other electrode.\nThe passage of an electric current\nthrough a conducting solution causes\nchemical reactions. As a result, bubbles\nof a gas may be formed on the electrodes.\nDeposits of metal may be seen on\nelectrodes. Changes of colour of\nsolutions may occur . The reaction would\ndepend on what solution and electrodes\nare used. These are some of the chemical\neffects of the electric current.\nFig. 11.6 :  Testing potato\nHe was surprised with this\nobservation and along with Paheli\nrepeated this activity many times. They\nfound that it was always the wire\nconnected to the positive terminal,\nwhich had a greenish blue spot around\nit. They felt that this discovery was very\nuseful because it could be used for\nidentifying the positive terminal of a\ncell or a battery  concealed in a box.\nThey decided to report their finding to\na children’s magazine.\nRemember that Boojho set out to\ntest whether potato conducted\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 144Allow the current to pass for\nabout 15 minutes. Now remove the\nelectrodes from the solution and\nlook at them carefully. Do you find\nany difference in any one of them?\nDo you find a coating over it? What\ncolour is the coating ? Note down \nthe\nterminal of the battery with which\nthis electrode is connected.electricity or not. What he found was\nthat current produced a chemical\neffect in the potato. To him this was\nvery exciting. In fact, this is how\nscience sometimes works. Y ou ar e\nlooking for something and you\ndiscover something else. Many\nimportant discoveries have been\nmade in this manner .\n11.3 Electroplating\nYou know  that a brand new bicycle has\nshiny handlebar and wheel rims.\nHowever , if these ar e accidentally\nscratched, the shiny coating comes off\nrevealing a not so shiny sur face beneath.\nYou might have also seen women using\nornaments, which appear  to be made of\ngold. However , with r epeated use, the\ngold coating wears off, revealing silver or\nsome other metal beneath.\nIn both these cases, a metal has a\ncoating of another metal. Do you wonder\nhow a layer of one metal can be\ndeposited on top of another? W ell, let\nus try doing it ourselves.\nActivity 11.7\nWe will need copper sulphate and\ntwo copper plates of size around\n10 cm × 4 cm. T ake 250 mL of\ndistilled water in a clean and dry\nbeaker . Dissolve two teaspoonfuls of\ncopper sulphate in it. Add a few drops\nof dilute sulphuric acid to copper\nsulphate solution to make it more\nconducting. Clean copper plates with\nsand paper . Now rinse them with\nwater and dry them.  Connect the\ncopper plate s to the terminals of a\nbattery \nand immerse them in copper\nsulphate solution (Fig. 11.7).When electric current is passed\nthrough the copper sulphate solution,\ncopper sulphate dissociates into\ncopper and sulphate. The free copper\ngets drawn to the electrode connected\nto the negative terminal of the battery\nand gets deposited on it.  But what\nabout the loss of copper from the\nsolution?\nFrom the other electrode, a  copper\nplate, an equal amount of copper gets\ndissolved in the solution. Thus, the\nAfter doing the electroplating\nactivity, Paheli interchanged\nthe electrodes and repeated\nthe activity. What do you think\nshe would observe this time?\nFig.1 1.7 : A simple circuit showing\nelectroplatingCopper plate\nCopper sul-\nphate\nsolutionCopper plate\n2024-25\n\nCHEMICAL  EFFECTS  OF ELECTRIC  CURRENT 145\nloss of copper from the solution is\nrestored  and the process continues .\nThis means that copper gets\ntransferred from one electrode to the\nother .\nIn the electroplating factories the\ndisposal of the used conducting\nsolution is a major concern. It is a\npolluting waste and there are specific\ndisposal guidelines to protect the\nenvironment.Fig. 11.8 :  Some electroplated objects\nsilver and gold on less expensive metals.\nThese ornaments have the appearance\nof silver or gold but are much less\nexpensive.\nTin cans, used for storing food, ar e\nmade by electr oplating tin onto ir on. T in\nis less reactive than iron. Thus, food\ndoes not come into contact with iron and\nis protected from getting spoilt.\nIron is used in bridges and\nautomobiles to provide strength.\nHowever , iron tends to corr ode and rust.\nSo, a coating of zinc is deposited on iron\nto protect it from corrosion and\nformation of rust.\nBoojho could get only one\ncopper plate. So he\nperformed Activity 11.7 by\nconnecting a carbon rod in\nplace of the copper plate\nwhich was connected to\nthe negative terminal of\nthe battery. He succeeded\nin obtaining a coating of\ncopper on carbon rod.\nThe process of depositing a layer of\nany desired metal on another material\nby means of electricity is called\nelectroplating . It is one of the most\ncommon applications of chemical effects\nof electric current.\nElectroplating is a very useful\nprocess. It is widely used in industry\nfor coating metal objects with a thin\nlayer of a different metal (Fig.11.8). The\nlayer of metal deposited has some\ndesired property, which the metal of the\nobject lacks. For example, chromium\nplating is done on many objects such\nas car parts, bath taps, kitchen gas\nburners, bicycle handlebars, wheel rims\nand many others.\nChromium has a shiny appearance.\nIt does not corrode. It resists scratches.\nHowever , chromium is expensive and it\nmay not be economical to make the\nwhole object out of chromium. So the\nobject is made from a cheaper metal and\nonly a coating of chromium over it is\ndeposited.

Y ou would conclude that\n(i)liquid A is a better conductor than liquid B.\n(ii)liquid B is a better conductor than liquid A.\n(iii) both liquids are equally conducting.\n(iv) conducting pr operties of liquid cannot be compar ed in this manner .\n6. Does pure water conduct electricity? If not, what can we do to make it\nconducting?\n7. In case of a fire, before the firemen use the water hoses, they shut off the\nmain electrical supply for the area. Explain why they do this.\n8. A child staying in a coastal region tests the drinking water and also the\nseawater with his tester . He finds that the compass needle deflects mor e\nin the case of seawater. Can you explain the reason?\n9. Is it safe for the electrician to carry out electrical repairs outdoors during\nheavy downpour? Explain.\n10. Paheli had heard that rainwater is as good as distilled water . So she\ncollected some rainwater in a clean glass tumbler and tested it using a\ntester . To her surprise she found that the compass needle showed\ndeflection.  What could be the reasons?\n",

Copper from impure rod is sought to be transfered to the thin\ncopper plate. Which electrode should be attached to the positive terminal\nof the battery and why?E X E R C I S E S\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 148Extended Learning — Activities and Projects\n1.Test the conduction of electricity through various fruits and\nvegetables. Display your result in a tabular form.\n2.Repeat Activity 11.7 with a zinc plate in place of the copper plate\nconnected to the negative terminal of the battery. Now replace zinc\nplate with some other metallic object and again repeat the activity.\nWhich metal gets deposited over which other metal? Discuss your\nfindings with your friends.\n3.Find out if there is a commercial electroplating unit in your town.\nWhat objects are electroplated there and for what purpose? (The\nprocess of electroplating in a commercial unit is much more complex\nthan what we did in Activity 11.7). Find out how they dispose off the\nchemicals they discard.\n4.Imagine that you are an ‘entrepreneur’ and have been provided a\nloan by a bank to set up a small electroplating unit. What object\nwould you like to electroplate and for what purpose? (Look up the\nmeaning of ‘entrepreneur’ in a dictionary).\n5.Find out the health concerns associated with chromium\nelectroplating. How are people trying to resolve them?\n6.You can make a fun pen for yourself. T ake a conducting metal plate\nand spread a moist paste of potassium iodide and starch. Connect\nthe plate to a battery as shown in Fig. 11.11. Now using the free\nend of the wire, write a few letters on the paste. What do you see?\nFig. 11.11\n2024-25\n\nCHEMICAL  EFFECTS  OF ELECTRIC  CURRENT 149Did Y ou Know?\nLEDs (Light Emitting Diodes) are available in\nmany colours such as red, green, yellow, blue,\nwhite and are increasingly being used for many\napplications, for example in traffic signal lights.\nLEDs are increasingly being used for lighting. A\ncluster of white LEDs grouped together forms a\nLED light source. LED light sources consume\nless electricity and have longer lifetime  than\nlight bulbs and fluorescent tubes. Hence these\nare gradually becoming the preferred lighting\nsource.\nFor more information on this topic visit:\nlelectronics.howstuffworks.com/led.htm\n2024-25\n\n",
