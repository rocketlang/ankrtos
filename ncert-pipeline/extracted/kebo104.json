This pattern is called organ system\nlevel of organisation. Organ systems in different\ngroups of animals exhibit various patterns of\ncomplexities. For example, the digestive system\nin Platyhelminthes has only a single opening\nto the outside of the body that serves as both\nmouth and anus, and is hence called\nincomplete.  A complete digestive system has\ntwo openings, mouth and anus. Similarly, the\ncirculatory system may be of two types:\n(i) open type  in which the blood is pumped\nout of the heart and the cells and tissues are\ndirectly bathed in it and\n(ii) closed type  in which the blood is circulated\nthrough a series of vessels of varying diameters\n(arteries, veins and capillaries).\n4.1.2 Symmetry\nAnimals can be categorised on the basis of their\nsymmetry. Sponges are mostly  asymmetrical,\ni.e., any plane that passes through the centre\ndoes not divide them into equal halves. When\nany plane passing through the central axis of\nthe body divides the organism into two identical\nhalves, it is called radial symmetry .\nCoelenterates, ctenophores and echinoderms\nhave this kind of body plan (Figure 4.1a).\nAnimals like annelids, arthropods, etc., where\nthe body can be divided into identical left and\nright halves in only one plane, exhibit bilateral\nsymmetry (Figure 4.1b).\n4.1.3 Diploblastic and Triploblastic\nOrganisation\nAnimals in which the cells are arranged in two\nembryonic layers, an external ectoderm  and\nan internal endoderm , are called diploblastic\nanimals, e.g., coelenterates. An undifferentiated\nlayer, mesoglea, is pr esent in between the\nectoderm and the endoderm (Figure 4.2a).Figure 4.2 Showing germinal layers :\n(a) Diploblastic (b) Triploblastic(a) (b)EctodermMesoglea\nEndoder m\nMesoder mFigure 4.1 (b) Bilateral symmetry\nFigure 4.1 (a)  Radial symmetry\nReprint 2025-26\n\nANIMAL KINGDOM 3939\n4.1.4 Coelom\nPresence or absence of a cavity between the body\nwall and the gut wall is very important in\nclassification. The body cavity, which is lined\nby mesoderm is called coelom . Animals\npossessing coelom are called coelomates,  e.g.,\nannelids, molluscs, arthropods, echinoderms,\nhemichordates and chordates (Figure 4.3a). In\nsome animals, the body cavity is not lined by\nmesoderm, instead, the mesoderm is present as\nscattered pouches in between the ectoderm and\nendoderm. Such a body cavity is called\npseudocoelom and the animals possessing them\nare called pseudocoelomates,  e.g.,\naschelminthes (Figure 4.3b). The animals in\nwhich the body cavity is absent are called\nacoelomates,  e.g., platyhelminthes (Figure 4.3c).Figure 4.3 Diagrammatic sectional view of :\n(a) Coelomate (b) Pseudocoelomate\n(c) AcoelomateThose animals in which the developing embryo has a third germinal layer ,\nmesoderm , in between the ectoderm and endoderm, are called\ntriploblastic  animals (platyhelminthes to chordates, Figure 4.2b).\n4.1.5 Segmentation\nIn some animals, the body is externally and internally divided into\nsegments with a serial repetition of at least some organs. For example, in\nearthworm, the body shows this pattern called metameric segmentation\nand the phenomenon is known as metamerism .\n4.1.6 Notochord\nNotochord is a mesodermally derived rod-like structure formed on the\ndorsal side during embryonic development in some animals. Animals with\nnotochord are called chordates and those animals which do not form this\nstructure are called non-chordates, e.g., porifera to echinoderms.\n4.2CLASSIFICATION  OF ANIMALS\nThe broad classification of A nimalia, based on common fundamental\nfeatures as mentioned in the preceding sections, is given in Figure  4.4.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n40 BIOLOGY\nThe important characteristic features of the\ndifferent phyla are described.\n4.2.1 Phylum – Porifera\nMembers of this phylum are commonly known\nas sponges. They are generally marine and mostly\nasymmetrical animals (Figure 4.5). These are\nprimitive multicellular animals and have cellular\nlevel of organisation. Sponges have a water\ntransport or canal system. W ater enters thr ough\nminute pores ( ostia) in the body wall into a central\ncavity, spongocoel , from where it goes out\nthrough the osculum . This pathway of water\ntransport is helpful in food gathering, respiratory\nexchange and removal of waste. Choanocytes\nor collar cells line the spongocoel and the canals.\nDigestion is intracellular . The body is supported\nby a skeleton made up of spicules  or \nspongin\nfibres . Sexes are not separate ( hermaphrodite ),\ni.e., eggs and sperms are produced by the same\nindividual. Sponges reproduce asexually by\nfragmentation and sexually by formation of\ngametes. Fertilisation is internal and development\nis indirect having a larval stage which is\nmorphologically distinct from the adult.*Echinodermata exhibits radial or bilateral symmetry depending on the stage.\nFigure 4.4  Broad classification of Kingdom Animalia based on common fundamental features\n(a)(b)\n(c)\nFigure 4.5 Examples of Porifera : (a) Sycon\n(b) Euspongia   (c) Spongilla\nReprint 2025-26\n\nANIMAL KINGDOM 4141\ncnidoblasts or cnidocytes (which contain the stinging capsules or\nnematocysts) present on the tentacles and the body. Cnidoblasts are used\nfor anchorage, defense and for the capture of prey (Figure 4.7). Cnidarians\nexhibit tissue level of organisation and are diploblastic. They have a central\ngastro-vascular cavity with a single opening, mouth on  hypostome .\nDigestion is extracellular and intracellular . Some of the cnidarians, e.g.,\ncorals  have a skeleton composed of calcium carbonate. Cnidarians exhibit\ntwo basic body forms called polyp and medusa (Figure 4.6). The former\nis a sessile and cylindrical form like Hydra, Adamsia , etc. whereas, the\nlatter is umbrella-shaped and free-swimming like Aurelia  or jelly fish.\nThose cnidarians which exist in both forms exhibit alternation of\ngenerations (M etagenesis), i.e., polyps produce medusae asexually and\nmedusae form the polyps sexually (e.g., Obelia ).\nExamples: Physalia  (Portuguese man-of-war), Adamsia  (Sea anemone),\nPennatula  (Sea-pen), Gorgonia  (Sea-fan) and Meandrina  (Brain coral).\nFigure 4.7\nDiagrammatic view of\nCnidoblastFigure 4.6 Examples of  Coelenterata indicating outline of their body form :\n(a) Aurelia  (Medusa) (b) Adamsia (Polyp)\n(b) (a)Examples: Sycon  (Scypha), Spongilla (Fresh water sponge)  and Euspongia\n(Bath sponge).\n4.2.2 Phylum – Coelenterata (Cnidaria)\nThey are aquatic, mostly marine, sessile or free-swimming, radially\nsymmetrical animals (Figure 4.6). The name cnidaria is derived from the\nReprint 2025-26\n\n42 BIOLOGY\n4.2.3 Phylum – Ctenophora\nCtenophores, commonly known as sea walnuts  or comb\njellies  are exclusively marine, radially symmetrical, diploblastic\norganisms with tissue level of organisation. The body bears\neight external rows of ciliated comb plates , which help in\nlocomotion (Figure 4.8). Digestion is both extracellular and\nintracellular . Bioluminescence  (the pr operty of a living\norganism to emit light) is well-marked in ctenophores. Sexes\nare not separate. Reproduction takes place only by sexual\nmeans. Fertilisation is external with indirect development.\nExamples: Pleurobrachia  and Ctenoplana .\n4.2.4 Phylum – Platyhelminthes\nThey have dorso-ventrally flattened body, hence are called\nflatworms (Figure 4.9). These are mostly endoparasites found\nin animals including human beings. Flatworms are bilaterally\nsymmetrical, triploblastic and acoelomate animals with organ\nlevel of organisation. Hooks and suckers are present in the\nparasitic forms. Some of them absorb nutrients from the host\ndirectly through their body surface. Specialised cells called\nflame cells help in osmoregulation and excretion. Sexes are not\nseparate. Fertilisation is internal and development is through\nmany larval stages. Some members like Planaria  possess high\nregeneration capacity.\nExamples: Taenia  (Tapeworm), \nFasciola (Liver fluke).Figure 4.8 Example of\nCtenophora\n(Pleurobrachia )\n(a)(b)\nFigure 4.9 Examples of Platyhelminthes : (a) Tape worm (b) Liver fluke\nReprint 2025-26\n\nANIMAL KINGDOM 4343\n4.2.5 Phylum – Aschelminthes\nThe body of the aschelminthes is circular in\ncross-section, hence, the name roundworms\n(Figure 4.10). They may be freeliving, aquatic\nand terrestrial or parasitic in plants and animals.\nRoundworms have organ-system level of body\norganisation. They are bilaterally symmetrical,\ntriploblastic and pseudocoelomate animals.\nAlimentary canal is complete with a well-\ndeveloped \nmuscular pharynx.  An excretory\ntube removes body wastes from the body cavity\nthrough the excretory pore. Sexes are separate\n(dioecious ), i.e., males and females are distinct.\nOften females are longer than males. Fertilisation\nis internal and development may be direct (the\nyoung ones resemble the adult) or indirect.\nExamples : Ascaris (Roundwor m), Wucher eria\n(Filaria worm), Ancylostoma (Hookworm).\n4.2.6 Phylum – Annelida\nThey may be aquatic (marine and fresh water) or\nterrestrial; free-living, and sometimes parasitic.\nThey exhibit organ-system level of body\norganisation and bilateral symmetry. They are\ntriploblastic, metamerically segmented and\ncoelomate animals. Their body surface is\ndistinctly marked out into segments  or\nmetameres  and, hence, the phylum name\nAnnelida (Latin, annulus  : little ring) (Figure 4.11).\nThey possess longitudinal and circular muscles\nwhich help in locomotion. Aquatic annelids like\nNereis possess lateral appendages, parapodia ,\nwhich help in swimming. A closed circulatory\nsystem is present. Nephridia  (sing. nephridium)\nhelp in osmoregulation and excretion. Neural\nsystem consists of paired ganglia (sing. ganglion)\nconnected by lateral nerves to a double ventral\nnerve cord. Nereis, an aquatic form, is dioecious,\nbut earthworms and leeches are monoecious.\nReproduction is sexual.\nExamples : Nereis , Pheretima  (Earthworm) and\nHirudinaria  (Blood sucking leech).Figure 4.11 Examples of Annelida : (a) Nereis\n(b) HirudinariaMale Female\nFigure 4.10 Example of\nAschelminthes:\nRoundworm\nReprint 2025-26\n\n44 BIOLOGY\n4.2.7 Phylum – Arthropoda\nThis is the largest phylum of Animalia which\nincludes insects. Over two-thirds of all named\nspecies on earth are arthropods (Figure 4.12).\nThey have organ-system level of organisation.\nThey are bilaterally symmetrical, triploblastic,\nsegmented and coelomate animals. The body\nof arthropods is covered by chitinous\nexoskeleton. The body consists of head , thorax\nand abdomen . They have jointed appendages\n(arthros-joint, poda-appendages). Respiratory\norgans are gills, book gills, book lungs or\ntracheal system. Circulatory system is of open\ntype. Sensory organs like antennae, eyes\n(compound and simple), statocysts or\nbalancing organs are present.  Excretion takes\nplace through malpighian tubules . They are\nmostly dioecious. Fertilisation is usually\ninternal. They are mostly oviparous.\nDevelopment may be direct or indirect.\nExamples: Economically important insects \n–\nApis (Honey bee), Bombyx  (Silkworm), Laccifer\n(Lac insect)\nVectors – Anopheles, Culex and Aedes\n(Mosquitoes)\nGregarious pest – Locusta (Locust)\nLiving fossil – Limulus (King crab).\n4.2.8 Phylum – Mollusca\nThis is the second largest  animal phylum\n(Figure 4.13). Molluscs are terrestrial or aquatic\n(marine or fresh water) having an organ-system\nlevel of organisation. They are bilaterally\nsymmetrical, triploblastic and coelomate\nanimals. Body is covered by a calcareous shell\nand is unsegmented with a distinct head ,\nmuscular foot  and visceral hump . A soft and\nspongy layer of skin forms a mantle over the\nvisceral hump. The space between the hump\nand the mantle is called the mantle cavity in\nwhich feather like gills are present. They have\nrespiratory and excretory functions. The\nanterior head region has sensory tentacles. The\nmouth contains a file-like rasping organ for\nfeeding, called radula .Figure 4.12 Examples of Arthropoda  :\n(a) Locust (b) Butterfly\n(c) Scorpion (d) Prawn\n (a)\n (c)\n (b)\n (d)\nFigure 4.13 Examples of Mollusca  :\n(a) Pila  (b) Octopus\n(b)\n(a)\nReprint 2025-26\n\nANIMAL KINGDOM 4545\nThey are usually dioecious and oviparous with indirect\ndevelopment.\nExamples: Pila (Apple snail), Pinctada (Pearl oyster), Sepia\n(Cuttlefish), Loligo  (Squid), Octopus  (Devil fish), Aplysia  (Sea-\nhare), Dentalium  (Tusk shell) and Chaetopleura  (Chiton).\n4.2.9 Phylum – Echinodermata\nThese animals have an endoskeleton of calcareous ossicles\nand, hence, the name Echinodermata (Spiny bodied, Figure\n4.14). All are marine with organ-system level of organisation.\nThe adult echinoderms are radially symmetrical but larvae\nare bilaterally symmetrical. They are triploblastic and\ncoelomate animals. Digestive system is complete with mouth\non the lower (ventral) side and anus on the upper (dorsal)\nside. The most distinctive feature of echinoderms is the\npresence of water vascular system  which helps in\nlocomotion, capture and transport of food and respiration.\nAn excretory system is absent. Sexes are separate.\nReproduction is sexual. Fertilisation is usually external.\nDevelopment is indirect with free-swimming larva.\nExamples: Asterias  (Star fish), Echinus  (Sea urchin), Antedon\n(Sea lily), Cucumaria (Sea cucumber) and Ophiura  (Brittle star).\n4.2.10 Phylum – Hemichordata\nHemichordata was earlier considered as a sub-phylum under\nphylum Chordata. But now it is placed as a separate phylum\nunder non-chordata. Hemichordates have a rudimentary\nstructure in the collar region called stomochord, a structure\nsimilar to notochord.\nThis phylum consists of a small group of \nworm-like\nmarine animals with organ-system level of organisation. They\nare bilaterally symmetrical, triploblastic and coelomate\nanimals. The body is cylindrical and is composed of an\nanterior proboscis , a collar  and a long trunk  (Figure 4.15).\nCirculatory system is of  open type. Respiration takes place\nthrough gills. Excretory organ is proboscis gland. Sexes are\nseparate. Fertilisation is external. Development is indirect.\nExamples: Balanoglossus  and Saccoglossus.\n4.2.11 Phylum – Chordata\nAnimals belonging to phylum Chordata are fundamentally\ncharacterised by the presence of a notochord , a dorsal\nFigure 4.14 Examples of\nEchinodermata :\n(a) Asterias\n(b) Ophiura\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 4.15 BalanoglossusProboscis\nCollar\nTrunk\nReprint 2025-26\n\n46 BIOLOGY\nhollow nerve cord  and paired pharyngeal\ngill slits  (Figure 4.16). These are bilaterally\nsymmetrical, triploblastic,  coelomate with\norgan-system level of organisation. They\npossess a post anal tail and a closed circulatory\nsystem.\nTable 4.1 presents a comparison of salient\nfeatures of chordates and non-chordates.\nPhylum Chordata is divided into three\nsubphyla: Urochordata  or Tunicata ,\nCephalochordata  and Vertebrata .\nSubphyla Urochordata and\nCephalochordata are often referred to as\nprotochordates  (Figure 4.17) and are\nexclusively marine. In Urochordata, notochord\nis present only in larval tail, while in\nCephalochordata, it extends from head to tail\nregion and is persistent throughout their life.\nExamples: Urochordata – Ascidia, Salpa,\nDoliolum;  Cephalochordata – Branchiostoma\n(Amphioxus or Lancelet) .\nThe members of subphylum V ertebrata\npossess notochord during the embryonic\nperiod. The notochord is replaced by a\ncartilaginous or bony vertebral column  in the\nadult. Thus all vertebrates are chordates but\nall chordates are not vertebrates. Besides the\nbasic chordate characters, vertebrates have a\nventral muscular heart with two, three or four\nchambers, kidneys for excretion and\nosmoregulation and paired appendages which\nmay be fins or limbs.\nNerve cord Notochord\nPost-anal part\nGill slits\nFigure 4.16  Chordata characteristics\nFigure 4.17  Ascidia\nTABLE 4.1 Comparison of Chordates and Non-chordates\nS.No. Chordates Non-chordates\n1.

They have an\nelongated body bearing 6-15 pairs of \ngill slits\nfor respiration. Cyclostomes have a sucking and\ncircular mouth without jaws (Fig. 4.18). Their\nbody is devoid of scales and paired fins.\nCranium and vertebral column are\ncartilaginous. Circulation is of closed type.\nCyclostomes are marine but migrate for\nspawning to fr esh water . After spawning, within\na few days, they die. Their larvae, after\nmetamorphosis, return to the ocean.\nExamples: Petromyzon  (Lamprey) and Myxine\n(Hagfish).\n4.2.11.2 4.2.11.24.2.11.2 4.2.11.24.2.11.2 Class – ChondrichthyesClass – ChondrichthyesClass – ChondrichthyesClass – ChondrichthyesClass – Chondrichthyes\nThey are marine animals with streamlined body\nand have cartilaginous endoskeleton\n(Figure 4.19). Mouth is located ventrally.\nNotochord  is persistent throughout life. Gill\nslits are separate and without operculum (gill\ncover). The skin is tough, containing minute\nplacoid scales.  Teeth are modified placoid\nscales which are backwardly directed. Their\njaws are very powerful. These animals are\npredaceous.  Due to the absence of air bladder ,\nthey have to swim constantly to avoid sinking.Vertebrata\nDivision\nAgnatha\n(lacks jaw)\nClass\n1.

Besides the fundamental features,\nthere are many other distinctive characters which are specific for each\nphyla or class.\nPorifera includes multicellular animals which exhibit cellular level of\norganisation and have characteristic flagellated choanocytes. The\ncoelenterates have tentacles and bear cnidoblasts. They are mostly aquatic,\nsessile or free-floating. The ctenophores are marine animals with comb\nplates. The platyhelminths have flat body and exhibit bilateral symmetry.\nThe parasitic forms show distinct suckers and hooks. Aschelminthes are\npseudocoelomates and  include parasitic as well as non-parasitic\nroundworms.\nAnnelids are metamerically segmented animals with a true coelom.\nThe arthropods are the most abundant group of animals characterised\nby the presence of jointed appendages. The molluscs have a soft body\nsurrounded by an external calcareous shell. The body is covered with\nexternal skeleton made of chitin. The echinoderms possess a spiny skin.\nTheir most distinctive feature is the presence of water vascular system.\nThe hemichordates are a small group of worm-like marine animals. They\nhave a cylindrical body with proboscis, collar and trunk.\nPhylum Chordata includes animals which possess a notochord either\nthroughout or during early embryonic life. Other common features\nobserved in the chordates are the dorsal, hollow nerve cord and paired\npharyngeal gill slits. Some of the vertebrates do not possess jaws (Agnatha)\nwhereas most of them possess jaws (Gnathostomata). Agnatha is\nrepresented by the class, Cyclostomata. They are the most primitive\nchordates and are ectoparasites on fishes. Gnathostomata has two super\nclasses, Pisces and Tetrapoda. Classes Chondrichthyes and Osteichthyes\nbear fins for locomotion and are grouped under Pisces. The\nChondrichthyes are fishes with cartilaginous endoskeleton and are marine.\nClasses, Amphibia, Reptilia, Aves and Mammalia have two pairs of limbs\nand are thus grouped under Tetrapoda. The amphibians have adapted\nto live both on land and water . Reptiles ar e characterised by the pr esence\nReprint 2025-26\n\nANIMAL KINGDOM 5353\nof dry and cornified skin. Limbs are absent in snakes. Fishes, amphibians\nand reptiles are poikilothermous (cold-blooded). Aves are warm-blooded\nanimals with feathers on their bodies and forelimbs modified into wings\nfor flying. Hind limbs are adapted for walking, swimming, perching or\nclasping. The unique features of mammals are the presence of mammary\nglands and hairs on the skin. They commonly exhibit viviparity.\nEXERCISES\n1.What are the difficulties that you would face in classification of animals,\nif common fundamental features are not taken into account?\n2.If you are given a specimen, what are the steps that you would follow to\nclassify it?\n3.How useful is the study of the nature of body cavity and coelom in the\nclassification of animals?\n4.Distinguish between intracellular and extracellular digestion?\n5.What is the difference between direct and indirect development?\n6.What are the peculiar features that you find in parasitic\nplatyhelminthes?\n7.What are the reasons that you can think of for the arthropods to\nconstitute the largest group of the animal kingdom?\n8.Water vascular system is the characteristic of which gr oup of the\nfollowing:\n(a) Porifera  (b) Ctenophora  (c) Echinodermata  (d) Chordata\n9.“All vertebrates are chordates but all chordates are not vertebrates”.\nJustify the statement.\n10.How important is the presence of air bladder in Pisces?\n11.What are the modifications that are observed in birds that help them\nfly?\n12.Could the number of eggs or young ones produced by an oviparous and\nviviparous mother be equal? Why?\n13.Segmentation in the body is first observed in which of the following:\n(a) Platyhelminthes  (b) Aschelminthes  (c) Annelida  (d) Arthropoda\nReprint 2025-26\n\n54 BIOLOGY\n14.Match the following:\n(a)Operculum (i)Ctenophora\n(b)Parapodia (ii)Mollusca\n(c)Scales (iii)Porifera\n(d)Comb plates (iv)Reptilia\n(e)Radula (v)Annelida\n(f)Hairs (vi)Cyclostomata and Chondrichthyes\n(g)Choanocytes (vii) Mammalia\n(h)Gill slits (viii) Osteichthyes\n15.Prepare a list of some animals that are found parasitic on human\nbeings.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n",
