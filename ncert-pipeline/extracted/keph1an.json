When you push, the\nnormal force ( N) must be more than its weight, for equilibrium in the vertical direction.\nThis results in greater friction f ( f ∝ N\n) and, therefore, a greater applied force to move.\nJust the opposite happens while pulling.\n(d) To reduce the rate of change of momentum and hence to reduce the force necessary\nto stop the ball.\n",
