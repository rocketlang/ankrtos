So\nthese methods ar e cheaper ,\nbut less efficient. The various\ntraditional ways are:\n(i)moat (pulle y-system)\n(ii)chain pump\n(iii)dhekli, and\n(iv)rahat\n (Lever system)\n[Figs. 1.4 (a)- (d)].\nPumps are commonly\nused for lifting water . Diesel,\nbiogas, electricity and\nsolar energy is used to run\nthese pumps.\n2024-25\n\nCROP PRODUCTION  AND MANAGEMENT 9Modern Methods of\nIrrigation\nModern methods of irrigation\nhelp us to use water\neconomically. The main\nmethods used are as follows:\n(i)Sprinkler System: This\nsystem is more useful on the\nuneven land where sufficient\nwater is not available. The\nperpendicular pipes, having\nrotating nozzles on top, are\njoined to the main pipeline\nat regular intervals. When\nwater is allowed to flow\nthrough the main pipe under pressure\nwith the help of a pump, it escapes from\nthe rotating nozzles. It gets sprinkled\non the crop as if it is raining.\nSprinkler is very useful for lawns, coffee\nplantation and several other crops\n[Fig. 1.5 (a)].\nFig. 1.5 (b) :  Drip System\nFig. 1.5 (a) :  Sprinkler system\n(ii)Drip system : In this system, the\nwater falls drop by drop directly near\nthe roots. So it is called drip system. It\nis the best technique for watering fruit\nplants,  gardens and trees [Fig. 1.5(b)].\nWater is  not wasted at all. It is a boon in\nregions wher e availability of water is poor .\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 101.7 Pr otection fr om W eeds\nBoojho and Paheli went to a nearby\nwheat field and saw that there were some\nother plants in the field, growing along\nwith wheat plants.\nHave these other\nplants been planted\npurposely?\nIn a field many other undesirable\nplants may grow naturally along with\nthe crop. These undesirable plants are\ncalled weeds .\nThe removal of weeds is called\nweeding. W eeding is necessary since\nweeds compete with the crop plants for\nwater , nutrients, space and light. Thus,\nthey affect the growth of the crop. Some\nweeds inter fere even in harvesting and\nmay be poisonous for animals and\nhuman beings.\nFarmers adopt many ways to remove\nweeds and contr ol their growth. T illing\nbefore sowing of crops helps in\nuprooting and killing of weeds, which\nmay then dry up and get mixed with\nthe soil. The best time for the removal\nof weeds is before they produce flowers\nand seeds. The manual removal includes\nphysical removal of weeds by uprooting\nor cutting them close to the ground,\nfrom time to time. This is done with the\nhelp of a \nkhurpi. A seed drill [Fig. 1.2(b)]\nis also used to uproot weeds.\nWeeds ar e also controlled by using\ncertain chemicals, called weedicides ,\nlike 2,4-D. These are sprayed in the\nfields to kill the weeds. They do not\ndamage the crops. The weedicides are\ndiluted with water to the extent required\nand sprayed in the fields with a sprayer .\n(Fig. 1.6).\nDo weedicides have any\neffect on the person handling\nthe weedicide sprayer?Fig. 1.6 : Spraying weedicide\nAs already mentioned, the  weedicides\nare sprayed during the vegetative growth\nof weeds before flowering and seed\nformation. Spraying of weedicides may\naffect the health of  farmer s. So they\nshould use these chemicals very carefully.\nThey should cover their nose and mouth\nwith a piece of cloth during spraying of\nthese chemicals.\n1.8Harvesting\nHarvesting of a crop is an important\ntask. The cutting of crop after it is\nmature is called harvesting . In\nharvesting, crops are pulled out or cut\nclose to the ground. It usually takes 3\nto 4 months for a cereal crop to mature.\nHarvesting in our\ncountry is either done\nmanually by sickle\n(Fig. 1.7) or by a machine\ncalled harvester . In the\nharvested crop, the grain\nseeds need to be separatedFig. 1.7 :\nSickle\n2024-25\n\nCROP PRODUCTION  AND MANAGEMENT 11from the chaff. This process is called\nthreshing . This is carried out with the\nhelp of a machine called ‘combine’ which\nis in fact a  harvester as well as a  thresher\n(Fig. 1.8).\nFig. 1.8 :  Combine\nAfter harvesting, sometimes\nstubs are left in the field, which\nare burnt by farmers. Paheli is\nworried. She knows that it\ncauses pollution. It may also\ncatch fire and damage the crops\nlying in the fields.\nHarvest Festivals\nAfter three or four months of hard\nwork there comes the day of the\nharvest. The sight of golden fields\nof standing crop, laden with grain,\nfills the hearts of farmers with joy\nand a sense of well -being. The\nefforts of the past season have\nborne fruit and it is time to relax\nand enjoy a little. The period of\nharvest is, thus, of great joy and\nhappiness in all parts of India.\nMen and women celebrate it with\ngreat enthusiasm. Special\nfestivals associated with the\nharvest season are Pongal,\nBaisakhi, Holi, Diwali, Nabanya\nand Bihu.\n1.9Storage\nStorage of produce is an important task.\nIf the harvested grains are to be kept\nfor longer time, they should be safe\nfrom moisture, insects, rats and\nmicroorganisms. Harvested grains have\nmore moisture. If freshly harvested\ngrains (seeds) are stored without drying,\nthey may get spoilt or attacked by\norganisms, making them unfit for use\nor for germination. Hence, before\nstoring them, the grains are properly\ndried in the sun to reduce the moisture\nin them. This prevents the attack by\ninsect pests, bacteria and fungi.Farmers with small holdings of land\ndo the separation of grain and chaff by\nwinnowing (Fig. 1.9). Y ou have alr eady\nstudied this in Class VI.\nFig. 1.9 : Winnowing machine\nI saw my mother putting\nsome dried neem leaves\nin an iron drum\ncontaining wheat.\nI wonder why?\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 121.10 Food from Animals\nFig. 1.10 (a) :  Silos for storage of grains\nFig. 1.10 (b) : Storage of grains in\ngunny bags in granaries\nFarmers store grains in jute bags or\nmetallic bins. However , large scale\nstorage of grains is done in silos  and\ngranaries  to protect them from pests\nlike rats and insects [Fig. 1.10 (a)\nand (b)].\nDried neem leaves are used for\nstoring food grains at home. For storing\nlarge quantities of grains in big\ngodowns, specific chemical treatments\nare required to protect them from pests\nand microorganisms.Activity 1.3\nMake the following Table in your\nnote book and complete it.\nS.No. Food Sources\n1.

Many people living in the\ncoastal areas consume fish as a major\npart of their diet. In the previous classes\nyou have learnt about the food that we\nobtain fr om plants. W e have just seen\nthat the process of crop production\ninvolves a number of steps like selection\nof seeds, sowing, etc. Similarly, animals\nreared at home or in farms, have to be\nprovided with proper food, shelter and\ncare. When this is done on a large scale,\nit is called animal husbandry.\n2024-25\n\nCROP PRODUCTION  AND MANAGEMENT 13\n     KEYWORDSKEYWORDSKEYWORDSKEYWORDSKEYWORDS\nAGRICULTURAL\nPRACTICES\nANIMAL HUSBANDRY\nCROP\nFERTILISER\nGRANARIES\nHARVESTING\nIRRIGA TION\nKHARIF\nMANURE\nPLOUGH\nRABI\nSEEDS\nSILO\nSOWING\nSTORAGE\nTHRESHING\nWEEDS\nWEEDICIDE\nWINNOWING WHA  WHA WHA  WHA WHA T YT YT Y T YT YOU HA OU HAOU HA OU HAOU HA VE LEARNTVE LEARNTVE LEARNTVE LEARNTVE LEARNT\n/circlerightIn order to provide food to our growing\npopulation, we need to adopt certain\nagricultural practices.\n/circlerightSame kind of plants cultivated at a place\nconstitute a crop.\n/circlerightIn India, crops can be broadly categorised into\ntwo types based on seasons - rabi and kharif\ncrops.\n/circlerightIt is necessary to prepare soil by tilling and\nlevelling.

Please guide\nus.\nShri Patel :Namaskar  and welcome all of you. What are your queries?\nSabiha :When did you start this work and what are the main crops that\nyou grow?\nShri Patel :About 75 years ago, my grandfather started this work. The main\ncrops that we grow are wheat, gram, soyabean and moong .\nDavid :Sir, can you tell us the dif ference between traditional and moder n\nagricultural practices?\nShri Patel :Earlier we used traditional tools like sickle, bullock plough, trowel,\netc., and depended on rain water for irrigation. But now we use\nmoder n methods of irrigation. W e use implements like tractors,\ncultivators, seed drill and harvester . We get good quality seeds.\nWe carry out soil testing and use manur e and fertilisers. New\ninformation about agricultur e is obtained thr ough radio, T .V. and\nother sources. As a result we are able to get good crops on a large\nscale. This year we got 9 to 11 quintals of gram crop/acre and 20\nto 25 quintals of wheat/acre. In my opinion awareness of new\ntechnology is important for better crop yield.\nMohan :Sabiha, come here and see some earthworms.
