      "content": "Chapter 2Federalism\nOverview\nIn the previous chapter, we noted that vertical division of power among \ndifferent levels of government is one of the major forms of power-sharing in modern democracies. In this chapter, we focus on this form of power-sharing. It is most commonly referred to as federalism. We begin by describing federalism in general terms. The rest of the chapter tries to understand the theory and practice of federalism in India. A discussion of the federal constitutional provisions is followed by an analysis of the policies and politics that has strengthened federalism in practice. Towards the end of the chapter, we turn to the local government, a new and third tier of Indian federalism. \nChapter 2.indd   13 08-04-2022   12:30:48\nReprint 2025-26\n\n14\nDemocratic PoliticsWhat is federalism? \nI am confused. \nWhat do we call the Indian government? Is it Union, Federal or Central?\nThough only 25 of the world’s 193 countries have federal political systems, their citizens make up 40 per cent of the \nworld’s population. Most of the large countries of the world are federations. Can you notice an exception to this rule in this map?\nSource: Montreal and Kingston,  Handbook of Federal Countries: 2002 , McGill-Queen’s University Press, 2002.Federal\npolitical systems\nCanada\nUnited Statesof America\nMexico\nPa\nCiFiC OCean\nMicronesia\nArgentinaVenezuela\natlanti C\nOCean BrazilSt. Kittsand NevisBelgium\nSwitzerland\nSpain\nNigeria\nEthiopia\nComorosBosnia andHerzegovinaAustria\nPakistanRussia\nIndia\nMalaysia\nAustraliaindian\nOCean\nSouth AfricaPaCiFiC OCean\nUnitedArabEmiratesGermanyLet us get back to the contrast \nbetween Belgium and Sri Lanka that we saw in the last chapter. You would recall that one of the key changes made in the Constitution of Belgium was to reduce the power of the Central Government and to give these powers to the regional governments. Regional governments existed in Belgium even earlier. They had their roles and powers. But all these powers were given to these governments and could be withdrawn by the Central Government. The change that took place in 1993 was that the regional governments were given constitutional powers that were no longer dependent on the central government. Thus, Belgium shifted from a unitary to a federal form of government. Sri Lanka continues to be, for all practical purposes, a \nunitary system where the national government has all the powers. Tamil leaders want Sri Lanka to become a federal system.\nFederalism is a system of \ngovernment in which the power is divided between a central authority and various constituent units of the country. Usually, a federation has two levels of government. One is the government for the entire country that is usually responsible for a few subjects of common national interest. The  others are governments at the level of provinces or states that look after much of the day-to-day administering of their state. Both these levels of governments enjoy their power independent of the other. \nChapter 2.indd   14 08-04-2022   12:30:50\nReprint 2025-26\n\nFederalism15\n7 The federal system thus has dual \nobjectives: to safeguard and promote \nunity of the country, while at the same time accommodate regional diversity. Therefore, two aspects are crucial for the institutions and practice of federalism. Governments at different levels should agree to some rules of power-sharing. They should also trust that each would abide by its part of the agreement. An ideal federal system has both aspects : mutual trust and agreement to live together. \nThe exact balance of power \nbetween the central and the state government varies from one federation to another.  This balance depends mainly on the historical context in which the federation was formed. There are two kinds of routes through which federations have been formed. The first route involves independent States coming together on their own to form a bigger unit, so that by pooling sovereignty and retaining identity, they can increase their security. This type of ‘coming \ntogether’ federations include the \nUSA, Switzerland and Australia. In this first category of federations, all the constituent States usually have equal power and are strong vis-à-vis the federal government.\nThe second route is where a \nlarge country decides to divide its power between the constituent States and the national government. India, Spain and Belgium are examples of this kind of ‘holding together’ federations. In this second \ncategory, the Central Government tends to be more powerful vis-à-vis the States. Very often different constituent units of the federation have unequal powers. Some units are granted special powers.\nIf federalism \nworks only in big countries, why did Belgium adopt it?\nJurisdiction: The \narea over which someone has legal authority. The area may be defined in terms of geographical boundaries or in terms of certain kinds of subjects.\nIn this sense, federations are \ncontrasted with unitary governments. Under the unitary system, either there is only one level of government or the sub-units are subordinate to the central government. The central government can pass on orders to the provincial or the local government. But in a federal system, the central government cannot order the state government to do something. State government has powers of its own for which it is not answerable to the central government. Both these governments are separately answerable to the people.\nLet us look at some of the key \nfeatures of federalism : \n1 There are two or more levels (or \ntiers) of government.\n2 Different tiers of government \ngovern the same citizens, but each tier \nhas its own jurisdiction  \nin specific matters of legislation, taxation and administration. \n3 The j urisdictions of the respective \nlevels or tiers of government are specified in the constitution. So the existence and authority of each tier of government is constitutionally guaranteed. \n4 The fundamental provisions \nof the constitution cannot \nbe \nunilaterally changed by one level of government. Such changes require the consent of both the levels of government.\n5 Courts have the power to \ninterpret \nthe constitution and \nthe powers of different levels of government. The highest court acts as an umpire if disputes arise  \nbetween different levels of government in the exercise of their respective powers.\n6 Sources of revenue for each level \nof \ngovernment are clearly specified \nto ensure its financial autonomy. \nChapter 2.indd   15 08-04-2022   12:30:50\nReprint 2025-26\n\n16\nDemocratic Politics\nIsn’t that \nstrange? Did our constitution makers not know about federalism? Or did they wish to avoid talking about it? Some Nepalese citizens were discussing the proposals on the \nadoption of federalism in their new constitution. This is what some of \nthem said:\nKhag Raj : I don’t like federalism. It would lead to reservation of seats for \ndifferent caste groups as in India. Sarita :  Ours in not a very big country. We don’t need federalism.\nBabu Lal : I am hopeful that the Terai areas will get more autonomy if they get \ntheir own state government.Ram Ganesh : I like federalism because it will mean that powers that were earlier \nenjoyed by the king will now be exercised by our elected representatives.\nIf you were participating in this conversation, what would be your response to each \nof these? Which of these reflect a wrong understanding of what feder alism is?\nWhat makes India a federal country?\nWe have earlier seen how small \ncountries like Belgium and Sri Lanka face so many problems of managing diversity. What about a vast country like India, with so many languages, religions and regions? What are the power sharing arrangements in  \nour country?\nLet us begin with the Constitution. \nIndia had emerged as an independent nation after a painful and bloody partition. Soon after Independence, several princely states became a part of the country. The Constitution declared India as a Union of States. Although it did not use the word federation, the Indian Union is based on the principles of federalism. \nLet us go back to the seven \nfeatures of federalism mentioned above. We can see that all these features apply to the provisions of the Indian Constitution. The Constitution originally provided for a two-tier system of government, the Union Government or what we call the Central Government, representing the Union of India and the State governments. Later, a third tier of federalism was added in the form of Panchayats and Municipalities. As in any federation, these different tiers enjoy separate jurisdiction.  The Constitution clearly provided a three-fold distribution of legislative powers between the Union Government and the State Governments. Thus, it contains three lists: \n\n Union List inclu\ndes subjects \nof national importance, such as \ndefence of the country, foreign affairs, banking, communications and currency. They are included in this list because we need a uniform policy on these matters throughout the country. The Union Government alone can make laws relating to the subjects mentioned in the Union\n List.\n State List contains subj\nects \nof State and local importance, such as police, trade, commerce, agriculture and irrigation. The State Governments alone can make laws relating to the subjects mentioned in the State List.\n\n Concurrent List inclu\ndes \nsubjects of common interest to \nboth the Union Government as well as the State Governments, such What makes India a federal country?\nChapter 2.indd   16 08-04-2022   12:30:52\nReprint 2025-26\n\nFederalism17\nas education, forest, trade unions, \nmarriage, adoption and succession. Both the Union as well as the State Governments can make laws on the subjects mentioned in this list. If their laws conflict with each other, the law made by the Union Government will prevail. \nWhat about subjects that do not \nfall in any of the three lists? Or subjects like computer software that came up after the constitution was made?  According to our constitution, the Union Government has the power to legislate on these ‘residuary’ subjects. \nWe noted above that most \nfederations that are formed by ‘holding together’ do not give equal power to its constituent units. Thus, all States in the Indian Union do not have identical powers. Some States enjoy a special status. States such as Assam, Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh and Mizoram enjoy special powers under certain provisions of the Constitution of India (Article 371) due to their peculiar social and historical circumstances. These special powers are especially enjoyed in relation to the protection of land rights of indigenous peoples, their culture and also preferential employment in government services.  Indians who are not permanent residents of this State cannot buy land or house here. Similar special provisions exist for some other States of India as well.\nListen to one national and one regional news bulletin broadcast by All India \nRadio daily for one week. Make a list of news items related to government \npolicies or decisions by classifying these into the following categories:\n News items that relate only to the Central Go\nvernment,\n News items that relate only to your or an\ny other State Government,\n News items about the relationship between the Centr\nal and State Governments.There are some units of the \nIndian Union which enjoy very little \npower. These are areas which are too small to become an independent State but which could not be merged with any of the existing States. These areas, like Chandigarh, or Lakshadweep or the capital city of Delhi, are called Union Territories. These territories do not have the powers of a State. The Central Government has special powers in running these areas.\nThis sharing of power between \nthe Union Government and the State Governments is basic to the structure of the Constitution. It is not easy to make changes to this power sharing arrangement. The Parliament cannot on its own change this arrangement.  Any change to it has to be first passed by both the Houses of Parliament with at least two-thirds majority. Then it has to be ratified by the legislatures of at least half of the total States. \nThe judiciary plays an important \nrole in overseeing the implementation of constitutional provisions and procedures. In case of any dispute about the division of powers, the High Courts and the Supreme Court make a decision. The Union and State Governments have the power to raise resources by levying taxes in order to carry on the government and the responsibilities assigned to each of them. \nIf agriculture and \ncommerce are state subjects, why do we have ministers of agriculture and commerce in the Union cabinet?\nChapter 2.indd   17 08-04-2022   12:30:53\nReprint 2025-26\n\n18\nDemocratic Politics\n\t Pokharan, the place where India conducted its nuclear tests, lies \nin Rajasthan.

But the Union Government does not like the style and content of the new textbooks. In that case, does the state government need to take permission from the Union Government before these textbooks can be launched?\n\tSuppose the Chief Ministers of Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Orissa have different policies on how their state police should respond to the naxalites.

If the federal experiment has succeeded in India, it is not merely because of the clearly laid out constitutional provisions. The real success of federalism in India can be attributed to the nature of democratic politics in our country. This ensured that the spirit of federalism, respect for diversity and desire for living together became shared ideals in our country. Let us look at some of the major ways in which this happened.\nLinguistic States\nThe creation of linguistic States was the first and a major test for democratic politics in our country.  If you look at the political map of \nIndia when it began its journey as a democracy in 1947 and that of 2019, you will be surprised by the extent of the changes. Many old States have vanished and many new States have been created. Areas, boundaries and names of the States have been changed. \nIn 1947, the boundaries of several \nold States of India were changed in order to create new States. This was done to ensure that people who spoke the same language lived in the same State. Some States were created not on the basis of language but to recognise differences based on culture, ethnicity or geography. These include States like Nagaland, Uttarakhand and Jharkhand.\n\tHas your village  / town  / city \nremained under the same State \nsince Independence? If not, what was the name of the earlier State?\n\tCan you identify names of three States in 1947 that have been changed later?\n\tIdentify any three States which have been carved out of  bigger States.How is federalism practised? \nChapter 2.indd   19 08-04-2022   12:31:02\nReprint 2025-26\n\n20\nDemocratic PoliticsWhen the demand for the \nformation of States on the basis of \nlanguage was raised, some national leaders feared that it would lead to the disintegration of the country. The Central Government resisted linguistic States for some time. But the experience has shown that the formation of linguistic States has actually made the country more united. It has also made administration easier.\nLanguage policy\nA second test for Indian federation is the language policy. Our Constitution did not give the status of national language to any one language. Hindi was identified as the official language. But Hindi is the mother tongue of only about 40 per cent of Indians. Therefore, there were many safeguards to protect other languages. Besides Hindi, there are 22 other languages recognised as Scheduled Languages by the Constitution. A candidate in an examination conducted for the Central Government positions may opt to take the examination in any of these languages. States too have their own official languages. Much of the government work takes place in the official language of the  \nconcerned State. \nUnlike Sri Lanka, the leaders \nof our country adopted a very cautious attitude in spreading the use of Hindi. According to the Constitution, the use of English for official purposes was to stop in 1965. However, many non-Hindi speaking States demanded that the use of English  continue. In Tamil Nadu, this movement took a violent form. The Central Government responded by agreeing to continue the use of English along with Hindi for official purposes. Many critics think that this solution favoured the English-speaking elite. Promotion of Hindi continues to be the official policy of the Government of India. Promotion does not mean that the Central Government can impose Hindi on States where people speak a different language. The flexibility shown by Indian political leaders helped our country avoid the kind of situation that Sri Lanka finds itself in. \nCentre-State relations\nRestructuring the Centre-State relations is one more way in which federalism has been strengthened in practice. How the constitutional arrangements for sharing power work in reality depends to a large extent on how the ruling parties and leaders follow these arrangements. For a long time, the same party ruled both at the Centre and in most of the States. This meant that the State Governments did not exercise their rights as autonomous federal units. As and when the ruling party at the State level was different, the parties that ruled at the Centre tried to undermine the power of the States.  In those days, the Central Government would often misuse the Constitution to dismiss the State Governments that were controlled by rival parties. This undermined the spirit of federalism. \nAll this changed significantly \nafter 1990. This period saw the rise of regional political parties in many States of the country. This was also the beginning of the era of \ncoalition  governments  at the \nCentre. Since no single party got a clear majority in the Lok Sabha, the major national parties had to enter into an alliance with many parties including several regional parties to form a government at the Centre.  \nCoalition government:  \nA government formed \nby the coming together of at least two political parties. Usually partners in a coalition form a political alliance and adopt a common programme.\nWhy Hindi? \nWhy not Bangla or Telugu?\nChapter 2.indd   20 19/03/2024   10:40:43\nReprint 2025-26\n\nFederalism21\nHere are two cartoons showing the relationship between Centre and States.

Are you serious?The States Plead for More Powers\n© Kutty - Laughing with Kutty© Ajith Ninan - India Today Book of CartoonsPerils of Running a Coalition Government\nThis led to a new culture of \npower sharing and respect for the autonomy of State Governments. This trend was supported by a major judgement of the Supreme Court that made it difficult for the Central Government to dismiss state governments in an arbitrary manner. Thus, federal power sharing is more effective today than it was in the early years after the Constitution came into force.\nChapter 2.indd   21 08-04-2022   12:31:05\nReprint 2025-26\n\n22\nDemocratic PoliticsLinguistic diversity of India\nHow many languages do we have \nin India? The answer depends on how one counts it. The latest information that we have is from the Census of India held in 2011. This census recorded more than 1300 distinct languages which people mentioned as their mother tongues. These languages were grouped together under some major languages. For example, languages like Bhojpuri, Magadhi, Bundelkhandi, Chhattisgarhi, Rajasthani and many others were grouped together under ‘Hindi’.  Even after this grouping, the Census found 121 major languages. Of these, 22 languages are now included in the Eighth Schedule of the Indian Constitution and are therefore called ‘Scheduled Languages’. Others are called  ‘non-Scheduled Languages’. In terms of languages, India is  perhaps the most diverse country  in the world.\nA look at the enclosed table \nmakes it clear that no one \nlanguage is the mother tongue of the majority of our population.  The largest language, Hindi, is the mother tongue of only about 44  per cent Indians. If we add to that all those who knew Hindi as their second or third language, the total number was still less than 50 per cent in 2011. As for English, only 0.02 per cent Indians recorded it as their mother tongue. Another 11 per cent knew it as a second or third language. \nRead this table carefully, but \nyou need not memorise it.

We have so far discussed the two-tiers of government in our country. But a vast country like India cannot be run only through these  \ntwo-tiers. States in India are as large as independent countries of Europe. In terms of population, Uttar Pradesh is bigger than Russia, Maharashtra is about as big as Germany. Many of these States are internally very diverse. There is thus a need for power sharing within these States. Federal power sharing in India needs another tier of  government, below that of the State governments. This is the rationale for decentralisation of power. Thus, resulted a third-tier of government, called local government. \nWhen power is taken away from \nCentral and State governments and given to local government, it is called decentralisation. The basic idea behind decentralisation is that there are a large number of problems and issues which are best settled at the local level. People have better knowledge of problems in their localities. They also have better ideas on where to spend money and how to manage things more efficiently. Besides, at the local level it is possible for the people to directly participate in decision making. This helps to inculcate a habit of democratic participation. Local government is the best way to realise  one  important principle of democracy, namely local self-government.\nThe need for decentralisation \nwas recognised in our Constitution. Since then, there have been several attempts to decentralise \nSo, we are like a \nthree-tier coach in a train! I always prefer the lower berth! power to the level of villages and \ntowns. Panchayats in villages and municipalities in urban areas were set up in all the States. But these were directly under the control of state governments. Elections to these local governments were not held regularly. Local governments did not have any powers or resources of their own. Thus, there was very little decentralisation in effective\n terms. \nA major step towards decentra-\nl\nisation was taken in 1992. The \nConstitution was amended to make the third-tier of democracy more powerful and effective. \n\n Now it is constitutionally\n \nmandatory to hold regular elections \nto local government bodies. \n Seats are reserved in the elected \nbodies and the \nexecutive heads of \nthese institutions for the Scheduled \nCastes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes. \n\n At le\nast one-third of all positions \nare reserved for women. \n An independent \ninstitution \ncalled the State Election Commission \nhas been created in each State to conduct panchayat and municipal elections. \n\n The State govern\nments are \nrequired to share some powers and \nrevenue with local government bodies. The nature of sharing varies from State to State. \nRural local government is \npopularly known by the name panchayati raj. Each village, or a group of villages in some States, has a gram panchayat. This is a council consisting of several ward members, often called panch, and a president or sarpanch. They are directly Decentralisation in India\nChapter 2.indd   24 08-04-2022   12:31:16\nReprint 2025-26\n\nFederalism25\nelected by all the adult population \nliving in that ward or village. It is the decision-making body for the entire village. The panchayat works under the overall supervision of the gram sabha. All the voters in the village are its members. It has to meet at least twice or thrice in a year to approve the annual budget of the gram panchayat and to review the performance of the gram panchayat. \nThe local government structure \ngoes right up to the district level. A few gram panchayats are grouped together to form what is usually called a panchayat samiti or block or mandal. The members of this representative body are elected by all the panchyat members in that area. All the panchayat samitis or mandals in a district together constitute the zilla (district) parishad. Most members of the zilla parishad are elected. Members of the Lok Sabha and MLAs of that district and some other officials of other district level bodies are also its members. Zilla parishad chairperson is the political head of the zilla parishad. \nSimilarly, local government \nbodies exist for urban areas as well. Municipalities are set up in towns. Big cities are constituted into municipal corporations. Both municipalities and municipal corporations are controlled by elected bodies consisting of people’s representatives. Municipal chairperson is the political head of the municipality. In a municipal corporation, such an officer is called the mayor.\nPrime Minister \nruns the country. Chief Minister runs the state. Logically, then, the chairperson of Zilla Parishad should run the district. Why does the D.M. or Collector administer the district?\nWhat do these newspaper clippings have to say about efforts of decentralisation in India?\nChapter 2.indd   25 08-04-2022   12:31:18\nReprint 2025-26\n\n26\nDemocratic Politics\nThis new system of local \ngovernment is the largest experiment \nin democracy conducted anywhere in the world. There are now about 36 lakh elected representatives in the panchayats and municipalities etc., all over the country. This number is bigger than the population of many countries in the world.  Constitutional status for local government has helped to deepen democracy in our country. It has also increased women’s representation and voice in our democracy. At the same time, there are many difficulties. While elections are held regularly and enthusiastically, gram sabhas are not held regularly. Most state governments have not transferred significant powers to the local governments. Nor have they given adequate resources. We are thus still a long way from realising the ideal of self-government.\nFind out about the local government in the village or town you live in. \nIf you live in a village, find out the names of the following: your panch or \nward member, your sarpanch, your panchayat samiti, the chairperson of your zilla \nparishad. Also find out when did the last meeting of the gram sabha take place and how many people took part in that.\nIf you live in urban areas, find out the name of your municipal councillor, and the \nmunicipal chairperson or mayor. Also find out about the budget of your municipal corporation, municipality and the major items on which money was spent.+ An experiment in Brazil\nA city called Porto Alegre in Brazil has carried out an extraordinary  experiment \nin combining decentralisation with participative democracy. The city has set up a parallel organisation operating alongside the municipal council, enabling local inhabitants to take real decisions for their city. The nearly 13 lakh people in this city get to participate in making the budget for their own city. The city is divided into many sectors or what we call wards. Each sector has a meeting, like that of the gram sabha, in which anyone living in that area can participate. There are some meetings to discuss issues that affect the entire city. Any citizen of the city can participate in those meetings. The budget of the city is discussed in these meetings. The proposals are put to the municipality that takes a final decision about it.\nAbout 20,000 people participate in this decision making exercise every year. \nThis method has ensured that the money cannot be spent only for the benefit of the colonies where rich people live. Buses now run to the poor colonies and builders cannot evict slum-dwellers without resettling them. \nIn our own country, a similar experiment has taken place in some areas in \nKerala. Ordinary people have participated in making a plan for the development of their locality.\nChapter 2.indd   26 08-04-2022   12:31:19\nReprint 2025-26\n\nFederalism27\nExercises1.
