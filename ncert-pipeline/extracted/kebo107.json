For example,\nour heart consists of all the four types of tissues, i.e., epithelial, connective,\nmuscular and neural. W e also notice, after some car eful study that the\ncomplexity in organ and organ systems displays certain discernable trend.\nThis discer nable tr end is called evolutionary tr end (Y ou will study the\ndetails in class XII). In this chapter , you ar e being intr oduced to\nmorphology and anatomy of frog. Morphology refers to study of form or\nexternally visible features. In the case of plants or microbes, the term\nmorphology precisely means only this. In case of animals this refers to\nthe external appearance of the organs or parts of the body. The word\nanatomy conventionally is used for the study of morphology of internal\norgans in the animals. Y ou will lear n the morphology and anatomy of\nfrog representing vertebrates.\n7.2FROGS\nFrogs can live both on land and in freshwater and belong to class Amphibia\nof phylum Chordata. The most common species of frog found in India is\nRana tigrina.\nThey do not have constant body temperature i.e., their body\ntemperature varies with the temperature of the environment. Such animals\nare called cold blooded or poikilother ms. Y ou might have also noticed\nchanges in the colour of the frogs while they are in grasses and on dry\nland. They have the ability to change the colour to hide them from their\nenemies (camouflage). This pr\notective coloration is called mimicry.  Y ou\nmay also know that fr ogs ar e not seen during peak summer and winter .\nDuring this period they take shelter in deep burrows to protect them\nfrom extreme heat and cold. This is known as summer sleep (aestivation)\nand winter sleep (hibernation) respectively.\n7.2.1 Morphology\nHave you ever touched the skin of frog? The skin is smooth and slippery\ndue to the presence of mucus. The skin is always maintained in a moist\ncondition. The colour of dorsal side of body is\ngenerally olive green with dark irregular spots.  On\nthe ventral side the skin is uniformly pale yellow.\nThe frog never drinks water but absorb it through\nthe skin.\nBody of a frog is divisible into head and trunk\n(Figure 7.1). A neck and tail are absent. Above the\nmouth, a pair of nostrils is present.  Eyes are bulged\nand covered by a nictitating membrane that\nprotects them while in water . On either side of eyes\na membranous tympanum (ear) receives sound\nsignals. The forelimbs and hind limbs help in\nFigure 7.1  External features of frogEye\nFore limb\nHind limbHeadTrunk\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSTRUCTURAL  ORGANISATION  IN ANIMALS 81\nswimming, walking, leaping and burrowing. The hind limbs end in five\ndigits and they are larger and muscular than fore limbs that end in four\ndigits. Feet have webbed digits that help in swimming. Frogs exhibit sexual\ndimorphism. Male frogs can be distinguished by the presence of sound\nproducing vocal sacs and also a copulatory pad on the first digit of the\nfore limbs which are absent in female frogs.\n7.2.2 Anatomy\nThe body cavity of frogs accommodate different organ systems such as\ndigestive, circulatory, respiratory, nervous, excretory and reproductive\nsystems with well developed structures and functions  (Figure 7.2).\nThe digestive system consists of alimentary canal and digestive glands.\nThe alimentary canal is short because frogs are carnivores and hence the\nlength of intestine is reduced. The mouth opens into the buccal cavity that\nleads to the oesophagus through pharynx. Oesophagus is a short tube\nthat opens into the stomach which in turn continues as the intestine, rectum\nand finally opens outside by the cloaca.  Liver secretes bile that is stored in\nthe gall bladder . Pancr eas, a digestive gland pr oduces pancr eatic juice\nFigure 7.2 Diagrammatic representation of internal organs of frog showing\ncomplete digestive systemIntestine Ureter\nRectum\nCloacaUrinary\nbladderOesophagus\nLiver\nStomach\nKidneyGall\nbladder\nFat bodiesLungHeart\nCloacal Aperture\nReprint 2025-26\n\n82 BIOLOGY\ncontaining digestive enzymes. Food is captured by the bilobed tongue.\nDigestion of food takes place by the action of HCl and gastric juices secreted\nfrom  the walls of the stomach. Partially digested food called chyme is passed\nfrom stomach to the first part of the small intestine, the duodenum. The\nduodenum receives bile from gall bladder and pancreatic juices from the\npancreas through a common bile duct. Bile emulsifies fat and pancreatic\njuices digest carbohydrates and proteins. Final digestion takes place in the\nintestine. Digested food is absorbed by the numer ous finger -like folds in\nthe inner wall of intestine called villi and microvilli. The undigested solid\nwaste moves into the rectum and passes out through cloaca.\nFrogs respire on land and in the water by two different methods. In\nwater , skin acts as aquatic r espiratory or gan (cutaneous r\nespiration).\nDissolved oxygen in the water is exchanged through the skin by diffusion.\nOn land, the buccal cavity, skin and lungs act as the respiratory organs.\nThe respiration by lungs is called pulmonary respiration. The lungs are a\npair of elongated, pink coloured sac-like structures present in the upper\npart of the trunk region (thorax). Air enters through the nostrils into the\nbuccal cavity and then to lungs. During aestivation and hibernation\ngaseous exchange takes place through skin.\nThe vascular system of frog is well-developed closed type. Frogs have\na lymphatic system also. The blood vascular system involves heart, blood\nvessels and blood. The lymphatic system consists of lymph, lymph\nchannels and lymph nodes. Heart is a muscular structure situated in the\nupper part of the body cavity. It has three chambers, two atria and one\nventricle and is covered by a membrane called pericardium. A triangular\nstructure called sinus venosus joins the right atrium. It receives blood\nthrough the major veins called vena cava. The ventricle opens into a sac-\nlike conus arteriosus on the ventral side of the heart. The blood from the\nheart is carried to all parts of the body by the arteries (arterial system).\nThe veins collect blood from different parts of body to the heart and form\nthe venous system. Special venous connection between liver and intestine\nas well as the kidney and lower parts of the body are present in frogs. The\nformer is called hepatic portal system and the latter is called renal portal\nsystem. The blood is composed of plasma and cells. The blood cells are\nRBC (red blood cells) or erythrocytes, WBC (white blood cells) or leucocytes\nand platelets. RBC’s are nucleated and contain red coloured pigment\nnamely haemoglobin. The lymph is different from blood. It lacks few\nproteins and RBCs. The blood carries nutrients, gases and water to the\nrespective sites during the circulation. The circulation of blood is achieved\nby the pumping action of the muscular heart.\nThe elimination of nitrogenous wastes is carried out by a well\ndeveloped excretory system. The excretory system consists of a pair of\nkidneys, ureters, cloaca and urinary bladder . These are compact, dark\nred and bean like structures situated a little posteriorly in the body cavity\non both sides of vertebral column. Each kidney is composed of several\nstructural and functional units called uriniferous tubules or nephrons.\nTwo ureters emerge from the kidneys in the male frogs. The ureters act as\nurinogenital duct which opens into the cloaca. In females the ureters and\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSTRUCTURAL  ORGANISATION  IN ANIMALS 83\noviduct open seperately in the cloaca. The thin-walled urinary bladder is\npresent ventral to the rectum which also opens in the cloaca. The frog\nexcretes urea and thus is a ureotelic  animal. Excretory wastes are carried\nby blood into the kidney where it is separated and excreted.\nThe system for control and coordination is highly evolved in the frog. It\nincludes both neural system and endocrine glands. The chemical\ncoordination of various organs of the body is\nachieved by hormones which are secreted by the\nendocrine glands. The prominent endocrine\nglands found in frog are pituitary, thyroid,\nparathyroid, thymus, pineal body, pancreatic\nislets, adrenals and gonads. The nervous system\nis organised into a central nervous system (brain\nand spinal cord), a peripheral nervous system\n(cranial and spinal nerves) and an autonomic\nnervous system (sympathetic and\nparasympathetic). There are ten pairs of cranial\nnerves arising from the brain. Brain is enclosed\nin a bony structure called brain box (cranium).\nThe brain is divided into fore-brain, mid-brain\nand hind-brain. Forebrain includes olfactory\nlobes, paired cerebral hemispheres and unpaired\ndiencephalon. The midbrain is characterised by\na pair of optic lobes. Hind-brain consists of\ncerebellum and medulla oblongata. The medulla\noblongata passes out through the foramen\nmagnum and continues into spinal cord, which\nis enclosed in the vertebral column.\nFrog has different types of sense organs, namely\norgans of touch (sensory papillae), taste (taste\nbuds), smell (nasal epithelium), vision (eyes) and\nhearing (tympanum with internal ears). Out of\nthese, eyes and internal ears are well-organised\nstructures and the rest are cellular aggregations\naround nerve endings. Eyes in a frog are a pair of\nspherical structures situated in the orbit in skull.\nThese are simple eyes (possessing only one unit).\nExternal ear is absent in frogs and only tympanum\ncan be seen externally. The ear is an organ of\nhearing as well as balancing (equilibrium).\nFrogs have well organised male and female\nreproductive systems. Male reproductive organs\nconsist of a pair of yellowish ovoid testes (Figure\n7.3), which are found adhered to the upper part\nof kidneys by a double fold of peritoneum called\nmesor chium. V asa ef ferentia ar e 10-12 in\nnumber that arise from testes. They enter the\nkidneys on their side and open into Bidder’sFigure 7.3 Male reproductive system\nFat\nbodies\nKidney\nUrino\ngenital duct\nCloaca\nCloacal\napertureTestis\nAdrenal\ngland\nUrinary\nbladderRectumVasa\nefferentia\nFigure 7.4 Female reproductive systemOviduct\nOvary\nOva\nUreter\nCloaca\nCloacal aperture\nUrinary\nbladder\nReprint 2025-26\n\n84 BIOLOGY\ncanal. Finally it communicates with the urinogenital duct that comes out\nof the kidneys and opens into the cloaca. The cloaca is a small, median\nchamber that is used to pass faecal matter , urine and sper ms to the exterior .\nThe female reproductive organs include a pair of ovaries (Figure 7.4).\nThe ovaries are situated near kidneys and there is no functional connection\nwith kidneys. A pair of oviduct arising from the ovaries opens into the\ncloaca separately. A mature female can lay 2500 to 3000 ova at a time.\nFertilisation is exter nal and takes place in water . Development involves a\nlarval stage called tadpole. Tadpole undergoes metamorphosis to form\nthe adult.\nFrogs are beneficial for mankind because they eat insects and protect\nthe crop. Frogs maintain ecological balance because these serve as an\nimportant link of food chain and food web in the ecosystem. In some\ncountries the muscular legs of frog are used as food by man.\nSUMMARY\nCells, tissues, organs and organ systems split up the work in a way that\nensur es the survival of the body as a whole and exhibit division of labour .\nA tissue is defined as group of cells along with intercellular substances\nperforming one or more functions in the body. Epithelia are sheet like\ntissues lining the body’s surface and its cavities, ducts and tubes. Epithelia\nhave one free surface facing a body fluid or the outside environment.\nTheir cells are structurally and functionally connected at junctions.\nThe Indian bullfrog, Rana tigrina, is the common frog found in India.\nBody is covered by skin. Mucous glands are present in the skin which is\nhighly vascularised and helps in respiration in water and on land. Body is\ndivisible into head and trunk. A muscular tongue is present, which is bilobed\nat the tip and is used in capturing the prey. The alimentary canal consists\nof oesophagous, stomach, intestine and rectum, which open into the cloaca.\nThe main digestive glands are liver and pancreas. It can respire in water\nthrough skin and through lungs on land. Circulatory system is closed\nwith single circulation. RBCs are nucleated. Nervous system is organised\ninto central, peripheral and autonomic. The organs of urinogenital system\nare kidneys and urinogenital ducts, which open into the cloaca. The male\nreproductive organ is a pair of testes. The female reproductive organ is a\npair of ovaries. A female lays 2500-3000 ova at a time. The fertilisation and\ndevelopment are external. The eggs hatch into tadpoles, which\nmetamorphose into frogs.\nEXERCISES\n1.Draw a neat diagram of digestive system of frog.\n2.Mention the function of the Ureters in frog.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n",
