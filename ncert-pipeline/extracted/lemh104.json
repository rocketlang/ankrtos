If M is the set of square matrices, K is the set of\nnumbers (real or complex) and f : M →  K is defined by f(A) = k, where A\n ∈ M and\nk ∈ K, then f(A) is called the determinant of A.

The arrangement of rods was precisely\nthat of the numbers in a determinant. The Chinese, therefore, early developed the\nidea of subtracting columns and rows as in simplification of a determinant\nMikami, China, pp 30, 93.\nSeki Kowa, the greatest of the Japanese Mathematicians of seventeenth\ncentury in his work ‘ Kai Fukudai no Ho ’ in 1683 showed that he had the idea of\ndeterminants and of their expansion. But he used this device only in eliminating a\nquantity from two equations and not directly in the solution of a set of simultaneous\nlinear equations. T. Hayashi, “ The Fakudoi and Determinants in Japanese\nMathematics ,” in the proc. of the Tokyo Math. Soc., V\n.\nVendermonde was the first to recognise determinants as independent functions.\nHe may be called the formal founder . Laplace (1772), gave general method of\nexpanding a determinant in terms of its complementary minors. In 1773 Lagrange\ntreated determinants of the second and third orders and used them for purpose\nother than the solution of equations. In 1801, Gauss used determinants in his\ntheory of numbers.\nThe next great contributor was Jacques - Philippe - Marie Binet, (1812) who\nstated the theorem relating to the product of two matrices of m-columns and n-\nrows, which for the special case of m = n reduces to the multiplication theorem.\nAlso on the same day , Cauchy (1812) presented one on the same subject. He\nused the word ‘determinant’ in its present sense. He gave the proof of multiplication\ntheorem more satisfactory than Binet’ s.\nThe greatest contributor to the theory was Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi, after\nthis the word determinant received its final acceptance.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n",
