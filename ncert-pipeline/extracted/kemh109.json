If slope of the line is m, show that\nk – y1 = m (h – x1).\n9.3   Various Forms  of the Equation of a Line\nWe know that every line in a plane contains infinitely many points on it. This relationship\nbetween line and points leads us to find the solution of the following problem:\nHow can we say that a given point lies on the given line? Its answer may be that\nfor a given line we should have a definite condition on the points lying on the line.\nSuppose P  (x, y\n) is an arbitrary point in the XY -plane and L  is the given line. For the\nequation of L, we wish to construct a statement  or condition  for the point P that is\ntrue, when P is on L, otherwise false. Of course the statement is merely an algebraic\nequation involving the variables x and y . Now , we will discuss the equation of a line\nunder different conditions.\n9.3.1  Horizontal and vertical lines  If a horizontal line L is at a distance a from the x-\naxis then ordinate of every point lying on the line is either a or – a [Fig 9.8 (a)] .\nTherefore, equation of the line L is either y =  a or y = – a. Choice of sign will depend\nupon the position of the line according as the line is above or below the y-axis. Similarly ,\nthe equation of a vertical line at a distance b from the y-axis is either x = b or\nx =  – b  [Fig 9.8(b)].\nReprint 2025-26\n\n160 MATHEMA TICS\nExample 4 Find the equations of the lines\nparallel to axes and passing through\n(– 2, 3).\nSolution  Position of the lines is shown in the\nFig 9.9. The y-coordinate of every point on the\nline parallel to x-axis is 3, therefore, equation\nof the line parallel to x-axis and passing through\n(– 2, 3) is y = 3. Similarly , equation of the line\nparallel  to y-axis and passing through (– 2, 3)\nis x = – 2.\n9.3.2  Point-slope form   Suppose that\nP0 (x0, y0) is a fixed point on a non-vertical\nline L, whose slope is m. Let P\n (x, y) be an\narbitrary point on L (Fig 9.10).\nThen, by the definition, the slope of L is given\nby\n( )xxm yyxxyym0 0\n00  , i.e. , − = −−−=\n                       ...(1)\nSince the point P0 (x0 , y0) along with\nall points ( x, y) on L satisfies (1) and  no other\npoint in the plane satisfies (1). Equation (1)\nis indeed the equation for the given line L.Fig  9.8\nFig 9.10Fig  9.9\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSTRAIGHT LINES       161\nThus, the point ( x, y) lies on the line with slope m through the fixed point ( x0, y0),\nif and only if, its coordinates satisfy the equation\ny – y0 = m  (x – x0)\nExample 5\n Find the equation of the line through (– 2, 3) with slope – 4.\nSolution Here m = – 4 and given point ( x0 , y0) is ( – 2, 3).\nBy slope-intercept form formula\n(1) above, equation of the given\nline is\ny – 3 = – 4 ( x + 2) or\n4x + y + 5 = 0, which is the\nrequired equation.\n9.3.3 Two-point form  Let the\nline L passes through two given\npoints P1 (x1, y1) and P2 (x2, y2).\nLet P ( x, y) be a general point\non L (Fig 9.1 1).\nThe three points P1, P2 and P are\ncollinear , therefore, we have\nslope of P1P = slope of P1P2\ni.e.,   1 2 1 2 1\n1 1\n1 2 1 2 1oryy y y y y, y ( x ). y xxx x x x x− − −= − = −− − −\nThus, equation of the line passing through the points ( x1, y1) and ( x2, y2) is given by\n                             ) (1\n1 21 2\n1 x x\nx xy yyy −−−= − ... (2)\nExample 6  Write the equation of the line through the points (1, –1) and (3, 5).\nSolution\n Here x1 = 1, y1 = – 1, x2 = 3 and y2 = 5. Using two-point form (2) above\nfor the equation of the line, we have\n                             ( )()( )5 – –1– –1 = – 13 – 1y x\nor                        –3 x + y + 4 = 0, which is the required equation.\n9.3.4  Slope-intercept form  Sometimes a line is known to us with its slope and an\nintercept on one of the axes. We will now find equations of such lines.Fig 9.1 1\nReprint 2025-26\n\n162 MATHEMA TICS\nFig 9.12Case I  Suppose a line L with slope m cuts\nthe y-axis at a distance c from the origin\n(Fig 9.12). The distance c is called the  y-\ninter cept  of the line L. Obviously ,\ncoordinates of the point where the line meet\nthe y-axis are (0, c). Thus, L has slope m\nand passes through a fixed point (0, c).\nTherefore, by point-slope form, the equation\nof L is\n0 or y c m( x ) y mx c− = − = +\nThus, the point ( x, y) on the line with slope m and y-intercept c lies on the line if and\nonly if\ny = mx +c ...(3)\nNote that the value of c will be positive or negative  \naccording as  the intercept is made\non the positive or negative side of the y-axis, respectively .\nCase II  Suppose line L with slope m makes x- intercept d. Then equation of L is\ny = m(x – d) ... (4)\nStudents may derive this equation themselves by the same method as in Case I.\nExample 7  Write the equation of the lines for which tan θ = 21\n, where θ is the\ninclination of the line and  (i) y-intercept is 3\n2–  (ii) x-intercept is 4.\nSolution  (i) Here, slope of the line is m = tan \nθ  = 21\nand y - intercept c = – 23\n.\nTherefore, by slope-intercept form (3) above, the equation of the line is\n0 3 2 or\n23\n21= + − − = x y x y ,\nwhich is the required equation.\n(ii) Here, we have m = tan θ  = 21\nand d = 4.\nTherefore, by slope-intercept form (4) above, the equation of the line is\n0 4 2 or ) 4 (\n21= + − − = x y x y ,\nwhich is the required equation.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSTRAIGHT LINES       163\n9.3.5 Intercept - form  Suppose a line L makes x-intercept a and y-intercept b on the\naxes. Obviously L meets x-axis at the point\n(a, 0) and y-axis at the point (0, b) (Fig .9.13).\nBy two-point form of the equation of the line,\nwe have\n00 ( ) or0by x a ay bx aba−− = − = − +−,\ni.e., 1= +\nby\nax\n.\nThus, equation of the line making intercepts\na and \nb on x-and y-axis, respectively , is\n1= +\nby\nax\n...

If slope of the line is m, show that\nk – y1 = m (h – x1).\n9.3   Various Forms  of the Equation of a Line\nWe know that every line in a plane contains infinitely many points on it. This relationship\nbetween line and points leads us to find the solution of the following problem:\nHow can we say that a given point lies on the given line? Its answer may be that\nfor a given line we should have a definite condition on the points lying on the line.\nSuppose P  (x, y\n) is an arbitrary point in the XY -plane and L  is the given line. For the\nequation of L, we wish to construct a statement  or condition  for the point P that is\ntrue, when P is on L, otherwise false. Of course the statement is merely an algebraic\nequation involving the variables x and y . Now , we will discuss the equation of a line\nunder different conditions.\n9.3.1  Horizontal and vertical lines  If a horizontal line L is at a distance a from the x-\naxis then ordinate of every point lying on the line is either a or – a [Fig 9.8 (a)] .\nTherefore, equation of the line L is either y =  a or y = – a. Choice of sign will depend\nupon the position of the line according as the line is above or below the y-axis. Similarly ,\nthe equation of a vertical line at a distance b from the y-axis is either x = b or\nx =  – b  [Fig 9.8(b)].\nReprint 2025-26\n\n160 MATHEMA TICS\nExample 4 Find the equations of the lines\nparallel to axes and passing through\n(– 2, 3).\nSolution  Position of the lines is shown in the\nFig 9.9. The y-coordinate of every point on the\nline parallel to x-axis is 3, therefore, equation\nof the line parallel to x-axis and passing through\n(– 2, 3) is y = 3. Similarly , equation of the line\nparallel  to y-axis and passing through (– 2, 3)\nis x = – 2.\n9.3.2  Point-slope form   Suppose that\nP0 (x0, y0) is a fixed point on a non-vertical\nline L, whose slope is m. Let P\n (x, y) be an\narbitrary point on L (Fig 9.10).\nThen, by the definition, the slope of L is given\nby\n( )xxm yyxxyym0 0\n00  , i.e. , − = −−−=\n                       ...(1)\nSince the point P0 (x0 , y0) along with\nall points ( x, y) on L satisfies (1) and  no other\npoint in the plane satisfies (1). Equation (1)\nis indeed the equation for the given line L.Fig  9.8\nFig 9.10Fig  9.9\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSTRAIGHT LINES       161\nThus, the point ( x, y) lies on the line with slope m through the fixed point ( x0, y0),\nif and only if, its coordinates satisfy the equation\ny – y0 = m  (x – x0)\nExample 5\n Find the equation of the line through (– 2, 3) with slope – 4.\nSolution Here m = – 4 and given point ( x0 , y0) is ( – 2, 3).\nBy slope-intercept form formula\n(1) above, equation of the given\nline is\ny – 3 = – 4 ( x + 2) or\n4x + y + 5 = 0, which is the\nrequired equation.\n9.3.3 Two-point form  Let the\nline L passes through two given\npoints P1 (x1, y1) and P2 (x2, y2).\nLet P ( x, y) be a general point\non L (Fig 9.1 1).\nThe three points P1, P2 and P are\ncollinear , therefore, we have\nslope of P1P = slope of P1P2\ni.e.,   1 2 1 2 1\n1 1\n1 2 1 2 1oryy y y y y, y ( x ). y xxx x x x x− − −= − = −− − −\nThus, equation of the line passing through the points ( x1, y1) and ( x2, y2) is given by\n                             ) (1\n1 21 2\n1 x x\nx xy yyy −−−= − ... (2)\nExample 6  Write the equation of the line through the points (1, –1) and (3, 5).\nSolution\n Here x1 = 1, y1 = – 1, x2 = 3 and y2 = 5. Using two-point form (2) above\nfor the equation of the line, we have\n                             ( )()( )5 – –1– –1 = – 13 – 1y x\nor                        –3 x + y + 4 = 0, which is the required equation.\n9.3.4  Slope-intercept form  Sometimes a line is known to us with its slope and an\nintercept on one of the axes. We will now find equations of such lines.Fig 9.1 1\nReprint 2025-26\n\n162 MATHEMA TICS\nFig 9.12Case I  Suppose a line L with slope m cuts\nthe y-axis at a distance c from the origin\n(Fig 9.12). The distance c is called the  y-\ninter cept  of the line L. Obviously ,\ncoordinates of the point where the line meet\nthe y-axis are (0, c). Thus, L has slope m\nand passes through a fixed point (0, c).\nTherefore, by point-slope form, the equation\nof L is\n0 or y c m( x ) y mx c− = − = +\nThus, the point ( x, y) on the line with slope m and y-intercept c lies on the line if and\nonly if\ny = mx +c ...(3)\nNote that the value of c will be positive or negative  \naccording as  the intercept is made\non the positive or negative side of the y-axis, respectively .\nCase II  Suppose line L with slope m makes x- intercept d. Then equation of L is\ny = m(x – d) ...
