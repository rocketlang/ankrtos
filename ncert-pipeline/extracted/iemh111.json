We will now\nstudy the surface area of cone.\nSo far , we have been generating solids by stacking up congruent figures. Incidentally ,\nsuch figures are called prisms . Now let us look at another kind of solid which is not a\nprism (These kinds of solids are called pyramids. ). Let us see how we can generate\nthem.\nActivity :  Cut out a right-angled triangle ABC right angled at B. Paste a long thick\nstring along one of the perpendicular sides say AB of the triangle [see Fig. 1 1.1(a)].\nHold the string with your hands on either sides of the triangle and rotate the triangle\nabout the string a number of times. What happens? Do you recognize the shape that\nthe triangle is forming as it rotates around the string [see Fig. 1 1.1(b)]? Does it remind\nyou of the time you had eaten an ice-cream heaped into a container of that shape [see\nFig. 1 1.1 (c) and (d)]?\nFig. 1 1.1\nReprint 2025-26\n\n138 MATHEMA TICS\nThis is called a right cir cular cone . In Fig. 1 1.1(c)\nof the right circular cone, the point A is called the\nvertex, AB is called the height, BC is called the radius\nand AC is called the slant height of the cone. Here B\nwill be the centre of circular base of the cone. The\nheight, radius and slant height of the cone are usually\ndenoted by h, r and l respectively . Once again, let us\nsee what kind of cone we can not call a right circular\ncone. Here, you are (see Fig. 1 1.2)! What you see in\nthese figures are not right circular cones; because in\n(a), the line joining its vertex to the centre of its base\nis not at right angle to the base, and in (b) the base is\nnot circular .\nAs in the case of cylinder , since we will be studying only about right circular cones,\nremember that by ‘cone’  in this chapter , we shall mean a ‘right circular cone.’\nActivity :  (i) Cut out a neatly made paper cone that does not have any overlapped\npaper , straight along its side, and opening it out, to see the shape of paper that forms\nthe surface of the cone. (The line along which you cut the cone is the slant height  of\nthe cone which is represented by l). It looks like a part of a round cake.\n(ii) If you now bring the sides marked A and B at the tips together , you can see that\nthe curved portion of Fig. 1 1.3 (c) will form the circular base of the cone.\nFig. 1 1.3\n(iii) If the paper like the one in Fig. 1 1.3 (c) is now cut into hundreds of little pieces,\nalong the lines drawn from the point O, each cut portion is almost a small triangle,\nwhose height is the slant height l of the cone.\n(iv) Now the area of each triangle = 1\n2 × base of each triangle × l.\nSo, area of the entire piece of paperFig. 1 1.2\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSURF ACE AREAS AND VOLUMES 139\n=sum of the areas of all the triangles\n=1 2 31 1 1\n2 2 2b l b l b l+ + +⋯ = ( ) 1 2 31\n2l b b b + + +⋯\n=1\n2 × l × length of entire curved boundary of Fig. 1 1.3(c)\n(as b1 + b2 + b3 + . . . makes up the curved portion of the figure)\nBut the curved portion of the figure makes up the perimeter of the base of the cone\nand the circumference of the base of the cone = 2 πr, where r is the base radius of the\ncone.\nSo,Curved Surface Area of a Cone = 1\n2 × l × 2πππ ππr = π ππ ππrl\nwhere r is its base radius and l its slant height.\nNote that l2 = r2 + h2 (as can be seen from Fig. 1 1.4), by\napplying Pythagoras Theorem. Here h is the  height  of the\ncone.\nTherefore, l = 2 2r h+\nNow if the base of the cone is to be closed, then a circular piece of paper of radius r\nis also required whose area is πr2.\nSo,Total Surface Area of a Cone = π ππππrl + π\nππ ππr2 = π ππππr(l + r)\nExample 1 :  Find the curved surface area of a right circular cone whose slant height\nis 10 cm and base radius is 7 cm.\nSolution :  Curved surface area = πrl\n=22\n7 × 7 × 10 cm2\n=220 cm2\nExample 2 :  The height of a cone is 16 cm and its base radius is 12 cm. Find the\ncurved surface area and the total surface area of the cone (Use π = 3.14).\nSolution :  Here, h = 16 cm and r = 12 cm.\nSo, from l2 =h2 + r2, we have\nl =2 216 12+  cm = 20 cmFig. 1 1.4\nReprint 2025-26\n\n140 MATHEMA TICS\nSo, curved surface area =πrl\n=3.14 × 12 × 20 cm2\n=753.6 cm2\nFurther , total surface area =πrl + πr2\n=(753.6 + 3.14 × 12 × 12) cm2\n=(753.6 + 452.16) cm2\n=1205.76 cm2\nExample 3 :  A corn cob (see Fig. 1 1.5), shaped somewhat\nlike a cone, has the radius of its broadest end as 2.1 cm and\nlength (height) as 20 cm. If each 1 cm2 of the surface of the\ncob carries an average of four grains, find how many grains\nyou would find on the entire cob.\nSolution :  Since the grains of corn are found only on the curved surface of the corn\ncob, we would need to know the curved surface area of the corn cob to find the total\nnumber of grains on it. In this question, we are given the height of the cone, so we\nneed to find its slant height.\nHere, l =2 2r h+  = 2 2(2.1) 20 +  cm\n=404.41  cm = 20.1 1 cm\nTherefore, the curved surface area of the corn cob = πrl\n=22\n7 × 2.1 × 20.1 1 cm2 = 132.726 cm2 = 132.73 cm2 (approx.)\nNumber of grains of corn on 1 cm2 of the surface of the corn cob = 4\nTherefore, number of grains on the entire curved surface of the cob\n=132.73 × 4 = 530.92 = 531 (approx.)\nSo, there would be approximately 531 grains of corn on the cob.\nEXERCISE 1 1.1\nAssume π = 22\n7, unless stated otherwise.\n1.Diameter of the base of a cone is 10.5 cm and its slant height is 10 cm. Find its curved\nsurface area.\n2.Find the total surface area of a cone, if its slant height is 21 m and diameter of its base\nis 24 m.Fig. 1 1.5\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSURF ACE AREAS AND VOLUMES 141\n3.Curved surface area of a cone is 308 cm2 and its slant height is 14 cm. Find\n(i) radius of the base and (ii) total surface area of the cone.\n4.A conical tent is 10 m high and the radius of its base is 24 m. Find\n(i) slant height of the tent.\n(ii) cost of the canvas required to make the tent, if the cost of 1 m2 canvas is ` 70.\n5.What length of tarpaulin 3 m wide will be required to make conical tent of height 8 m\nand base radius 6 m? Assume that the extra length of material that will be required for\nstitching margins and wastage in cutting is approximately 20 cm (Use π = 3.14).\n6.The slant height and base diameter of a conical tomb are 25 m and 14 m respectively .\nFind the cost of white-washing its curved surface at the rate of ` 210 per 100 m2.\n7.A joker ’s cap is in the form of a right circular cone of base radius 7 cm and height\n24 cm. Find the area of the sheet required to make 10 such caps.\n8.A bus stop is barricaded from the remaining part of the road, by using 50 hollow\ncones made of recycled cardboard. Each cone has a base diameter of 40 cm and height\n1 m. If the outer side of each of the cones is to be painted and the cost of painting is\n` 12 per m2, what will be the cost of painting all these cones? (Use π = 3.14 and take\n1.04  = 1.02)\n11.2 Surface Area of a Spher e\nWhat is a sphere? Is it the same as a circle? Can you draw a circle on a paper? Yes,\nyou can, because a circle is a plane closed figure whose every point lies at a constant\ndistance (called radius ) from a fixed point, which is called the centre of the circle.\nNow if you paste a string along a diameter of a circular disc and rotate it as you had\nrotated the triangle in the previous section, you see a new solid (see Fig 1 1.6). What\ndoes it resemble? A ball? Yes. It is called a spher e.\nFig. 1 1.6\nReprint 2025-26\n\n142 MATHEMA TICS\nCan you guess what happens to the centre of the circle, when it forms a sphere on\nrotation? Of course, it becomes the centre of the sphere. So, a spher e is a thr ee\ndimensional figur e (solid figur e), which is made up of all points in the space,\nwhich lie at a constant distance called the radius, fr om a fixed point called the\ncentr e of the spher e.\nNote :  A sphere is like the surface of a ball. The word solid spher e is used for the\nsolid whose surface is a sphere.\nActivity :  Have you ever played with a top or have you at least watched someone\nplay with one? You must be aware of how a string is wound around it. Now , let us take\na rubber ball and drive a nail into it. Taking support of the nail, let us wind a string\naround the ball. When you have reached the ‘fullest’ part of the ball, use pins to keep\nthe string in place, and continue to wind the string around the remaining part of the ball,\ntill you have completely covered the ball [see Fig. 1 1.7(a)]. Mark the starting and\nfinishing points on the string, and slowly unwind the string from the surface of the ball.\nNow , ask your teacher to help you in measuring the diameter of the ball, from which\nyou easily get its radius. Then on a sheet of paper , draw four circles with radius equal\nto the radius of the ball. Start filling the circles one by one, with the string you had\nwound around the ball [see Fig. 1 1.7(b)].\nFig. 1 1.7\nWhat have you achieved in all this?\nThe string, which had completely covered the surface area of the sphere, has been\nused to completely fill the regions of four circles, all of the same radius as of the sphere.\nSo, what does that mean? This suggests that the surface area of a sphere of radius r\n= 4 times the area of a circle of radius r = 4 × ( π r2)\nSo, Surface Area of a Spher e = 4 π ππππ r2\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSURF ACE AREAS AND VOLUMES 143\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\nHow many faces do you see in the surface of a sphere? There is only one, which is\ncurved.\nNow , let us take a solid sphere, and slice it exactly ‘through\nthe middle’ with a plane that passes through its centre. What\nhappens to the sphere?\nYes, it gets divided into two equal parts (see Fig. 1 1.8)! What\nwill each half  be called? It is called a hemisphere . (Because\n‘hemi’  also means ‘half ’)\nAnd what about the surface of a hemisphere? How many faces does it have?\nTwo! There is a curved face and a flat face (base).\nThe curved surface area of a hemisphere is half the surface area of the sphere, which\nis 1\n2 of 4 πr2.\nTherefore, Curved Surface Area of a Hemispher e = 2 π ππππr2\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere of which the hemisphere is a part.\nNow taking the two faces of a hemisphere, its surface area 2 πr2 + πr2\nSo,Total Surface Area of a Hemispher e = 3 π ππππr2\nExample 4 :  Find the surface area of a sphere of radius 7 cm.\nSolution :  The surface area of a sphere of radius 7 cm would be\n4πr2 =4 × 22\n7 × 7 × 7 cm2 = 616 cm2\nExample 5 :  Find (i) the curved surface area and (ii) the total surface area of a\nhemisphere of radius 21 cm.\nSolution :  The curved surface area of a hemisphere of radius 21 cm would be\n= 2πr2 =2 × 22\n7 × 21 × 21 cm2 = 2772 cm2Fig. 1 1.8\nReprint 2025-26\n\n144 MATHEMA TICS\n(ii) the total surface area of the hemisphere would be\n3πr2 =3 × 22\n7 × 21 × 21 cm2 = 4158 cm2\nExample 6 :  The hollow sphere, in which the circus motorcyclist performs his stunts,\nhas a diameter of 7 m. Find the area available to the motorcyclist for riding.\nSolution :  Diameter of the sphere = 7 m. Therefore, radius is 3.5 m. So, the riding\nspace available for the motorcyclist is the surface area of the ‘sphere’ which is\ngiven by\n4πr2 =4 × 22\n7 × 3.5 × 3.5 m2\n=154 m2\nExample 7 :  A hemispherical dome of a building needs to be painted\n(see Fig. 1 1.9). If the circumference of the base of the dome is 17.6 m, find the cost of\npainting it, given the cost of painting is ` 5 per 100 cm2.\nSolution :  Since only the rounded surface of the dome is to be painted, we would need\nto find the curved surface area of the hemisphere to know the extent of painting that\nneeds to be done. Now , circumference of the dome = 17.6 m. Therefore, 17.6 = 2 πr.\nSo, the radius of the dome = 17.6 × 7\n2 22× m = 2.8 m\nThe curved surface area of the dome = 2 πr2\n=2 × 22\n7 × 2.8 × 2.8 m2\n=49.28 m2\nNow , cost of painting 100 cm2 is ` 5.\nSo, cost of painting 1 m2 = ` 500\nTherefore, cost of painting the whole dome\n=` 500 × 49.28\n=` 24640\nEXERCISE 1 1.2\nAssume π = 22\n7, unless stated otherwise.\n1.Find the surface area of a sphere of radius:\n(i)10.5 cm (ii)5.6 cm (iii)14 cmFig. 1 1.9\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSURF ACE AREAS AND VOLUMES 145\n2.Find the surface area of a sphere of diameter:\n(i)14 cm (ii)21 cm (iii)3.5 m\n3.Find the total surface area of a hemisphere of radius 10 cm.

Find the ratio of surface areas of the balloon in the two cases.\n5.A hemispherical bowl made of brass has inner diameter 10.5 cm.

Find\n(i)surface area of the sphere,\n(ii)curved surface area of the cylinder ,\n(iii)ratio of the areas obtained in (i) and (ii).\n11.3 Volume of a Right Cir cular  Cone\nIn earlier classes we have studied the volumes of\ncube, cuboid and cylinder\nIn Fig 1 1.11, can you see that there is a right circular\ncylinder and a right circular cone of the same base\nradius and the same height?\nActivity :  Try to make a hollow cylinder and a hollow cone like this with the same\nbase radius and the same height (see Fig. 1 1.11). Then, we can try out an experiment\nthat will help us, to see practically what the volume of a right circular cone would be!\nFig. 1 1.12Fig. 1 1.10\nFig. 1 1.11\nReprint 2025-26\n\n146 MATHEMA TICS\nSo, let us start like this.\nFill the cone up to the brim with sand once, and empty it into the cylinder . We find\nthat it fills up only a part of the cylinder [see Fig. 1 1.12(a)].\nWhen we fill up the cone again to the brim, and empty it into the cylinder , we see\nthat the cylinder is still not full [see Fig. 1 1.12(b)].\nWhen the cone is filled up for the third time, and emptied into the cylinder , it can be\nseen that the cylinder is also full to the brim [see Fig. 1 1.12(c)].\nWith this, we can safely come to the conclusion that three times the volume of a\ncone, makes up the volume of a cylinder , which has the same base radius and the\nsame height as the cone, which means that the volume of the cone is one-third the\nvolume of the cylinder .\nSo, Volume of a Cone = 1\n3π ππππr2h\nwhere r is the base radius and h is the height of the cone.\nExample 8 :  The height and the slant height of a cone are 21 cm and 28 cm respectively .\nFind the volume of the cone.\nSolution :  From l2 = r2 + h2, we have\nr =2 2 2 228 21 cm 7 7 cm l h− = − =\nSo, volume of the cone = 1\n3πr2h = 1\n3 × 227 7 7 7 217× × ×  cm3\n                                   = 7546 cm3\nExample 9 :  Monica has a piece of canvas whose area is 551 m2. She uses it to have\na conical tent made, with a base radius of 7 m. Assuming that all the stitching mar gins\nand the wastage incurred while cutting, amounts to approximately 1 m2, find the volume\nof the tent that can be made with it.\nSolution :  Since the area of the canvas = 551 m2 and area of the canvas lost in\nwastage is 1 m2, therefore the area of canvas available for making the tent is\n(551 – 1) m2 = 550 m2.\nNow , the surface area of the tent = 550 m2 and the required base radius of the conical\ntent = 7 m\nNote that a tent has only a curved surface (the floor of a tent is not covered by\ncanvas!!).\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSURF ACE AREAS AND VOLUMES 147\nTherefore, curved surface area of tent = 550 m2.\nThat is, πrl =550\nor,22\n7 × 7 × l =550\nor, l =3550\n22m = 25 m\nNow, l2 =r2 + h2\nTherefore, h = 2 2l r−  =2 225 7 m 625 49 m 576 m− = − =\n=24 m\nSo, the volume of the conical tent = 2 3 1 1 227 7 24 m3 3 7r hπ = × × × × = 1232 m3.\nEXERCISE 1 1.3\nAssume π = 22\n7, unless stated otherwise.\n1.Find the volume of the right circular cone with\n(i)radius 6 cm, height 7 cm (ii)radius 3.5 cm, height 12 cm\n2.Find the capacity in litres of a conical vessel with\n(i)radius 7 cm, slant height 25 cm (ii)height 12 cm, slant height 13 cm\n3.The height of a cone is 15 cm.

Find also the ratio of the volumes of the two\nsolids obtained in Questions 7 and 8.\n9.A heap of wheat is in the form of a cone whose diameter is 10.5 m and height is 3 m.\nFind its volume. The heap is to be covered by canvas to protect it from rain. Find the\narea of the canvas required.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n148 MATHEMA TICS\n11.4 Volume of a Spher e\nNow , let us see how to go about measuring the volume of a sphere. First, take two or\nthree spheres of different radii, and a container big enough to be able to put each of\nthe spheres into it, one at a time. Also, take a lar ge trough in which you can place the\ncontainer . Then, fill the container up to the brim with water [see Fig. 1 1.13(a)].\nNow , carefully place one of the spheres in the container . Some of the water from\nthe container will over flow into the trough in which it is kept [see Fig. 1 1.13(b)].\nCarefully pour out the water from the trough into a measuring cylinder (i.e., a graduated\ncylindrical jar) and measure the water over flowed [see Fig. 1 1.13(c)]. Suppose the\nradius of the immersed sphere is r (you can find the radius by measuring the diameter\nof the sphere). Then evaluate 4\n3 πr3. Do you find this value almost equal to the\nmeasure of the volume over flowed?\nFig. 1 1.13\nOnce again repeat the procedure done just now , with a dif ferent size of sphere.\nFind the radius R of this sphere and then calculate the value of 3 4R .3π Once again this\nvalue is nearly equal to the measure of the volume of the water displaced (over flowed)\nby the sphere. What does this tell us? We know that the volume of the sphere is the\nsame as the measure of the volume of the water displaced by it. By doing this experiment\nrepeatedly with spheres of varying radii, we are getting the same result, namely , the\nvolume of a sphere is equal to 4\n3π times the cube of its radius. This gives us the idea\nthat\nVolume of a Spher e =3 4\n3rπ\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\nLater , in higher classes it can be proved also. But at this stage, we will just take it\nas true.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nSURF ACE AREAS AND VOLUMES 149\nSince a hemisphere is half of a sphere, can you guess what the volume of a\nhemisphere will be? Yes, it is 3 1 4of2 3rπ = 2\n3πr3.\nSo, Volume of a Hemispher e =3 2\n3rπ\nwhere r is the radius of the hemisphere.\nLet us take some examples to illustrate the use of these formulae.\nExample 10 :  Find the volume of a sphere of radius 1 1.2 cm.\nSolution : Required volume =4\n3πr3\n=4 2211.2 11.2 11.23 7× × × ×  cm3 = 5887.32 cm3\nExample 1 1 : A shot-putt is a metallic sphere of radius 4.9 cm. If the density of the\nmetal is 7.8 g per cm3, find the mass of the shot-putt.\nSolution :  Since the shot-putt is a solid sphere made of metal and its mass is equal to\nthe product of its volume and density , we need to find the volume of the sphere.\nNow , volume of the sphere = 34\n3rπ\n=3 4 224.9 4.9 4.9 cm3 7× × × ×\n=493 cm3 (nearly)\nFurther , mass of 1 cm3 of metal is 7.8 g.\nTherefore, mass of the shot-putt = 7.8 × 493 g\n=3845.44 g = 3.85 kg (nearly)\nExample 12 :  A hemispherical bowl has a radius of 3.5 cm.
