Why don’t two magnetic field lines intersect each other?\nReprint 2025-26\n\nMagnetic Effects of Electric Current 201We know that the magnetic field produced by a curr ent-carrying\nwire at a given point depends directly on the current passing through it.\nTherefore, if there is a circular coil having n turns, the field produced is\nn times as large as that produced by a single turn. This is because the\ncurrent in each circular turn has the same direction, and the field due to\neach turn then just adds up.\nActivity 12.6Activity 12.6Activity 12.6Activity 12.6Activity 12.6\n/square6Take a rectangular cardboard having two holes.\nInsert a circular coil having large number of turns\nthrough them, normal to the plane of the cardboard.\n/square6Connect the ends of the coil in series with a battery,\na key and a rheostat, as shown in Fig. 12.9.\n/square6Sprinkle iron filings uniformly on the cardboard.\n/square6Plug the key.\n/square6Tap the cardboard gently a few times. Note the\npattern of the iron filings that emerges on the\ncardboard.Figure 12.9Figure 12.9Figure 12.9Figure 12.9Figure 12.9\nMagnetic field produced by a current-\ncarrying circular coil.\n12.2.4 Magnetic Field due to a Current in a Solenoid\nA coil of many circular turns of insulated copper wire wrapped\nclosely in the shape of a cylinder is called a solenoid. The pattern\nof the magnetic field lines around a current-carrying solenoid is\nshown in Fig. 12.10. Compare the pattern of the field with the\nmagnetic field around a bar magnet (Fig. 12.4). Do they look\nsimilar? Y es, they are similar . In fact, one end of the solenoid\nbehaves as a magnetic north pole, while the other behaves as the\nsouth pole. The field lines inside the solenoid are in the form of\nparallel straight lines. This indicates that the magnetic field is\nthe same at all points inside the solenoid. That is, the field is\nuniform inside the solenoid.\nA strong magnetic field produced inside a solenoid can be\nused to magnetise a piece of magnetic material, like soft iron,\nwhen placed inside the coil (Fig. 12.11). The magnet so formed is\ncalled an electromagnet.Figure 12.10Figure 12.10Figure 12.10Figure 12.10Figure 12.10\nField lines of the magnetic field\nthrough and around a current\ncarrying solenoid.\nFigure 12.11Figure 12.11Figure 12.11Figure 12.11Figure 12.11\nA current-carrying solenoid coil\nis used to magnetise steel rod\ninside it – an electromagnet.QUESTIONS\n?1. Consider a circular loop of wire lying in\nthe plane of the table. Let the current\npass through the loop clockwise. Apply\nthe right-hand rule to find out the\ndirection of the magnetic field inside\nand outside the loop.\n2. The magnetic field in a given region is\nuniform. Draw a diagram to represent it.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nScience 20212.3 12.312.312.312.3 FORCE ON A CURRENTFORCE ON A CURRENTFORCE ON A CURRENTFORCE ON A CURRENTFORCE ON A CURRENT -\n-- --CCC CCARRYING CONDUCTORARRYING CONDUCTORARRYING CONDUCTORARRYING CONDUCTORARRYING CONDUCTOR\nIN A MAGNETIC FIELDIN A MAGNETIC FIELDIN A MAGNETIC FIELDIN A MAGNETIC FIELDIN A MAGNETIC FIELD\nWe have lear nt that an electric current flowing through a conductor\nproduces a magnetic field. The field so produced exerts a force on a\nmagnet placed in the vicinity of the conductor . French scientist Andre\nMarie Ampere (1775–1836) suggested that the magnet must also exert\nan equal and opposite for ce on the curr ent-carrying conductor . The for ce\ndue to a magnetic field acting on a current-carrying conductor can be\ndemonstrated through the following activity.3. Choose the correct option.\nThe magnetic field inside a long straight solenoid-carrying current\n(a) is zero.\n(b) decreases as we move towards its end.\n(c) increases as we move towards its end.\n(d) is the same at all points.\nActivity 12.7Activity 12.7Activity 12.7Activity 12.7Activity 12.7\n/square6Take a small aluminium rod AB (of about 5 cm). Using\ntwo connecting wires suspend it horizontally from a\nstand, as shown in Fig. 12.12.\n/square6Place a strong horse-shoe magnet in such a way that\nthe rod lies between the two poles with the magnetic\nfield directed upwards. For this put the north pole of\nthe magnet vertically below and south pole vertically\nabove the aluminium rod (Fig. 12.12).\n/square6Connect the aluminium rod in series with a battery,\na key and a rheostat.\n/square6Now pass a current through the aluminium rod from\nend B to end A.\n/square6What do you observe? It is observed that the rod is\ndisplaced towar ds the left. Y ou will notice that the r od\ngets displaced.\n/square6Reverse the direction of current flowing through the\nrod and observe the direction of its displacement. It is\nnow towards the right.\nWhy does the rod get displaced?Figure 12.12Figure 12.12Figure 12.12Figure 12.12Figure 12.12\nA current-carrying rod, AB, experiences\na force perpendicular to its length and\nthe magnetic field. Support for the\nmagnet is not shown here, for simplicity.\nThe displacement of the rod in the above activity suggests that a\nforce is exerted on the current-carrying aluminium rod when it is placed\nin a magnetic field. It also suggests that the direction of force is also\nreversed when the direction of current through the conductor is reversed.\nNow change the direction of field to vertically downwards by\ninterchanging the two poles of the magnet. It is once again observed that\nReprint 2025-26\n\nMagnetic Effects of Electric Current 203the direction of force acting on the current-carrying rod gets reversed. It\nshows that the direction of the force on the conductor depends upon the\ndirection of current and the direction of the magnetic field. Experiments\nhave shown that the displacement of the rod is largest (or the magnitude\nof the force is the highest) when the direction of current is at right angles\nto the direction of the magnetic field. In such a condition we can use a\nsimple rule to find the dir ection of the for ce on the conductor .\nIn Activity 12.7, we considered the\ndirection of the current and that of the magnetic\nfield perpendicular to each other and found\nthat the force is perpendicular to both of them.\nThe three directions can be illustrated through\na simple rule, called Fleming’s left-hand rule.\nAccording to this rule, stretch the thumb,\nforefinger and middle finger of your left hand\nsuch that they are mutually perpendicular\n(Fig. 12.13). If the first finger points in the\ndirection of magnetic field and the second\nfinger in the direction of current, then the\nthumb will point in the direction of motion or\nthe for ce acting on the conductor .\nDevices that use current-carrying conductors and magnetic fields\ninclude electric motor , electric generator , loudspeakers, microphones\nand measuring instruments.\nExample 12.2\nAn electron enters a magnetic field at right angles to it, as shown\nin Fig. 12.14. The direction of force acting on the electron will be\n(a) to the right.\n(b)to the left.\n(c)out of the page.\n(d)into the page.\nSolution\nAnswer is option (d). The direction of force is perpendicular to the\ndirection of magnetic field and current as given by Fleming’s left hand\nrule. Recall that the direction of current is taken opposite to the direction\nof motion of electrons. The force is therefore directed into the page.Figure 12.13Figure 12.13Figure 12.13Figure 12.13Figure 12.13\nFleming’s left-hand rule\nFigure 12.14Figure 12.14Figure 12.14Figure 12.14Figure 12.14\nQUESTIONS\n?1.

One of the wires in this supply, usually with\nred insulation cover , is called live wir e (or positive). Another wir e, with\nblack insulation, is called neutral wire (or negative). In our country, the\npotential dif ference between the two is 220 V .\nAt the meter -boar d in the house, these wir es pass into an electricity\nmeter through a main fuse. Through the main switch they are connected\nto the line wires in the house. These wires supply electricity to separate\ncircuits within the house. Often, two separate circuits are used, one of\n15 A current rating for appliances with higher power ratings such as\ngeysers, air coolers, etc. The other circuit is of 5 A current rating for\nbulbs, fans, etc. The earth wir e, which has insulation of gr een colour , is\nusually connected to a metal plate deep in the earth near the house.\nThis is used as a safety measure, especially for those appliances that\nhave a metallic body, for example, electric press, toaster , table fan,\nrefrigerator , etc. The metallic body is connected to the earth wir e, which\nprovides a low-resistance conducting path for the current. Thus, it\nensures that any leakage of current to the metallic body of the appliance\nkeeps its potential to that of the earth, and the user may not get a severe\nelectric shock.2. In Activity 12.7, how do we think the displacement of rod AB will be\naffected if (i) current in rod AB is increased; (ii) a stronger horse-shoe\nmagnet is used; and (iii) length of the rod AB is increased?\n3. A positively-charged particle (alpha-particle) projected towards west is\ndeflected towards north by a magnetic field. The direction of magnetic\nfield is\n(a) towards south (b) towards east\n(c) downward (d) upward\nMagnetism in medicine\nAn electric current always produces a magnetic field. Even weak ion currents that\ntravel along the nerve cells in our body produce magnetic fields. When we touch\nsomething, our nerves carry an electric impulse to the muscles we need to use. This\nimpulse produces a temporary magnetic field. These fields are very weak and are\nabout one-billionth of the earth’s magnetic field. Two main organs in the human\nbody where the magnetic field produced is significant , are the heart and the brain. The\nmagnetic field inside the body forms the basis of obtaining the images of different body\nparts. This is done using a technique called Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Analysis\nof these images helps in medical diagnosis. Magnetism has, thus, got important uses\nin medicine.More to Know!\nReprint 2025-26\n\nMagnetic Effects of Electric Current 205Figure 12.15Figure 12.15Figure 12.15Figure 12.15Figure 12.15  A schematic diagram of one of the common domestic circuits\nQUESTIONS\n?Figure 12.15 gives a schematic diagram of one of the common\ndomestic circuits. In each separate circuit, different appliances can be\nconnected across the live and neutral wires. Each appliance has a\nseparate switch to ‘ON’/‘OFF’ the flow of current through it. In order\nthat each appliance has equal potential difference, they are connected\nparallel to each other .\nElectric fuse is an important component of all domestic cir cuits. W e\nhave already studied the principle and working of a fuse in the previous\nchapter (see Section 11.7). A fuse in a circuit prevents damage to the\nappliances and the circuit due to overloading. Overloading can occur\nwhen the live wire and the neutral wire come into direct contact. (This\noccurs when the insulation of wires is damaged or there is a fault in the\nappliance.) In such a situation, the current in the circuit abruptly\nincreases. This is called short-circuiting. The use of an electric fuse\nprevents the electric circuit and the appliance from a possible damage\nby stopping the flow of unduly high electric current. The Joule heating\nthat takes place in the fuse melts it to break the electric circuit.\nOverloading can also occur due to an accidental hike in the supply\nvoltage. Sometimes overloading is caused by connecting too many\nappliances to a single socket.\n1. Name two safety measures commonly used in electric circuits and\nappliances.\n2. An electric oven of 2 kW power rating is operated in a domestic electric\ncircuit (220 V) that has a current rating of 5 A. What result do you\nexpect? Explain.\n3. What precaution should be taken to avoid the overloading of domestic\nelectric circuits?\nReprint 2025-26\n\nScience 206What y ou hav e learnt\n/square6A compass needle is a small magnet. Its one end, which points towards north, is\ncalled a north pole, and the other end, which points towards south, is called a\nsouth pole.\n/square6A magnetic field exists in the region surrounding a magnet, in which the force of\nthe magnet can be detected.\n/square6Field lines are used to represent a magnetic field. A field line is the path along\nwhich a hypothetical free north pole would tend to move. The direction of the\nmagnetic field at a point is given by the direction that a north pole placed at that\npoint would take. Field lines are shown closer together where the magnetic field is\ngreater.\n/square6A metallic wire carrying an electric current has associated with it a magnetic field.\nThe field lines about the wire consist of a series of concentric circles whose direction\nis given by the right-hand rule.\n/square6The pattern of the magnetic field around a conductor due to an electric current\nflowing thr ough it depends on the shape of the conductor . The magnetic field of a\nsolenoid carrying a current is similar to that of a bar magnet.\n/square6An electromagnet consists of a core of soft iron wrapped around with a coil of\ninsulated copper wire.\n/square6A current-carrying conductor when placed in a magnetic field experiences a force.\nIf the direction of the field and that of the current are mutually perpendicular to\neach other , then the for ce acting on the conductor will be perpendicular to both\nand will be given by Fleming’s left-hand rule.\n/square6In our houses we receive AC electric power of 220 V with a frequency of 50 Hz. One\nof the wires in this supply is with red insulation, called live wire. The other one is of\nblack insulation, which is a neutral wire. The potential difference between the two\nis 220 V . The thir d is the earth wir e that has gr een insulation and this is connected\nto a metallic body deep inside earth. It is used as a safety measure to ensure that\nany leakage of curr ent to a metallic body does not give any sever e shock to a user .\n/square6Fuse is the most important safety device, used for protecting the circuits due to\nshort-circuiting or overloading of the circuits.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nMagnetic Effects of Electric Current 207EXERCISES\n1.Which of the following correctly describes the magnetic field near a long\nstraight wire?\n(a) The field consists of straight lines perpendicular to the wire.\n(b)  The field consists of straight lines parallel to the wire.\n(c) The field consists of radial lines originating from the wire.\n(d) The field consists of concentric circles centred on the wire.\n2.At the time of short circuit, the current in the circuit\n(a) reduces substantially.\n(b) does not change.\n(c) increases heavily.\n(d) vary continuously.\n3.State whether the following statements are true or false.\n(a) The field at the centre of a long circular coil carrying current will be\nparallel straight lines.\n(b) A wire with a green insulation is usually the live wire of an electric supply.\n4.List two methods of producing magnetic fields.\n5.When is the force experienced by a curren t–carrying conductor placed in a magnetic\nfield largest?\n6.Imagine that you are sitting in a chamber with your back to one wall.
