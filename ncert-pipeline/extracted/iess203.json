It provides a\nshared blueprint for peace and prosperity\nfor people and the planet, now  and into\nthe future. At its centre point are the 17\nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\nThis requires urgent action from the part\nof both the developed and the developing\ncountries (see box).\nDeveloped countries ought to support\nthe developing countries in the endeavour\nof ending poverty, improve health and\neducation, reduce inequalities, tackling\nclimate change and promote sustainable\ndevelopment.The United Nations (UN) Or ganisation,\nan international organisation works\nwith many countries to eradicate\npoverty. In collaboration with\ngovernments of member countries, UN\ncame out with 17 Sustainable\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs) to be\nachieved by 2030.  They are given in\nthe form of infographics on the next\npage. Each goal was split into various\ntargets to be achieved by the countries\nwho are members of UN. One of the\ntargets of SDG 1 is reducing the\nproportion of men, women and children\nin all ages living in poverty in all its\ndimensions at least to half by 2030 . The\ndecline in the proportion of poor reflects\nIndia’s commitment to achieve the\ntarget related to Goal 1: No Poverty (End\npoverty in all its forms everywhere).\nReprint 2025-26\n\n38  \n   Economics\nCauses of Poverty\nThere were number of causes for the\nwidespread poverty in India. One historical\nreason is the low level of economic\ndevelopment under the British colonial\nadministration. The policies of the colonial\ngovernment ruined traditional handicrafts\nand discouraged development of industries\nlike textiles. The low rate of growth persisted\nuntil the 1980s . This resulted in less job\nopportunities and low growth rate of\nincomes. This was accompanied by a high\ngrowth of population.\nWith the spread of irrigation and the\nGreen Revolution, many job opportunities were\ncreated in the agricultur e sector . But the impact\nwas limited to some parts of India. The\nindustries, both in the public and the private\nsector , did pr ovide some jobs. But these wer e\nnot enough to absorb all the job seekers.\nUnable to find jobs with better income in cities,\nmany people started working as rickshaw\npullers, vendors, construction workers,\ndomestic servants , etc. With irregular small\nincomes, these people could not afford\nreasonable shelter . They started living in slums\non the outskirts of the cities and the problemsTake the help of your teacher and\ngather the details of each SDG. Do a\nproject report on how your country/\nstate is achieving these goals.of poverty, largely a rural phenomenon also\nbecame a feature of  urban India.\nAnother feature of high poverty rates\nhas been the huge income inequalities.\nOne of the major reasons for this is the\nunequal distribution of land and other\nresources. Despite many policies, we have\nnot been able to tackle the issue of\npoverty. Major policy initiatives like land\nreforms which aimed at redistribution of\nassets in rural areas have not been\nimplemented effectively by most of the\nstate governments. Effective\nimplementation of policy could have\nimproved the life of millions of rural poor.\n Many other socio-cultural and\neconomic factors are also responsible for\npoverty. In order to fulfil social\nobligations and observe religious\nceremonies, people in India, including\nthe very poor, spend a lot of money and\nwaste their hard earned income. Small\nfarmers need money to buy agricultural\ninputs like seeds, fertilizer, pesticides,\netc. Since poor people hardly have any\nsavings, they borrow or accept loan at\nhigher risk. Unable to repay because of\npoverty, they become victims of\nindebtedness. So the high level of\nindebtedness is both the cause and effect\nof poverty.\nSource : https://sdgs.un.org/goals\nReprint 2025-26\n\n  Poverty as a Challenge\n   39\nAnti-Poverty Measures\nRemoval of poverty has been one of the\nmajor objectives of Indian developmental\nstrategy. The current anti-poverty\nstrategy of the government is based\nbroadly on two factors — (i) promotion\nof economic growth (ii) targeted anti-\npoverty programmes.\nOver a period of thirty years of\nindependent India, lasting up to the early\neighties, there were little per capita\nincome growth and not much reduction\nin poverty. Official poverty estimates\nwhich were about 45 per cent in the early\n1950s remained the same even in the\nearly eighties. Since the eighties, India’s\neconomic growth has been one of the\nfastest in the world. The growth rate\njumped from the average of about 3.5\nper cent a year in the 1970s to about 6\nper cent during the 1980s and 1990s.\nThe two decades of 21st century\n(2000–2020) has also witnessed the rapid\neconomic development. The higher\ngrowth rates have significantly helped in\nthe reduction of poverty. Therefore, it is\nbecoming clear that there is a strong link\nbetween economic growth and poverty\nreduction. Economic growth widens\nopportunities and provides the resources\nneeded to invest in human development.\nThis also encourages people to send\ntheir children, including the girl child, to\nschools in the hope of getting bettereconomic returns by investing in\neducation. The poor may not be able to\ntake advantage from the opportunities\ncreated by economic gr owth. However ,\ngrowth in the agriculture sector is much\nbelow expectations. This has a direct\nbearing on poverty. A large number of poor\npeople live in villages and are dependent\non agriculture.\nIn these circumstances, there is a clear\nneed for targeted anti-poverty\nprogrammes. Although there are many\nschemes which are formulated to affect\npoverty directly or indirectly. Some of them\nare worth mentioning.\nMahatma Gandhi National Rural\nEmployment Guarantee  Act, 2005  aims\nto provide 100 days of wage employment\nto every household to ensure livelihood\nsecurity in rural areas. It also aimed at\nsustainable development to address the\ncause of dr ought, deforestration and soil\nerosion. One-third of the proposed jobs\nhave been reserved for women under this\nact. The wage rate for unskilled manual\nworkers is revised regularly,\nPradhan Mantri Poshan Shakti\nAbhiyan (PM Poshan)  is a flagship\nprogramme of Government of India. It\nwas initiated with twin purpose — (i) to\nimprove the nutritional requirement\nespecially calorie and the protein intake\nof the child, (ii) improve the school\nenrolment and eliminate the drop out\nfrom the school. It targets students from\nClasses I to VIII in Government,\nGovernment aided schools and special\ntraining centres under the Right to\nEducation Act.\nThis scheme is implemented with the\nsupport of local governments and various\ncommunity organisations. This programme\nencourages poor children, belonging to\ndisadvantaged sections, to attend school\nmore regularly and helps them concentrate\non classroom activities.  Let’ s Discuss\nObserve some of the poor families\naround you and try to find the following:\n•Which social and economic group do\nthey belong to?\n•Who are the earning members in the\nfamily?\n•What is the condition of the old people\nin the family?\n•Are all the children (both boys and girls)\nattending schools?\nReprint 2025-26\n\n40  \n   Economics\nThe Challenges Ahead\nPoverty has certainly declined in India. But\ndespite the progress, poverty reduction\nremains India’s most compelling challenge.\nWide disparities in poverty are visible\nbetween rural and urban areas and\namong different States also. Certain social\nand economic groups are more vulnerable\nto poverty. Poverty reduction is expected\nto make better India. This would be\npossible mainly due to higher economic\ngrowth, increasing focus on universal\neducation, declining population growth;\nempowerment of the women and the\neconomically weaker sections of society\nwould also facilitate the same.\nThe income based definition of poverty\ncaptures only a limited part of what\npoverty really means to people. It is about\na ‘minimum’ subsistence level of living\nrather than a ‘reasonable’ level of living.\nMany scholars advocate that we must\nbroaden the concept into human poverty . A\nlarge number of people may have been able\nto feed themselves. But do they have\neducation? Or shelter? Or health care?\nOr job security? Or self-confidence? Are\nthey free from caste and gender\ndiscrimination? Is the practice of child\nlabour still common? Worldwide\nexperience shows that with development,\nthe definition of what constitutes poverty\nalso changes. In this chapter we have\nlooked at the different approaches to\nmeasure poverty. The National\nMultidimensional Poverty Index put\nforward by NITI Aayog reveals that the\nnumber and proportion of\nmultidimensionally poor has declined in\nIndia. This may be due to the array of\nGovernment interventions initiated in\nrecent years. What do you think?Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva\nAbhiyan was launched in 2016 with the aim\nto reduce maternal and infant mortality by\nproviding quality antenatal care to the\npregnant women throughout the country.\nThe scheme works towards  safe\npregnancies, deliveries and addresses gaps\nin the service of the maternal care, to ensure\nconstant and regular treatment to the\nbeneficiaries. Services are provided on the\nninth day of every month. This programme\nfollows a systematic approach for\nengagement with private practitioners,\nmotivating them to volunteer in the scheme\nat government health facilities.\nPradhan Mantri Ujjwala Y ojana (PMUY)\naims towards women empowerment in\nrural areas. It encourages the use of\nsmoke-free kitchen, thereby, saving them\nfrom chronic respiratory disorders and\npoor eye sights. It was launched in 2016\nwith an aim to provide clean cooking fuel\n(liquefied petroleum gas or LPG) to\neconomically poor households especially\nin the rural areas, who cook using\ntraditional methods by using either coal,\nwood or cow dungs. Its target beneficiaries\nare Below Poverty Line (BPL) households,\nScheduled Castes, Scheduled T ribes,\nforest dwellers and marginalised group\nhouseholds. To encourage the use of LPG,\nthe scheme provides a completely free\nconnection, including the first refill  and\na stove.\nOver the years there is an increase in\nthe LPG coverage throughout the country.\nConnections are issued in the name of the\nfemale member of the family. This scheme\nalso promotes environment sustainability\nby reducing deforestation and carbon\nemission generated from burning coal and\nfirewood. The use of clean cooking fuel,\ni.e., LPG means less time and effort in\ncollecting firewood and encourages women\nto participate in social and economic\nactivities.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n  Poverty as a Challenge\n   41\n  Summary\nIn this chapter , we have looked at the dif ferent appr oaches of measuring poverty. The National\nMultidimensional Poverty Index, put forward by NITI Aayog in collaboration with UNDP and Oxford\nPolicy and Human Development Initiative reveals that on the Headcount Ratio of multidimensionally\npoor, ther e has been a considerable r eduction. Even when some of the states like Kerala and T amil\nNadu have reached less than 10 per cent on the HCR front, much is yet to be achieved by the other\nstates. However , it is also to be noted that due to the array of Gover nment intervention policies\nbetween 2005–06 and 2019–21 there has been significant decline in the number of MPI poor in the\nstates of Bihar , Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.\n  Exercises\n1.How is the poverty line estimated in India?\n2.Do you think that the present methodology of poverty estimation is appropriate?\n3.Describe poverty trends in India since 1993.\n4.Discuss the major reasons for poverty in India.\n5.Identify the social and economic groups which are most vulnerable to poverty in India.\n6.Give an account of interstate disparities of poverty in India.\n7.Describe global poverty trends.\n8.Describe the role of government in reducing poverty in India?\n  9.
