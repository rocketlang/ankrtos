      "title": ".The leaves have a green pigment",
      "content": "Chapter 7.The leaves have a green pigment\ncalled chlorophyll . It helps leaves to\ncapture the energy of the sunlight. This\nenergy is used to synthesise (prepare)\nfood from carbon dioxide and water.Since the synthesis of food occurs in the\npresence of sunlight, it is called\nphotosynthesis (Photo: light; synthesis  :\nto combine). So we find that chlorophyll,\nsunlight, carbon dioxide and water are\nnecessary to carry out the process ofphotosynthesis. It is a unique process\non the earth . The solar energy is\ncaptured by the leaves and stored in the\nplant in the form of food. Thus, sun is\nthe ultimate source of energy for allliving organisms.\nCan you imagine life on earth in the\nabsence of photosynthesis!\nIn the absence of photosynthesis\nthere would not be any food. The\nsurvival of almost all living organisms\ndirectly or indirectly depends upon thefood made by the plants. Besides,\noxygen which is essential for the survivalYou have seen that buildings are made of bricks.\nSimilarly, the bodies of living organisms aremade of tiny units called cells. Cells can be seen\nonly under the microscope. Some organismsare made of only one cell. The cell is enclosed bya thin outer boundary, called the cell membrane .\nMost cells have a distinct, centrally locatedspherical structure called the nucleus (Fig. 1.1).The nucleus is surrounded by a jelly-like\nsubstance called cytoplasm .\nCell membraneCytoplasmNucleus\nFig. 1.1 Cell\nBoojho wants to know how water\nand minerals absorbed by roots\nreach the leaves.\nReprint 2024-25\n\nNUTRITION  IN PLANTS 3Besides leaves, photosynthesis also takes place in other green parts of the\nplant — in green stems and green branches. The desert plants have scale- or\nspine-like leaves to reduce loss of water by transpiration. These plants have\ngreen stems which carry out photosynthesis.\nof all organisms is produced duringphotosynthesis. In the absence ofphotosynthesis, life would be impossible\non the earth.\nDuring photosynthesis, chlorophyll\ncontaining cells of leaves (Fig. 1.2), inthe presence of sunlight, use carbon\ndioxide and water to synthesisecarbohydrates (Fig. 1.3). The process\ncan be represented in an equation:\nDuring the process oxygen is\nreleased. The presence of starch in\nleaves indicates the occurrence of\nphotosynthesis. Starch is also a\ncarbohydrate.  \nsunlight\nchlorophyllCarbon dioxide water \nCarbohydrate oxygen\nBoojho has observed some\nplants with deep red, violet or\nbrown leaves. He wants to\nknow whether these leaves\nalso carry out photosynthesis.\nActivity 1.1\nTake two potted plants of the same kind.\nKeep one in the dark (or in a black box)for 72 hours and the other in sunlight.\nFig. 1.2\n(a) LeafGuard cells\n(c) StomaStomatal opening(b) Section of a leaf\nFig. 1.3   Diagram showing\nphotosynthesis\nLight energy\nCarbon\ndioxide\nOxygenChlorophyll\nin leaf\nWater and\nminerals\nStoma Guard CellsChlorophyll\nReprint 2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 4Fig. 1.4  Leaves of various colourscarbohydrates are made of carbon,\nhydrogen and oxygen. These are usedto synthesise other components of food\nsuch as proteins and fats. But proteins\nare nitrogenous substances whichcontain nitrogen. From where do the\nplants obtain nitrogen?\nRecall that nitrogen is present in\nabundance in gaseous form in the air.However, plants cannot absorb nitrogen\nin this form. Soil has certain bacteria thatconvert gaseous nitrogen into a usable\nform and release it into the soil. These\nare absorbed by the plants along withwater. Also, you might have seen farmers\nadding fertilisers rich in nitrogen to the\nsoil. In this way the plants fulfil theirrequirements of nitrogen along with the\nother constituents. Plants can then\nsynthesise proteins and vitamins.\n1.3 O THER MODES OF NUTRITION  IN\nPLANTS\nThere are some plants which do not havechlorophyll. They cannot synthesisefood. How do they survive and from\nwhere do they derive nutrition? Like\nhumans and animals such plantsdepend on the food produced by other\nplants. They use the heterotrophic\nmode of nutrition. Look at Fig. 1.5. Do\nyou see a yellow wiry branched structure\ntwining around the stem and branches\nof a tree? This is a plant called Cuscuta(Amarbel). It does not have chlorophyll.\nIt takes readymade food from the plant\non which it is climbing. The plant onwhich it climbs is called the host. Since\nit deprives the host of valuable nutrients,You often see slimy, green patches\nin ponds or stagnant water bodies. Theseare generally formed by the growth oforganisms called algae. Can you guess\nwhy algae are green in colour? They\ncontain chlorophyll which gives themthe green colour. Algae can also prepare\ntheir own food by photosynthesis.\nSynthesis of plant food other\nthan carbohydrates\nYou have just learnt that plants\nsynthesise carbohydrates through theprocess of photosynthesis. The\nPerform iodine test with the leaves ofboth the plants as you did in Class VI.Record your results. Now leave the pot\nwhich was earlier kept in the dark, in\nthe sunlight for 3 – 4 days and performthe iodine test again on its leaves.\nRecord your observations in your\nnotebook.\nThe leaves other than green also have\nchlorophyll. The large amount of red,brown and other pigments mask thegreen colour (Fig. 1.4). Photosynthesis\ntakes place in these leaves also.\nReprint 2024-25\n\nNUTRITION  IN PLANTS 5Cuscuta is called the parasite . Are we\nand other animals also a kind of\nparasites? You should think about it\nand discuss with your teacher.hair which are directed downwards.When an insect lands in the pitcher, thelid closes and the trapped insect gets\nentangled into the hair. The lid closes\nand the insect is trapped. The insect isdigested by the digestive juices secreted\nin the pitcher and its nutrients are\nabsorbed. Such insect-eating plants arecalled insectivorous plants.\nIs it possible that such plants do not\nget all the required nutrients from thesoil in which they grow?\nFig. 1.5  Cuscuta (Amarbel) on host plant\nPaheli wants to know whether\nmosquitoes, bed bugs, lice and\nleeches that suck our blood are\nalso parasites.\nFig. 1.6  Pitcher plant showing lid and pitcherLeaf modified\ninto pitcherLid\nBoojho is confused. If the\npitcher plant is green and\ncarries out photosynthesis, then\nwhy does it feed on insects?\nHave you seen or heard of plants that\ncan eat animals? There are a few plants\nwhich can trap insects and digest them.Is it not amazing? Such plants may be\ngreen or of some other colour. Look at\nthe plant in Fig. 1.6. The pitcher-like orjug-like structure is the modified part\nof leaf. The apex of the leaf forms a lid\nwhich can open and close the mouth ofthe pitcher. Inside the pitcher there are1.4 S APROTROPHS\nYou might have seen packets of\nmushrooms sold in the vegetable\nReprint 2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 6\nmarket. You may have also seen fluffy\numbrella-like patches growing in moistsoils or on rotting wood during the rainy\nseason (Fig. 1.7). Let us find out what\ntype of nutrients they need to surviveand from where they get them.\nBoojho wants to know how\nthese organisms acquire\nnutrients. They do not have\nmouths like animals do. They are\nnot like green plants as they lack\nchlorophyll and cannot make food\nby photosynthesis.\nActivity 1.2\nTake a piece of bread and moisten it with\nwater. Leave it in a moist warm place\nfor 2–3 days or until fluffy patchesappear on them (Fig. 1.8). What is the\ncolour of these patches? Observe the\npatches under a microscope or amagnifying glass. Write down your\nobservations in the notebook. You will\nsee cotton-like threads spread on thepiece of bread.\nPaheli is keen to know\nwhether her beautiful shoes,\nwhich she wore on special\noccasions, were spoiled by fungi\nduring the rainy season. She\nwants to know how fungi appear\nsuddenly during the rainy\nseason.\nThese organisms are called fungi .\nThey have a different mode of nutrition.They absorb the nutrients from thebread. This mode of nutrition in which\norganisms take in nutrients from dead\nand decaying matter is calledsaprotrophic nutrition . Such organisms\nwith saprotrophic mode of nutrition arecalled saprotrophs .\nFungi also grow on pickles, leather,\nclothes and other articles that are leftin hot and humid weather for long time.During the rainy season they spoil many\nthings. Ask your parents about the\nmenace of fungi in your house.\nThe fungal spores are generally\npresent  in the air.

Do you know why this is done?\nYou learnt that plants absorb\nminerals and nutrients from the soil.So, their amounts in the soil keep ondeclining. Fertilisers and manures\ncontain nutrients such as nitrogen,\npotassium, phosphorous, etc. Thesenutrients need to be added from time\nto time to enrich the soil. We can grow\nplants and keep them healthy ifwe can fulfil the nutrient requirement\nof plants.\nUsually crop plants absorb a lot of\nnitrogen and the soil becomes deficientin nitrogen. You learnt that though\nnitrogen gas is available in plenty in theair, plants cannot use it in the manner\nthey can use carbon dioxide. They need\nnitrogen in a soluble form. Thebacterium called Rhizobium  can take\natmospheric nitrogen and convert it intoa usable form. But Rhizobium cannot\nmake its own food. So it often lives in\nthe roots of gram, peas, moong,  beans\nand other legumes and provides them\nwith nitrogen. In return, the plants\nprovide food and shelter to the\nbacteria. They, thus, have asymbiotic relationship. This association\nis of great significance for the\nfarmers. They can reduce the use ofnitrogenous fertiliser where leguminous\nBoojho says once his\ngrandfather told him that his\nwheat fields were spoiled by a\nfungus. He wants to know if\nfungi cause diseases also.\nPaheli told him that many fungi\nlike yeast and mushrooms are\nuseful, but some fungi\ncause diseases in plants,\nanimals including\nhumans. Some\nfungi are also\nused as medicines.\nwet and warm things they germinate and\ngrow. Now, can you figure out how we\ncan protect our things from gettingspoiled?\nSome organisms live together and\nshare both shelter and nutrients. Thisrelationship is called symbiosis . For\nexample, certain fungi live inside theroots of plants. The plants providenutrients to the fungus and, in return,\nthe fungus provides water and certain\nnutrients.\nIn organisms called lichens , a\nchlorophyll-containing partner, which isan alga, and a fungus live together. Thefungus provides shelter, water and\nminerals to the alga and, in return, the\nalga prepares and provides food to thefungus.\nReprint 2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 8\nWhat you have learnt\nAll organisms need food and utilise it to get energy for growth and\nmaintenance of their body.\nGreen plants synthesise food for themselves by the process of\nphotosynthesis.
