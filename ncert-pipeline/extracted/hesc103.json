It is a cleaner fuel.\nThe great advantage of CNG is that\nit can be used directly for burning in\nhomes and factories where it can be\nsupplied through pipes. Such a network\nof pipelines exists in V adodara (Gujarat),\nsome parts of Delhi and other places.\nNatural gas is also used as a starting\nmaterial for the manufacture of a number\nof chemicals and fertilisers. India has vast\nreserves of natural gas. In our country,\nnatural gas has been found in T ripura,\nRajasthan, Maharashtra and in the\nKrishna Godavari delta.3.4Some Natural Resources\nare Limited\nYou have studied in the beginning of\nthe chapter that some natural resources\nare exhaustible like fossil fuels, forests,\nminerals etc.\nYou know that coal and petr oleum\nare fossil fuels. It required the dead\norganisms millions of years to get\nconverted into these fuels. On the\nother hand, the known reserves of\nthese will last only a few hundred\nyears. Mor eover , bur ning of these\nfuels is a major cause of air pollution.\nTheir use is also linked to global\nwarming. It is therefore necessary that\nwe use these fuels only when\nabsolutely necessary. This will result\nin better environment, smaller risk of\nglobal warming and their availability\nfor a longer period of time.\nIn India, the Petroleum Conservation\nResearch Association (PCRA) advises\npeople how to save petrol/diesel while\ndriving. Their tips are\nldrive at a constant and moderate\nspeed as far as possible,\nlswitch off the engine at traffic lights\nor at a place where you have to wait,\nlensure correct tyre pressure.\nlensure regular maintenance of the\nvehicle.Can coal, petroleum\nand natural gas be\nprepared in the\nlaboratory from dead\norganisms?\nNo. Their\nformation is a very\nslow process and\nconditions for\ntheir formation\ncannot be created\nin the laboratory.\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 38\n KEYWORDS KEYWORDS KEYWORDS KEYWORDS KEYWORDS\nCOAL\nCOAL GAS\nCOAL T AR\nCOKE\nFOSSIL FUEL\nNATURAL GAS\nPETROLEUM\nPETROLEUM\nREFINERY WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT\nÜCoal, petroleum and natural gas are fossil\nfuels.\nÜFossil fuels were formed from the dead remains\nof living organisms millions of years ago.\nÜFossil fuels are exhaustible resources.\nÜCoke, coal tar and coal gas are the products\nof coal.\nÜPetroleum gas, petrol, diesel, kerosene,\nparaffin wax, lubricating oil are obtained by\nrefining petroleum.\nÜCoal and petr oleum r esour ces ar e limited.
