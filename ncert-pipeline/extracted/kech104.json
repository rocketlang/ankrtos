While the lone pairs are localised on the central \natom, each bonded \npair is shared between two atoms. As a result, the lone pair electrons in a molecule occupy more space as compared to the bonding pairs of\n\telectrons. \tThis\tresults\tin\tgreater\trepulsion \t\nbetween lone pairs of electrons as compared to\n\tthe\tlone\tpair\t-\tbond\tpair\tand\tbond\tpair\t-\t\nbond pair repulsions. \tThese\trepulsion \teffects\tresult\tin\tdeviations \tfrom\tidealised\tshapes\tand\t\nalterations in bond angles in molecules.\nFor the prediction of geometrical shapes \nof\tmolecules \twith\tthe\thelp\tof\tVSEPR\ttheory,\t\nit\tis\tconvenient \tto\tdivide\tmolecules \tinto\t\ntwo categories as (i) molecules in which \nthe central atom has no lone pair and  \n(ii) molecules in which the central atom has one or more lone pairs. \nTable\n\t4.6\t(page114) \tshows\tthe\t\narrangement of electron pairs about \na \ncentral\tatom\tA\t(without\tany\tlone\tpairs)\tand \ngeometries of some molecules/ions of the type AB.\n\tTable\t4.7\t(page\t115)\tshows\tshapes\tof\tsome\t\nsimple molecules and ions in which the central atom\n\thas\tone\tor\tmore\tlone\tpairs.\tTable\t4.8 \n(page\t116)\texplains\tthe\treasons\tfor\tthe\t\ndistortions in the geometry of the molecule.\nAs\tdepicted \tin\tTable\t4.6,\tin\tthe\t\ncompounds \tof\tAB2,\tAB3,\tAB4,\tAB5\tand\tAB6, \nthe arrangement of electron pairs and the B\n\tatoms\taround\tthe\tcentral\tatom\tA\tare\t: \nlinear, \ntrigonal planar, tetrahedral, \ntrigonal-bipyramidal and octahedral, respectively.\n\tSuch\tarrangement \tcan\tbe\tseen\t\nin\tthe\tmolecules \tlike\tBF3\t(AB3),\tCH4\t(AB4)\tand\t\nPCl5\t(AB5)\tas\tdepicted\tbelow\tby\ttheir\tball\tand \nstick models. \nThe\tVSEPR\tTheory\tis\table\tto\tpredict\t\ngeometry of a large number of molecules, especially the compounds of p -block\n\telements\t\naccurately.
