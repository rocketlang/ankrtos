      "content": "4.\n The equilibrium constant for the reverse reaction is equal to the inverse of the\n \nequilibrium constant for the forward reaction.\nUnit 6.indd   181 9/12/2022   11:58:24 AM\nReprint 2025-26\n\n182\nchemistry\n(a)  The decomposition of H2O into H2 and \nO2 at 500 K has a very small equilibrium \nconstant, Kc = 4.1 × 10–48\n(b) N2(g)  +  O2(g)  2NO(g),  \nat 298 K has Kc = 4.8 ×10–31.\n•\tIf Kc is in the range of 10–3 to 103, \nappreciable concentrations of both \nreactants and products are present. Consider the following examples:\n(a) \n For reaction of H2 with I2 to give HI, \n Kc = 57.0 at 700K.\n(b)  Also, gas phase decomposition of N2O4 \nto NO2 is another reaction with a value \nof Kc = 4.64 × 10–3 at 25°C which is \nneither too small nor too large. Hence, equilibrium mixtures contain appreciable concentrations of both N\n2O4 and NO2.\n These generarlisations are illustrated in Fig. 6.6If Q\nc = Kc, the reaction mixture is already \nat equilibrium.\nConsider the gaseous reaction of H2  \nwith I2,\nH2(g) + I2(g)  2HI(g); Kc = 57.0 at 700 K.\nSuppose we have molar concentrations \n[H2]t=0.10M, [I2]t = 0.20 M and [HI]t = 0.40 M.\n(the subscript t on the concentration symbols means that the concentrations were measured at some arbitrary time t, not necessarily at equilibrium). \nThus, the reaction quotient, Q\nc at this \nstage of the reaction is given by,Q\nc = [HI]t2 / [H2]t [I2]t  = (0.40)2/ (0.10)×(0.20) \n                           = 8.0\nNow, in this case, Qc (8.0) does not equal \nKc (57.0), so the mixture of H2(g), I2(g) and HI(g) \nis not at equilibrium; that is, more H2(g) and \nI2(g) will react to form more HI(g) and their \nconcentrations will decrease till Qc = Kc.\nThe reaction quotient, Qc is useful in \npredicting the direction of reaction by \ncomparing the values of Qc and Kc.\nThus, we can make the following \ngeneralisations concerning the direction of \nthe reaction (Fig. 6.7) :Fig.6.6  Dependence of extent of reaction on Kc \n6.6.2  Predicting the Direction of the \nreaction\nThe equilibrium constant helps \nin predicting \nthe direction in which a given reaction will \nproceed at any stage. For this purpose, we calculate the reaction quotient Q . \nThe reaction quotient, Q  (Q\nc with molar \nconcentrations and QP with partial pressures) \nis defined in the same way as the equilibrium constant K\nc except that the concentrations \nin Qc are not necessarily equilibrium values.  \nFor a general reaction:\na A + b B    c C + d D         (6.19)\nQc = [C]c[D]d / [A]a[B]b                  (6.20)\nThen, \nIf Qc > Kc, the reaction will proceed in the \ndirection of reactants (reverse reaction).\nIf Qc < Kc, the reaction will proceed in the \ndirection of the products (forward reaction).Fig. 6.7  Predicting the direction of the reaction\n•\tIf Qc < Kc, net reaction goes from left to \nright\n•\tIf Qc > Kc, net reaction goes from right to \nleft.\n•\tIf Qc = Kc, no net reaction occurs.\nProblem 6.7\nThe value of Kc for the reaction\n2A  B + C is 2 × 10–3.

Write the balanced equation for \nthe \nreaction.Step 2. Under the balanced equation, make \na table that lists for each substance involved in the reaction:\n(a)\n the initial concentration,\n(b) the change in concentration on going to \nequilibrium, and\n(c) the equilibrium concentration.\nIn constructing the table, \ndefine x as the \nconcentration (mol/L) of one of the substances \nthat reacts on going to equilibrium, then use the stoichiometry of the reaction to determine the concentrations of the other substances in terms of x.\nStep 3. Substitute the equilibrium \nconcentrations into the equilibrium equation \nfor the reaction and solve for x. If you are to solve a quadratic equation choose the mathematical solution that makes chemical sense.\nStep 4. Calculate the equilibrium \nconcentrations from the calculated value of x.\nStep 5.

However, as you \nhave studied in Unit 5, it is directly related  \nto the thermodynamics of the reaction and  \nin particular, to the change in Gibbs energy, ∆G. If,\n•\t∆G is negative, then the reaction is \nspontaneous and proceeds in the forward \ndirection.\n•\t∆G is positive, then reaction is considered non-spontaneous. Instead, as reverse reaction would have a negative ∆ G, the \nproducts of the forward reaction shall be converted to the reactants.\n•\t∆G is 0, reaction has achieved equilibrium; \nat this point, there is no longer any free energy left to drive the reaction.\nA mathematical expression of this \nthermodynamic view of equilibrium can be \ndescribed by the following equation:\n∆G  = ∆G\n + RT lnQ                                     (6.21)\nwhere, G is standard Gibbs energy. \nAt equilibrium, when ∆G = 0 and Q = Kc, \nthe equation (6.21) becomes,\n∆G = ∆G + RT ln K = 0\n∆G = – RT lnK                                      (6.22)\nlnK = – ∆G / RT\nUnit 6.indd   184 9/12/2022   11:58:25 AM\nReprint 2025-26\n\n185\nEQUILIBRIUM\nFig. 6.8  Effect of addition of H2 on change \nof concentration for the reactants \nand products in the reaction,  \nH2(g) + I2 (g)  2HI(g)reactants to products while minimising the \nexpenditure of energy. This implies maximum yield of products at mild temperature and pressure conditions. If it does not happen, then the experimental conditions need to be adjusted. For example, in the Haber process for the synthesis of ammonia from N\n2 and \nH2, the choice of experimental conditions is \nof real economic importance. Annual world  production of ammonia is about hundred million tones, primarily for use as fertilisers.\nEquilibrium constant, K\nc is independent \nof initial concentrations. But if a system at equilibrium is subjected to a change in the concentration of one or more of the reacting substances, then the system is no longer at equilibrium; and net reaction takes place in some direction until the system returns to equilibrium once again. Similarly, a change in temperature or pressure of the system may also alter the equilibrium. In order to decide what course the reaction adopts and make a qualitative prediction about the effect of a change in conditions on equilibrium we use Le Chatelier’s principle. It states that a change in any of the factors that determine the equilibrium conditions of a system will cause the system to change in such a manner so as to reduce or to counteract the effect of the change. This is applicable to all physical and chemical equilibria. \nWe shall now be discussing factors which \ncan influence the equilibrium.\n6.8.1\n Effect of Concentration Change\nIn general, w\nhen equilibrium is disturbed \nby the addition/removal of any reactant/\nproducts, Le Chatelier’s principle predicts that:\n•\n The concentration stress of an added  \nreactant/product is relieved by net \nreaction in \nthe direction that consumes \nthe added substance.\n• The concentration stress of a removed reactant/product is relieved by net reaction \nin the direction that replenishes \nthe removed substance.\n or in other words, “When the concentration of any of the \nreactants \nor products in a reaction at \nequilibrium is changed, the composition \nof the equilibrium mixture changes so as to minimize the effect of concentration changes”.\n Let us take the reaction,\nH2(g) + I2(g)  2HI(g)\nIf H2 is added to the reaction mixture \nat equilibrium, then the equilibrium of the \nreaction is disturbed. In order to restore it, the reaction proceeds in a direction wherein H\n2 is consumed, i.e.,  more of H2 and I2 react \nto form HI and finally the equilibrium shifts in right (forward) direction (Fig.6.8). This is in accordance with the Le Chatelier’s principle which implies that in case of addition of a reactant/product, a new equilibrium will be set up in which the concentration of the reactant/product should be less than what it was after the addition but more than what it was in the original mixture.\nThe same point can be explained in terms \nof the reaction quotient, Q\nc,\nQc = [HI]2/ [H2][I2]\nUnit 6.indd   185 11/30/2022   15:48:33\nReprint 2025-26\n\n186\nchemistry\nAddition of hydrogen at equilibrium \nresults in value of Qc being less than Kc . Thus, \nin order to attain equilibrium again reaction \nmoves in the forward direction. Similarly, we can say that removal of a product also boosts the forward reaction and increases the concentration of the products and this has great commercial application in cases of reactions, where the product is a gas or a volatile substance. In case of manufacture of ammonia, ammonia is liquified and removed from the reaction mixture so that reaction keeps moving in forward direction. Similarly, in the large scale production of CaO (used as important building material) from CaCO\n3, \nconstant removal of CO2 from the kiln drives \nthe reaction to completion. It should be remembered that continuous removal of a product maintains Q\nc at a value less than Kc \nand reaction continues to move in the forward direction.\nEffect of Concentration – An experiment\nThis can be demonstrated by the following \nreaction: \nFe\n3+(aq)+ SCN–(aq)  [Fe(SCN)]2+(aq)        (6.24)\nyellow      colourless      deep red\n        (6.25)\nA reddish colour appears on adding two \ndrops of 0.002 M potassium thiocynate solution\n \nto 1 mL of 0.2 M iron(III) nitrate solution due \nto the formation of [Fe(SCN)]2+. The intensity \nof the red colour becomes constant on attaining equilibrium. This equilibrium can be shifted in either forward or reverse directions depending on our choice of adding a reactant or a product. The equilibrium can be shifted in the opposite direction by adding reagents that remove Fe\n3+ or SCN– ions. For example, \noxalic acid (H2C2O4), reacts with Fe3+ ions \nto form the stable complex ion [Fe(C2O4)3]3–, \nthus decreasing the concentration of free Fe\n3+(aq). In accordance with the Le Chatelier’s \nprinciple, the concentration stress of removed Fe\n3+ is relieved by dissociation of [Fe(SCN)]2+ \nto replenish the Fe3+ ions. Because the concentration of [Fe(SCN)]2+ decreases, the \nintensity of red colour decreases.\nAddition of aq. HgCl2 also decreases red \ncolour because Hg2+ reacts with SCN– ions to \nform stable complex ion [Hg(SCN)4]2–. Removal \nof free SCN– (aq) shifts the equilibrium \nin equation (6.24) from right to left to \nreplenish SCN– ions.  Addition of potassium \nthiocyanate on the other hand increases the colour intensity of the solution as it shift the equilibrium to right.\n6.8.2\n Effect of Pressure Change\nA pressure change obtained by changing the \nvolume can affect the yield of products in case of\n a gaseous reaction where the total \nnumber of moles of gaseous reactants and total number of moles of gaseous products are different. In applying Le Chatelier’s principle to a heterogeneous equilibrium the effect of pressure changes on solids and liquids can be ignored because the volume (and concentration) of a solution/liquid is nearly independent of pressure.\nConsider the reaction,\nCO(g) + 3H\n2(g)  CH4(g) + H2O(g)\nHere, 4 mol of gaseous reactants (CO + 3H2) \nbecome 2 mol of gaseous products (CH4 + \nH2O). Suppose equilibrium mixture (for above \nreaction) kept in a cylinder fitted with a piston \nat constant temperature is compressed to one half of its original volume. Then, total pressure will be doubled (according to  \npV = constant). The partial pressure and therefore, concentration of reactants and products have changed and the mixture is no longer at equilibrium. The direction in which the reaction goes to re-establish equilibrium can be predicted by applying the Le Chatelier’s principle. Since pressure has doubled, the equilibrium now shifts in the forward direction, a direction in which the number of moles of the gas or pressure decreases (we know pressure is proportional to moles of the gas). This can also be understood by using reaction quotient, Q\nc. Let [CO], [H2], [CH4] \nand [H2O] be the molar concentrations at \nequilibrium for methanation reaction. When \nvolume of the reaction mixture is halved, the \nUnit 6.indd   186 9/12/2022   11:58:25 AM\nReprint 2025-26\n\n187\nEQUILIBRIUM\nFig. 6.9  Effect of temperature on equilibrium for \nthe reaction, 2NO2 (g)  N2O4 (g)\npartial pressure and the concentration are \ndoubled. We obtain the reaction quotient by replacing each equilibrium concentration by \ndouble its value.\nQc=()  () \n()  () CHgH Og\nCOgH g42\n23\nAs Qc < Kc , the reaction proceeds in the \nforward direction.\nIn reaction C(s) + CO2(g)  2CO(g), when \npressure is increased, the reaction goes in the \nreverse direction because the number of moles of gas increases in the forward direction.\n6.8.3\n Effect of Inert Gas Addition\nIf the volume is kept constant and an inert gas \nsuch as argon is added which does not take part in the reaction, the equilibrium remains un\ndisturbed. It is because the addition of \nan inert gas at constant volume does not change the partial pressures or the molar concentrations of the substance involved in the reaction. The reaction quotient changes only if the added gas is a reactant or product involved in the reaction.\n6.8.4\n Effect of Temperature Change\nWhenever an equilibrium is disturbed by \na change in the concentration, pressure or volume, the composition \nof the equilibrium \nmixture changes because the reaction quotient, Q\nc no longer equals the equilibrium \nconstant, Kc. However, when a change in \ntemperature occurs, the value of equilibrium constant, K\nc  is changed.\nIn general, the temperature dependence \nof the equilibrium constant depends on the \nsign of ∆H for the reaction.\n•\tThe equilibrium constant for an exothermic \nreaction (negative ∆H) decreases as the \ntemperature increases.\n•\tThe equilibrium constant for an endothermic reaction (positive ∆H) \nincreases as the temperature increases.\nTemperature changes affect the \nequilibrium constant and rates of reactions. Production of ammonia according to the \nreaction,\nN\n2(g) + 3H2(g)  2NH3(g); \n∆H= – 92.38 kJ mol–1\nis an exothermic process. According to  \nLe Chatelier’s principle, raising the \ntemperature shifts the equilibrium to left and decreases the equilibrium concentration of ammonia. In other words, low temperature is favourable for high yield of ammonia, but practically very low temperatures slow down the reaction and thus a catalyst is used.\nEffect of Temperature – An experiment\nEffect of temperature on equilibrium can \nbe demonstrated by taking NO\n2 gas (brown \nin colour) which dimerises into N2O4 gas \n(colourless).\n2NO2(g)  N2O4(g); ∆H = –57.2 kJ mol–1\nNO2 gas prepared by addition of Cu \nturnings to conc. HNO3 is collected in two  \n5 mL test tubes (ensuring same intensity of colour of gas in each tube) and stopper sealed with araldite. Three 250 mL beakers 1, 2 and 3 containing freesing mixture, water at room temperature and hot water (363K), respectively, are taken (Fig. 6.9). Both the test tubes are placed in beaker 2 for 8-10 minutes. After this one is placed in beaker 1 and the other in beaker  3. The effect of temperature on direction of reaction is depicted very well in this experiment. At low temperatures in beaker 1, the forward reaction of formation of N\n2O4 is preferred, as reaction is exothermic, \nand thus, intensity of brown colour due to NO\n2 decreases. While in beaker 3, high \ntemperature favours the reverse reaction of \nUnit 6.indd   187 11/2/2022   4:11:28 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\n188\nchemistry\nformation of NO2 and thus, the brown colour \nintensifies.\nEffect of temperature can also be seen in \nan endothermic reaction,\n[Co(H2O)6]3+(aq) + 4Cl–(aq) [CoCl4 ]2–(aq) +   \n                                                               6H2O(l)\n pink  colourless  blue\nAt room temperature, the equilibrium \nmixture is blue due to [CoCl4]2–. When cooled \nin a freesing mixture, the colour of the mixture \nturns pink due to [Co(H2O)6]3+.\n6.8.5  Effect of a Catalyst\nA catalyst increases the rate of the chemical \nreaction by making available a new low energy pathway for \nthe conversion of reactants to \nproducts. It increases the rate of forward and reverse reactions that pass through the same transition state and does not affect equilibrium. Catalyst lowers the activation energy for the forward and reverse reactions by exactly the same amount. Catalyst does not affect the equilibrium composition of a reaction mixture. It does not appear in the balanced chemical equation or in the equilibrium constant expression.\nLet us consider the formation of NH\n3 \nfrom dinitrogen and dihydrogen which is highly exothermic reaction and proceeds with decrease in total number of moles formed as compared to the reactants. Equilibrium constant decreases with increase in temperature. At low temperature rate decreases and it takes long time to reach at equilibrium, whereas high temperatures give \nsatisfactory rates but poor yields. \nGerman chemist, Fritz Haber discovered \nthat a catalyst consisting of iron catalyse \nthe reaction to occur at a satisfactory rate at temperatures, where the equilibrium concentration of NH\n3 is reasonably favourable. \nSince the number of moles formed in the reaction is less than those of reactants, the yield of NH\n3 can be improved by increasing \nthe pressure.\nOptimum conditions of temperature \nand pressure for the synthesis of NH3 using \ncatalyst are around 500°C and 200 atm.Similarly, in manufacture of sulphuric \nacid by contact process,\n2SO2(g) + O2(g)  2SO3(g);  Kc = 1.7 × 1026\nthough the value of K is suggestive of reaction \ngoing to completion, but practically the \noxidation of SO2 to SO3 is very slow. Thus, \nplatinum or divanadium penta-oxide (V2O5) \nis used as catalyst to increase the rate of the reaction.\nNote: If a reaction has an exceedingly small \nK, a catalyst would be of little help.\n6.9\n IONIC EQUILIBRIUM IN SOLUTION\nUnder the effect of change of concentration \non the directi\non of equilibrium, you have \nincidently come across with the following \nequilibrium which involves ions:\nFe3+(aq) + SCN–(aq)  [Fe(SCN)]2+(aq)\nThere are numerous equilibria that involve \nions only. In the following sections we will \nstudy the equilibria involving ions. It is well known that the aqueous solution of sugar does not conduct electricity. However, when common salt (sodium chloride) is added to water it conducts electricity. Also, the conductance of electricity increases with an increase in concentration of common salt. Michael Faraday classified the substances into two categories based on their ability to conduct electricity. One category of substances conduct electricity in their aqueous solutions and are called electrolytes  \nwhile the other do not and are thus, referred to as non-electrolytes. Faraday further classified \nelectrolytes into strong and weak electrolytes. \nStrong electrolytes on dissolution in water are ionized almost completely, while the weak electrolytes are only partially dissociated.  \nFor example, an aqueous solution of  \nsodium chloride is comprised entirely of \nsodium ions and chloride ions, while that  \nof acetic acid mainly contains unionized  \nacetic acid molecules and only some acetate ions and hydronium ions. This is because  \nthere is almost 100% ionization in case of sodium chloride as compared to less  \nthan 5% ionization of acetic acid which is  \na weak electrolyte.

This type of equilibrium involving ions in aqueous solution is called ionic equilibrium. Acids, bases and salts come under the category of electrolytes and may act as either strong or weak electrolytes.\n6.10\n ACiDS, bASES A nD SAltS\nAcids, bases and salts find widespread \noccurrence i\nn nature. Hydrochloric acid \npresent in the gastric juice is secreted by the lining of our stomach in a significant amount of 1.2-1.5 L/day and is essential for digestive  processes. Acetic acid is known to be the main constituent of vinegar. Lemon and orange juices contain citric and ascorbic acids, and tartaric acid is found in tamarind paste. As most of the acids taste sour, the word “acid” has been derived from a latin word “acidus” meaning sour. Acids are known to turn blue litmus paper into red and liberate dihydrogen on reacting with some metals. Similarly, bases are known to turn red litmus paper blue, taste bitter and feel soapy. A common example of a base is washing soda used for washing purposes. When acids and bases are mixed in the right proportion they react with each other to give salts. Some commonly known \nexamples of salts are sodium chloride, barium sulphate, sodium nitrate.  Sodium chloride (common salt) is an important component of our diet and is formed by reaction between hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide. It exists in solid state as a cluster of positively \ncharged sodium ions and negatively charged chloride ions which are held together due to electrostatic interactions between oppositely charged species (Fig.6.10). The electrostatic forces between two charges are inversely proportional to dielectric constant of the medium. Water, a universal solvent, possesses a very high dielectric constant of 80. Thus, when sodium chloride is dissolved in water, the electrostatic interactions are reduced by a factor of 80 and this facilitates the ions to move freely in the solution. Also, they are well-separated due to hydration with water molecules. \nFaraday was born near London into a family of very limited means. At the age of \n14 he was an apprentice to a kind bookbinder who allowed Faraday to read the books he was binding. Through a fortunate chance he became laboratory assistant to Davy, and during 1813-4, Faraday accompanied him to the Continent.  During this trip he gained much from the experience of coming into contact with many of the leading scientists of the time.

The extent to which ionization occurs depends upon the strength of the bond and the extent of solvation of ions produced. The terms dissociation and ionization have earlier been used with different meaning. Dissociation refers to the process of separation of ions in water already existing as such in the solid state of the solute, as in sodium chloride. On the other hand, ionization corresponds to a process in which a neutral molecule splits into charged ions in the solution. Here, we shall not distinguish between the two and use the two terms interchangeably. \n6.10.1\n Arrhenius Concept of Acids and \nbases\nAccording to Arrhenius theory, acids are\n \nsubstances that dissociates in water to \ngive hydrogen ions H+(aq) and bases are \nsubstances that produce hydroxyl ions  \nOH–(aq). The ionization of an acid HX (aq) can \nbe represented by the following equations:\nHX (aq) → H+(aq) + X– (aq)\nor\nHX(aq) + H2O(l) → H3O+(aq) + X –(aq)\nA bare proton, H+ is very reactive and \ncannot exist freely in aqueous solutions. \nThus, it bonds to the oxygen atom of a solvent water molecule to give trigonal pyramidal  \nhydronium ion, H\n3O+ {[H (H2O)]+} (see box). In \nthis chapter we shall use H+(aq) and H3O+(aq) \ninterchangeably to mean the same i.e., a hydrated proton. \nSimilarly, a base molecule like MOH \nionizes in aqueous solution according to the equation:\nMOH(aq) → M\n+(aq) + OH–(aq)\nThe hydroxyl ion also exists in the hydrated form in the aqueous solution. Arrhenius concept of acid and base, however, suffers from the limitation of being applicable only to aqueous solutions and also, does not account for the basicity of substances like, ammonia which do not possess a hydroxyl group.6.10.2\n the brönsted- lowry Acids and \nbases\nThe Danish chemist, Johannes Brönsted and \nthe English chemist, Thomas M. Lowry gave a more \ngeneral definition of acids and bases. \nAccording to Brönsted-Lowry theory, acid \nis a substance that is capable of donating a hydrogen ion H\n+ and bases are substances \ncapable of accepting a hydrogen ion, H+. In \nshort, acids are proton donors and bases are proton acceptors. \nConsider the example of dissolution of NH\n3 \nin H2O represented by the following equation:Hydronium and Hydroxyl ions\nHydrogen ion by itself is a bare proton with very \nsmall size (~10–15 m radius) and intense electric \nfield, binds itself with the water molecule at one of the two available lone pairs on it giving H\n3O+. This species has been detected in many \ncompounds (e.g., H3O+Cl–) in the solid state. In \naqueous solution the hydronium ion is further hydrated to give species like H\n5O2+, H7O3+ and \nH9O4+. Similarly the hydroxyl ion is hydrated \nto give several ionic species like H3O2–, H5O3– \nand H7O4– etc.\nThe basic solution is formed due to the \npresence of hydroxyl ions. In this reaction, \nwater molecule acts as proton donor and ammonia molecule acts as proton acceptor and are thus, called Lowry-Brönsted acid and H9O4+\nUnit 6.indd   190 9/12/2022   11:58:26 AM\nReprint 2025-26\n\n191\nEQUILIBRIUM\nArrhenius was born near Uppsala, Sweden.

For the next\n\tfive\tyears\the\ttravelled \textensively \tand\tvisited\ta\tnumber\tof\tresearch \tcenters\t\nin Europe. In 1895 he was appointed professor of physics at the newly formed University of Stockholm, \nserving its rector from 1897 to 1902.  From 1905 until his \ndeath he was Director of physical chemistry at the Nobel Institute in Stockholm.  He continued to work for many years on electrolytic solutions.  In 1899 he discussed the temperature dependence of reaction rates on the basis of an equation, now usually known as Arrhenius equation.\nHe worked in a variety of fields, and made important contributions to \nimmunochemistry, cosmology, the origin of life, and the causes of ice age.

In the reverse reaction, \nH+ is transferred from NH4+ to OH–. In this \ncase, NH4+ acts as a Bronsted acid while \nOH– acted as a Brönsted base. The acid-base \npair that differs only by one proton is called a conjugate acid-base pair. Therefore, OH\n– \nis called the conjugate base of an acid H2O \nand NH4+ is called conjugate acid of the base \nNH3. If Brönsted acid is a strong acid then \nits conjugate base is a weak base and vice-\nversa. It may be noted that conjugate acid \nhas one extra proton and each conjugate base has one less proton.\nConsider the example of ionization of \nhydrochloric acid in water. HCl(aq) acts as an acid by donating a proton to H\n2O molecule \nwhich acts as a base.in case of ammonia it acts as an acid by donating a proton.\nProblem 6.12\nWhat will be the conjugate bases for the \nfollowing Brönsted acids: HF, H\n2SO4 and \nHCO3– ?\nSolution\nThe conjugate bases should have one \nproton less in each case and therefore the corresponding conjugate bases are: F\n–, \nHSO4– and CO32– respectively.\nProblem 6.13\nWrite the conjugate acids for the following \nBrönsted bases: NH2–, NH3 and HCOO–.\nSolution\nThe conjugate acid should have one extra \nproton in each case and therefore the corresponding conjugate acids are: NH\n3, \nNH4+ and HCOOH respectively.\nProblem 6.14\nThe species: H2O, HCO3–, HSO4– and NH3 can \nact both as Bronsted acids and bases. For \neach case give the corresponding conjugate acid and conjugate base.\nSolution\nThe answer is given in the following Table:\nSpecies\n     Conjugate       Conjugate \n          acid           base\nH2O   H3O+  OH–\nHCO3–   H2CO3  CO32–\nHSO4–   H2SO4  SO42–\nNH3   NH4+  NH2–Svante Arrhenius\n(1859-1927)\nIt can be seen in the above equation, that \nwater acts as a base because it accepts the \nproton. The species H3O+ is produced when \nwater accepts a proton from HCl. Therefore, Cl\n– is a conjugate base of HCl and HCl is the \nconjugate acid of base Cl–. Similarly, H2O is \na conjugate base of an acid H3O+ and H3O+ is \na conjugate acid of base H2O.\nIt is interesting to observe the dual role \nof water as an acid and a base. In case of reaction with HCl water acts as a base while \nUnit 6.indd   191 9/12/2022   11:58:26 AM\nReprint 2025-26\n\n192\nchemistry\n6.10.3  lewis Acids and bases\nG.N. Lewis in 1923 defined an acid as \na \nspecies which accepts electron pair and base \nwhich donates an electron pair. As far as bases are concerned, there is not much difference between Brönsted-Lowry and Lewis concepts, as the base provides a lone pair in both the cases. However, in Lewis concept many acids do not have proton. A typical example is reaction of electron deficient species BF\n3 \nwith NH3.\nBF3 does not have a proton but still acts \nas an acid and reacts with NH3 by accepting \nits lone pair of electrons. The reaction can be represented by,\nBF\n3 + :NH3 → BF3:NH3\nElectron deficient species  like AlCl3, Co3+, \nMg2+, etc.  can act as Lewis acids while species \nlike H2O, NH3, OH– etc. which can donate a \npair of electrons, can act as Lewis bases.\nProblem 6.15\nClassify the following species into Lewis \nacids and Lewis bases and show how these act as such:\n(a) HO\n– (b) F–       (c) H+  (d) BCl3\nSolution \n(a) Hydroxyl ion is a Lewis base as it can \ndonate an electron lone pair (:OH– ).\n(b) Flouride ion acts as a Lewis base as it can donate any one of its \nfour \nelectron lone pairs.\n(c) A proton is a Lewis acid \nas it can \naccept a lone pair of electrons from bases like hydroxyl ion and fluoride ion.\n(d) \n BCl3 acts as a Lewis acid as it can \naccept a lone pair of electrons from species like ammonia or amine molecules.\n6.11\n iOniZAtiOn OF AC iDS AnD bASES\nArrhenius concept of \nacids and bases \nbecomes useful in case of ionization of acids and bases as mostly ionizations in chemical and biological systems occur in aqueous medium. Strong acids like perchloric acid (HClO\n4), hydrochloric acid (HCl), hydrobromic \nacid (HBr), hyrdoiodic acid (HI), nitric acid (HNO\n3) and sulphuric acid (H2SO4) are termed \nstrong because they are almost completely dissociated into their constituent ions in an aqueous medium, thereby acting as proton (H\n+) donors. Similarly, strong bases like \nlithium hydroxide (LiOH), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), potassium hydroxide (KOH), caesium hydroxide (CsOH) and barium hydroxide Ba(OH)\n2 are almost completely dissociated \ninto ions in an aqueous medium giving hydroxyl ions, OH\n–. According to Arrhenius \nconcept they are strong acids and bases as they are able to completely dissociate and produce H\n3O+\n and OH– ions respectively in \nthe medium. Alternatively, the strength of an acid or base may also be gauged in terms of Brönsted-Lowry concept of acids and bases, wherein a strong acid means a good proton donor and a strong base implies a good proton acceptor. Consider, the acid-base dissociation equilibrium of a weak acid HA,\nHA(aq)  +  H\n2O(l)   H3O+(aq)  +  A–(aq)\n                                     conjugate    conjugate\nacid         base              acid            base\nIn section 6.10.2 we saw that acid (or \nbase) \ndissociation equilibrium is dynamic \ninvolving a transfer of proton in forward and \nreverse directions. Now, the question arises that if the equilibrium is dynamic then with passage of time which direction is favoured? What is the driving force behind it? In order to answer these questions we shall deal into the issue of comparing the strengths of the two acids (or bases) involved in the dissociation equilibrium. Consider the two acids HA and H\n3O+ present in the above \nmentioned acid-dissociation equilibrium. We have to see which amongst them is a stronger proton donor. Whichever exceeds in its tendency of donating a proton over the other shall be termed as the stronger acid and the equilibrium will shift in the direction of weaker acid. Say, if HA is a stronger acid than H\n3O+, then HA will donate protons and \nnot H3O+, and the solution will mainly contain \nA– and H3O+ ions. The equilibrium moves in \nthe direction of formation of weaker acid \nUnit 6.indd   192 9/12/2022   11:58:26 AM\nReprint 2025-26\n\n193\nEQUILIBRIUM\nand weaker base because the stronger acid \ndonates a proton to the stronger base . \nIt follows that \nas a strong acid dissociates \ncompletely in water, the resulting base formed would be very weak i.e., strong acids have \nvery weak conjugate bases. Strong acids like perchloric acid (HClO\n4), hydrochloric acid \n(HCl), hydrobromic acid (HBr), hydroiodic acid (HI), nitric acid (HNO\n3) and sulphuric acid \n(H2SO4) will give conjugate base ions ClO4–, Cl, \nBr–, I–, NO3– and HSO4– , which are much weaker \nbases than H2O. Similarly a very strong base \nwould give a very weak conjugate acid. On the other hand, a weak acid say HA is only partially dissociated in aqueous medium and thus, the solution mainly contains undissociated HA molecules. Typical weak acids are nitrous acid (HNO\n2), hydrofluoric acid (HF) and acetic \nacid (CH3COOH). It should be noted that the \nweak acids have very strong conjugate bases. For example, NH\n2–, O2– and H– are very good \nproton acceptors and thus, much stronger bases than H\n2O. \nCertain water soluble organic compounds \nlike phenolphthalein and bromothymol blue behave as weak acids and exhibit different colours in their acid (HIn) and conjugate base (In\n– ) forms.\nHIn(aq)  +   H2O(l)     H3O+(aq)   +   In–(aq)  \nacid    conjugate  conjugate\nindicator         acid           base\ncolour A        \n        colour B\nSuch compounds are useful as indicators \nin acid-base titrations, and finding out H+ ion \nconcentration.\n6.11.1  the ionization Constant of Water \nand its ionic Product\nSome substances like water are unique in\n \ntheir ability of acting both as an acid and a \nbase. We have seen this in case of water in section 6.10.2. In presence of an acid, HA it accepts a proton and acts as the base while in the presence of a base, B\n– it acts as an \nacid by donating a proton. In pure water, one H\n2O molecule donates proton and acts as an \nacid and another water molecules accepts a proton and acts as a base at the same time.   \nThe following equilibrium exists:H\n2O(l)  +  H2O(l)     H3O+(aq)  +   OH–(aq)\nacid        base         conjugate       conjugate\n                          acid                base\nThe dissociation constant is represented by,\nK = [H3O+] [OH–] / [H2O]                    (6.26)\nThe concentration of water is omitted from \nthe denominator as water is a pure liquid and \nits concentration remains constant. [H2O] is \nincorporated within the equilibrium constant  \nto give a new constant, Kw, which is called the \nionic product of water. \n Kw = [H+][OH–]            (6.27)\nThe concentration of H+ has been found \nout experimentally as 1.0 × 10–7 M at 298 K. \nAnd, as dissociation of water produces equal number of H\n+ and OH– ions, the concentration \nof hydroxyl ions, [OH–] = [H+] = 1.0 × 10–7 M.  \nThus, the value of Kw at 298K,\nKw = [H3O+][OH–] = (1 × 10–7)2 = 1 × 10–14 M2 \n(6.28)\nThe value of Kw is temperature dependent \nas it is an equilibrium constant.\nThe density of pure water is 1000 g / L \nand its molar mass is 18.0 g /mol. From this the molarity of pure water can be given as,\n[H\n2O] = (1000 g /L)(1 mol/18.0 g) = 55.55 M. \nTherefore, the ratio of dissociated water to \nthat of undissociated water can be given as:\n10–7 / (55.55) = 1.8 × 10–9 or  ~ 2 in 10–9 (thus, \nequilibrium lies mainly towards undissociated \nwater)\nWe can distinguish acidic, neutral and \nbasic aqueous solutions by the relative values \nof the H3O+ and OH– concentrations:\nAcidic: [H3O+] > [OH– ]\nNeutral: [H3O+] = [OH– ]\nBasic : [H3O+] < [OH–]\n6.11.2  the pH Scale\nHydronium ion concentration in \nmolarity is \nmore conveniently expressed on a logarithmic \nscale known as the pH scale. The pH of a solution is defined as the negative logarithm \nto base 10 of the activity \naH/unif02b/unif028/unif029  of hydrogen \nUnit 6.indd   193 9/12/2022   11:58:26 AM\nReprint 2025-26\n\n194\nchemistry\nion. In dilute solutions (< 0.01 M), activity \nof hydrogen ion (H+) is equal in magnitude \nto molarity represented by [H+]. It should  \nbe noted that activity has no units and is \ndefined as:\n  = [H+] / mol L–1\nFrom the definition of pH, the following \ncan be written,\npH = – log aH+ = – log {[H+] / mol L–1}\nThus, an acidic solution of HCl (10–2 M) \nwill have a pH = 2. Similarly, a basic solution \nof NaOH having [OH–] =10–4 M and [H3O+] =  \n10–10 M will have a pH = 10. At 25 °C, pure \nwater has a concentration of hydrogen ions,  \n[H+] = 10–7 M. Hence, the pH of pure water is \ngiven as:\npH = –log(10–7) = 7\nAcidic solutions possess a concentration \nof hydrogen ions, [H+] > 10–7 M, while basic \nsolutions possess a concentration of hydrogen ions, [H\n+] < 10–7 M. thus, we can summarise \nthatAcidic solution has pH < 7\nBasic solution has pH > 7Neutral solution has pH = 7\nNow again, consider the equation (6.28) \nat 298 K\nK\nw = [H3O+] [OH–] = 10–14\nTaking negative logarithm on both sides \nof equation, we obtain\n–log Kw = – log {[H3O+] [OH–]} \n             = – log [H3O+] – log [OH–] \n            = – log 10–14\n   pKw  =   pH  +  pOH   =   14             (6.29)\nNote that although Kw may change \nwith temperature the variations in pH with \ntemperature are so small that we often  \nignore it.\npKw is a very important quantity for \naqueous solutions and controls the relative \nconcentrations of hydrogen and hydroxyl ions as their product is a constant. It should be noted that as the pH scale is logarithmic, a change in pH by just one unit also means change in [H\n+] by a factor of 10. Similarly, when the hydrogen ion concentration, [H+] \nchanges by a factor of 100, the value of pH changes by 2 units. Now you can realise why the change in pH with temperature is often ignored.\nMeasurement of pH of a solution is very \nessential as its value should be known when dealing with biological and cosmetic applications. The pH of a solution can be found roughly with the help of pH paper that has different colour in solutions of different pH. Now-a-days pH paper is available with four strips on it. The different strips have different colours (Fig. 6.11) at the same pH. The pH in the range of 1-14 can be determined with an accuracy of ~0.5 using pH paper. \nFig.6.11  pH-paper with four strips that may have \ndifferent colours at the same pH\nFor greater accuracy pH meters are used. \npH meter is a device that measures the  \npH-dependent electrical potential of the test \nsolution within 0.001 precision. pH meters of the size of a writing pen are now available in the market. The pH of some very common substances are given in Table 6.5 (page 195).\nProblem 6.16\nThe concentration of hydrogen ion in a \nsample of soft drink is 3.8 × 10\n–3M. what \nis its pH ?\nSolution\npH = – log[3.8 × 10–3] \n      = – {log[3.8] + log[10–3]}\n      = – {(0.58) + (– 3.0)} = – { – 2.42} = 2.42\nTherefore, the pH of the soft drink is 2.42 and it can be inferred that it is acidic.\nProblem 6.17  \nCalculate pH of a 1.0 × 10\n–8 M solution of \nHCl.\nUnit 6.indd   194 9/12/2022   11:58:28 AM\nReprint 2025-26\n\n195\nEQUILIBRIUM\nTable 6.6  The Ionization Constants of Some \nSelected Weak Acids (at 298K)\n Acid Ionization Constant,\n   Ka\nHydrofluoric Acid (HF)  3.5 × 10–4\nNitrous Acid (HNO2) 4.5 × 10–4\nFormic Acid (HCOOH)  1.8 × 10–4\nNiacin (C5H4NCOOH)  1.5 × 10–5\nAcetic Acid (CH3COOH)  1.74 × 10–5\nBenzoic Acid (C6H5COOH)  6.5 × 10–5\nHypochlorous Acid (HCIO)  3.0 × 10–8\nHydrocyanic Acid (HCN)  4.9 × 10–10\nPhenol (C6H5OH) 1.3 × 10–10Solution    \n2H2O (l)   H3O+ (aq)  +  OH–(aq) \nKw = [OH–][H3O+] \n     = 10–14\nLet, x = [OH–] = [H3O+] from H2O.

The \nequilibrium can be expressed by:\nHX(aq) + H2O(l)  H3O+(aq) + X–(aq)\nInitial \nconcentration (M)c                                0               0Let α be the extent of ionizationChange (M)\n \n-cα                 +c α               +c α\nEquilibrium concentration (M)  \nc-cα                  c α                c α \nHere, c = initial concentration \nof the \nundissociated acid, HX at time, t = 0. α = \nextent up to which HX is ionized into ions. \nUsing these notations, we can derive the equilibrium constant for the above discussed acid-dissociation equilibrium:\nK\na = c2α2 / c(1-α) = cα2 / 1-α\nKa is called the dissociation or ionization \nconstant  of acid HX. It can be represented \nalternatively in terms of molar concentration as follows,\n   Ka = [H+][X–] / [HX]          (6.30)\nAt a given temperature T , Ka is a \nmeasure of the strength of the acid HX i.e., larger the value of K\na, the stronger is the \nacid. Ka is a dimensionless quantity with \nthe understanding that the standard state concentration of all species is 1M.\nThe values of the ionization constants \nof some selected weak acids are given in  \nTable 6.6.Table 6.5  The pH of Some Common Substances\n Name of the Fluid  pH Name of the Fluid  pH\nSaturated solution of NaOH  ~15 Black Coffee  5.0\n0.1 M NaOH solution  13 Tomato juice  ~4.2\nLime water  10.5 Soft drinks and vinegar  ~3.0\nMilk of magnesia  10 Lemon juice  ~2.2 \nEgg white, sea water  7.8 Gastric juice  ~1.2\nHuman blood  7.4 1M HCl solution  ~0\nMilk  6.8 Concentrated HCl  ~–1.0\nHuman Saliva  6.4 \nThe pH scale for the hydrogen ion \nconcentration has been so useful that besides pK\nw, it has been extended to other species and \nUnit 6.indd   195 11/2/2022   4:11:08 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\n196\nchemistry\nquantities. Thus, we have:\npKa = –log (Ka)                                   (6.31)\nKnowing the ionization constant, Ka \nof an acid and its initial concentration, c, \nit is possible to calculate the equilibrium concentration of all species and also the \ndegree of ionization of the acid and the pH of \nthe solution.\nA general step-wise approach can be \nadopted to evaluate the pH of the weak electrolyte as follows:\nStep 1 .

The \nequilibrium constant for base ionization is called base ionization constant and is represented by K\nb. It can be expressed in \nterms of concentration in molarity of various species in equilibrium by the following equation:\nK\nb = [M+][OH–] / [MOH]          (6.33)\nAlternatively, if c = initial \nconcentration \nof base and α = degree of ionization of base \ni.e. the extent to which the base ionizes. When equilibrium is reached, the equilibrium constant can be written as:\nK\nb = (cα)2 / c (1- α) = c α2 / (1-α)\nThe values of the ionization constants of \nsome selected weak bases, Kb are given in  \nTable 6.7.\nMany organic compounds like amines  \nare weak bases. Amines are derivatives of \nammonia in which one or more hydrogen atoms are replaced by another group. For example, methylamine, codeine, quinine and \nUnit 6.indd   197 9/12/2022   11:58:28 AM\nReprint 2025-26\n\n198\nchemistry\nnicotine all behave as very weak bases due to \ntheir very small Kb. Ammonia produces OH– in \naqueous solution:\nNH3(aq) + H2O(l)   NH4+(aq) + OH–(aq)\nThe pH scale for the hydrogen ion \nconcentration has been extended to get:\npKb = –log ( Kb)             (6.34)\nProblem 6.21 \nThe pH of 0.004M hydrazine solution is 9.7. \nCalculate its ionization constant Kb and pKb.\nSolution \nNH2NH2  +  H2O   NH2NH3+   +   OH–\nFrom the pH we can calculate the hydrogen \nion concentration. Knowing hydrogen ion concentration and the ionic product of \nwater we can calculate the concentration \nof hydroxyl ions. Thus we have:\n[H\n+] = antilog (–pH) \n=  antilog (–9.7) = 1.67 ×10–10\n[OH–] = Kw / [H+] = 1 × 10–14 / 1.67 × 10–10 \n                  = 5.98 × 10–5\nThe concentration of the corresponding \nhydrazinium ion is also the same as that of hydroxyl ion. The concentration of both these ions is very small so the concentration of the undissociated base can be taken equal to 0.004M.\nThus,K\nb = [NH2NH3+][OH–] / [NH2NH2] \n= (5.98 × 10–5)2 / 0.004 = 8.96 × 10–7\npKb = –logKb = –log(8.96 × 10–7) = 6.04.\nProblem 6.22\nCalculate the pH of the solution in which  \n0.2M NH4Cl and 0.1M NH3 are present. The \npKb of ammonia solution is 4.75.\nSolution   \nNH3   +   H2O        NH4+     +      OH–\nThe ionization constant of NH3,         \nKb = antilog (–p Kb) i.e.Kb = 10–4.75 = 1.77 × 10–5 M\n         NH3   +   H2O       NH4+     +      OH–\nInitial concentration (M)\n        0.10         0.20          0\nChange to reach equilibrium (M)            –x                          +x                  +xAt equilibrium (M)           0.10 – x                 0.20 + x             xK\nb = [NH4+][OH–] / [NH3]\n = (0.20 + x)(x) / (0.1 – x) = 1.77 × 10–5\nAs Kb is small, we can neglect x in comparison \nto 0.1M and 0.2M. Thus,[OH\n–] = x = 0.88 × 10–5\nTherefore, [H+] = 1.12 × 10–9\npH = – log[H+] = 8.95.\n6.11.5  relation between Ka and Kb\nAs seen earlier in this chapter, Ka and Kb \nrepresent the strength of an acid and a base, \nrespectively. In case of a conjugate acid-base pair, they are related in a simple manner so that if one is known, the other can be deduced. Considering the example of NH\n4+ and NH3  \nwe see,\nNH4+(aq) + H2O(l)   H3O+(aq) + NH3(aq)\n  Ka = [H3O+][ NH3] / [NH4+] = 5.6 × 10–10\nNH3(aq) + H2O(l)    NH4+(aq) + OH–(aq)     \nKb =[ NH4+][ OH–] / NH3 = 1.8 × 10–5\nNet: 2 H2O(l)    H3O+(aq) + OH–(aq)            \nKw = [H3O+][ OH– ] = 1.0 × 10–14 M\nWhere, Ka represents the strength of NH4+ \nas an acid and Kb represents the strength of \nNH3 as a base.\nIt can be seen from the net reaction that \nthe equilibrium constant is equal to the \nproduct of equilibrium constants Ka and Kb \nfor the reactions added. Thus,\nKa × Kb = {[H3O+][ NH3] / [NH4+ ]} × {[NH4+]\n                                         [OH–] / [NH3]}\n= [H3O+][OH–] = Kw\n= (5.6 ×10–10) × (1.8 × 10–5) = 1.0 × 10–14 M\nUnit 6.indd   198 9/12/2022   11:58:28 AM\nReprint 2025-26\n\n199\nEQUILIBRIUM\nThis can be extended to make a \ngeneralisation. the equil\nibrium constant \nfor a net reaction obtained after adding \ntwo (or more) reactions equals the product of the equilibrium constants for individual reactions:\nK\nNET = K1 × K2 × ……                                   (6.35)\nSimilarly, in case of a conjugate acid-base \npair,\nKa × Kb = Kw                                                             (6.36)\nKnowing one, the other can be obtained. \nIt should be noted that a strong acid will have a weak conjugate base and vice-versa.\nAlternatively, the above expression  \nK\nw = Ka × Kb, can also be obtained by \nconsidering the base-dissociation equilibrium reaction:\nB(aq) + H\n2O(l)         BH+(aq) + OH–(aq)\nKb = [BH+][OH–] / [B] \nAs the concentration of water remains \nconstant it has been omitted from the denominator and incorporated within the dissociation constant. Then multiplying and dividing the above expression by [H\n+], we get:\nKb = [BH+][OH–][H+] / [B][H+] \n     ={[ OH–][H+]}{[BH+] / [B][H+]}\n    = Kw / Ka\nor  Ka × Kb = Kw\nIt may be noted that if we take negative \nlogarithm of both sides of the equation, then \npK values of the conjugate acid and base are related to each other by the equation:\npK\na + pKb = pKw = 14 (at 298K)\nProblem 6.23 \nDetermine the degree of ionization and pH of \na 0.05M of ammonia solution. The ionization constant of ammonia can be taken from Table 6.7. Also, calculate the ionization constant of the conjugate acid of ammonia.\nSolution \nThe ionization of NH\n3 in water is represented \nby equation:NH3  +  H2O           NH4+    +    OH–\nWe use equation (6.33) to calculate \nhydroxyl ion concentration,\n[OH–] = c α = 0.05 α \nKb = 0.05 α2 / (1 –  α)\nThe value of α  is small, therefore the \nquadratic equation can be simplified by \nneglecting α in comparison to 1 in the \ndenominator on right hand side of the equation,\nThus,K\nb = c α2  or   α = √ (1.77 × 10–5 / 0.05)\n                 = 0.018.\n[OH–] = c α = 0.05 × 0.018 = 9.4 × 10–4M.\n[H+] = Kw / [OH–] = 10–14 / (9.4 × 10–4) \n                          = 1.06 × 10–11\npH = –log(1.06 × 10–11) = 10.97.\nNow, using the relation for conjugate \nacid-base pair,\nKa × Kb = Kw\nusing the value of Kb of NH3 from  \nTable 6.7.We can determine the concentration of \nconjugate acid NH\n4+\nKa = Kw / Kb = 10–14 / 1.77 × 10–5 \n                    = 5.64 × 10–10.\n6.11.6  Di- and Polybasic Acids and Di- \nand Polyacidic bases\nSome of the acids like oxalic acid, sulphuric acid and phosphoric acids have more than one ionizable proton\n per molecule of the \nacid. Such acids are known as polybasic or polyprotic acids.\nThe ionization reactions for example for \na dibasic acid H\n2X are represented by the \nequations:\nH2X(aq)  H+(aq) + HX–(aq)\nHX–(aq)  H+(aq) + X2–(aq)\nAnd the corresponding equilibrium \nconstants are given below:\nKa1= {[H+][HX–]} / [H2X] and\nUnit 6.indd   199 9/12/2022   11:58:28 AM\nReprint 2025-26\n\n200\nchemistry\nKa2 = {[H+][X2-]} / [HX-]\nHere, Ka1and Ka2are called the first and second \nionization constants respectively of the acid H2 \nX. Similarly, for tribasic acids like H3PO4 we \nhave three ionization constants. The values \nof the ionization constants for some common polyprotic acids are given in Table 6.8.In general, when strength of H-A bond \ndecreases, that is, the energy required to break the bond decreases, HA becomes a stronger acid. Also, when the H-A bond becomes more polar i.e., the electronegativity difference between the atoms H and A increases and there is marked charge separation, cleavage of the bond becomes easier thereby increasing the acidity.\nBut it should be noted that while comparing \nelements in the same group of the periodic table, H-A bond strength is a more important factor in determining acidity than its polar nature. As the size of A increases down the group, H-A bond strength decreases and so the acid strength increases. For example,\nSize increases\nHF << HCl << HBr << HI\nAcid strength increases\nSimilarly, H\n2S is stronger acid than H2O.\nBut, when we discuss elements in the same \nrow of the periodic table, H-A bond polarity becomes the deciding factor for determining the acid strength. As the electronegativity of A increases, the strength of the acid also increases. For example,\nElectronegativity of A increases\nCH\n4 < NH3 < H2O < HF\nAcid strength increases\n6.11.8  Common ion Effect in the \nionization of Acids and bases\nConsider an example of acetic acid dissociation equilibrium represented as:\nCH\n3COOH(aq)   H+(aq) +  CH3COO– (aq) \nor  HAc(aq)   H+ (aq) + Ac– (aq)\nKa = [H+][Ac– ] / [HAc]\nAddition of acetate ions to an acetic \nacid solution results in decreasing the concentration of hydrogen ions, [H\n+]. Also, \nif H+ ions are added from an external source \nthen the equilibrium moves in the direction of undissociated acetic acid i.e., in a direction of reducing the concentration of hydrogen ions, [H\n+]. This phenomenon is an example table 6.8  the ionization Constants of Some \nCommon Polyprotic Acids (298K)\nIt can be seen that higher order ionization \nconstants (Ka2, Ka3) are smaller than the \nlower order ionization constant (Ka1) of a \npolyprotic acid. The reason for this is that \nit is more difficult to remove a positively charged proton from a negative ion due to electrostatic forces. This can be seen in the case of removing a proton from the uncharged H\n2CO3 as compared from a negatively charged \nHCO3–. Similarly, it is more difficult to remove \na proton from a doubly charged HPO42– anion \nas compared to H2PO4–. \nPolyprotic acid solutions contain a \nmixture of acids like H2A, HA– and A2– in case \nof a diprotic acid. H2A being a strong acid, the \nprimary reaction involves the dissociation of H\n2 A, and H3O+ in the solution comes mainly \nfrom the first dissociation step.\n6.11.7  Factors Affecting Acid Strength\nHaving discussed quantitatively the strengths \nof acids and bases, \nwe come to a stage where \nwe can calculate the pH of a given acid solution. But, the curiosity rises about why should some acids be stronger than others? What factors are responsible for making them stronger? The answer lies in its being a complex phenomenon. But, broadly speaking we can say that the extent of dissociation of an acid depends on the strength and polarity  \nof the H-A bond.\nUnit 6.indd   200 9/12/2022   11:58:28 AM\nReprint 2025-26\n\n201\nEQUILIBRIUM\nof common ion effect. It can be defined as \na shift in equilibrium on adding a substance \nthat provides more of an ionic species already present in the dissociation equilibrium. Thus, we can say that common ion effect is a phenomenon based on the Le Chatelier’s principle discussed in section 6.8.\nIn order to evaluate the pH of the solution \nresulting on addition of 0.05M acetate ion to 0.05M acetic acid solution, we shall consider the acetic acid dissociation equilibrium once again,\n HAc(aq)  H+(aq)   +  Ac–(aq)\nInitial concentration (M)\n    0.05      0         0.05  \nLet x be the extent of ionization of acetic \nacid.\nChange in concentration (M)  \n     –x       +x          +xEquilibrium concentration (M) 0.05-x      x      0.05+xTherefore, \nK\na= [H+][Ac– ]/[H Ac] = {(0.05+x)(x)}/(0.05-x)\nAs Ka is small for a very weak acid, x<<0.05. \nHence, (0.05 + x) ≈ (0.05 – x) ≈  0.05\nThus, 1.8 × 10\n–5 = (x) (0.05 + x) / (0.05 – x) \n= x(0.05) / (0.05) = x = [H+] = 1.8 × 10–5M\npH = – log(1.8 × 10–5) = 4.74\nProblem 6.24 \nCalculate the pH of a 0.10M ammonia \nsolution. Calculate the pH after 50.0 mL of this solution is treated with 25.0 mL of 0.10M HCl.

The resulting 75 mL solution contains the remaining unneutralized 2.5 mmol of NH\n3 molecules \nand 2.5 mmol of NH4+.\nNH3    +    HCl    →    NH4+ +  Cl–\n2.5           2.5              0          0\nAt equilibrium 0              0             2.5         2.5The resulting 75 mL of solution contains \n2.5 mmol of NH\n4+ ions (i.e.,  0.033 M) and \n2.5 mmol (i.e.,  0.033 M ) of uneutralised NH\n3 molecules. This NH3 exists in the \nfollowing equilibrium:\nNH4OH      NH4+   +     OH–\n0.033M – y               y              ywhere, y  =  [OH\n–]  =  [NH4+]\nThe final 75 mL solution after \nneutralisation already contains  \n2.5 m mol NH4+ ions (i.e. 0.033M), thus \ntotal concentration of NH4+ ions is given \nas:\n[NH4+] = 0.033 + y\nAs y is small, [NH4OH]  0.033 M and \n[NH4+]  0.033M.\nWe know,K\nb = [NH4+][OH–] / [NH4OH] \n     = y (0.033)/(0.033) = 1.77 × 10–5 M\nThus, y = 1.77 × 10–5 = [OH–]\n[H+] = 10–14 / 1.77 × 10–5 = 0.56 × 10–9\nHence, pH = 9.24\n6.11.9  Hydrolysis of Salts and the pH of \ntheir Solutions\nSalts formed by the reactions between acids and bases in \ndefinite proportions, undergo \nionization in water. The cations/anions \nUnit 6.indd   201 9/12/2022   11:58:29 AM\nReprint 2025-26\n\n202\nchemistry\nformed on ionization of salts either exist as \nhydrated ions in aqueous solutions or interact with water to reform corresponding acids/bases depending upon the nature of salts. The later process of interaction between water and cations/anions or both of salts is called hydrolysis. The pH of the solution gets affected by this interaction. The cations (e.g., Na\n+, K+, Ca2+, Ba2+, etc.) of strong bases \nand anions (e.g., Cl–, Br–, NO3–, ClO4– etc.) of \nstrong acids simply get hydrated but do not hydrolyse, and therefore the solutions of salts formed from strong acids and bases are neutral i.e., their pH is 7. However, the other category of salts do undergo hydrolysis.\nWe now consider the hydrolysis of the \nsalts of the following types :\n(i)\n salts of weak acid and strong base e.g., \nCH3COONa.\n(ii) salts of strong acid and weak base e.g., NH\n4Cl, and\n(iii) salts of weak acid and weak base, e.g., CH\n3COONH4.\nIn the first case, CH3COONa being a salt of \nweak acid, CH3COOH and strong base, NaOH \ngets completely ionised in aqueous solution.\nCH3COONa(aq)   →  CH3COO– (aq)+  Na+(aq)\nAcetate ion thus formed undergoes \nhydrolysis in water to give acetic acid and \nOH– ions\nCH3COO–(aq)+H2O(l) CH3COOH(aq)+OH–(aq)\nAcetic acid being a weak acid  \n(Ka = 1.8 × 10–5) remains mainly unionised in \nsolution. This results in increase of OH– ion \nconcentration in solution making it alkaline. The pH of such a solution is more than 7.\nSimilarly, NH\n4Cl formed from weak \nbase, NH4OH and strong acid, HCl, in water \ndissociates completely.\nNH4Cl(aq) → NH+\n4(aq)  +Cl– (aq)\nAmmonium ions undergo hydrolysis with \nwater to form NH4OH and H+ ions\nNH+\n4 (aq) + H2O (1)  NH4OH(aq) + H+(aq) \nAmmonium hydroxide is a weak base  \n(Kb = 1.77 × 10–5) and therefore remains \nalmost unionised in solution. This results in increased of H+ ion concentration in solution \nmaking the solution acidic. Thus, the pH of \nNH4Cl solution in water is less than 7.\nConsider the hydrolysis of CH3COONH4 \nsalt formed from weak acid and weak base. The ions formed undergo hydrolysis as follow:\nCH\n3COO– + NH4+ +  H2O   CH3COOH +          \n           \n                                                    NH4OH\nCH3COOH and NH4OH, also remain into \npartially dissociated form:\nCH3COOH         CH3COO–  +  H+\nNH4OH           NH4+    +   OH–\nH2O          H+  +  OH–\nWithout going into detailed calculation, \nit can be said that degree of hydrolysis is \nindependent of concentration of solution, and \npH of such solutions is determined by their pK values: \n pH = 7 + ½ (pKa – pKb)                             (6.38)\nThe pH of solution can be greater than 7, \nif the difference is positive and it will be less than 7, if the difference is negative.\nProblem 6.25\nThe pK\na of acetic acid and pKb of ammonium \nhydroxide are 4.76 and 4.75 respectively. \nCalculate the pH of ammonium acetate solution.\nSolution\npH = 7 + ½ [p K\na – pKb]\n       = 7 + ½ [4.76 – 4.75]\n       = 7 + ½ [0.01]  = 7 + 0.005  = 7.005\n6.12 bUFFE r SOlUtiOnS\nMany body fluids \ne.g., blood or urine have \ndefinite pH and any deviation in their pH \nindicates malfunctioning of the body.

A mixture of acetic acid and sodium acetate acts as buffer solution around pH 4.75 and a mixture of ammonium chloride and ammonium hydroxide acts as a buffer around pH 9.25. You will learn more about \nbuffer solutions in higher classes.\n6.12.1\n Designing buffer Solution \nKnowledge of pKa, pKb and equilibrium \nconstant help us to prepare the buffer solution \nof known pH. Let us see how we can do this.\nPreparation of Acidic buffer \nTo prepare a buffer of  acidic pH we \nuse weak \nacid and its salt formed with strong base. \nWe develop the equation relating the pH, the equilibrium constant, K\na  of weak acid and \nratio of concentration of weak acid and its conjugate base. For \nthe general case where \nthe weak acid HA ionises in water, \nHA + H2O  H3O+ + A–\nFor which we can write the expression\nRearranging the expression we have,\nTaking logarithm on both the sides and \nrearranging the terms we get —\n              Or\n                    (6.39)\n    \n(6.40) \nThe expression (6.40) is known \nas \nHenderson–Hasselbalch equation. The \nquantity  is the ratio of concentration \nof conjugate base (anion) of the acid and the acid present in the mixture. Since acid is a \nweak acid, it ionises to a very little extent and concentration of [HA] is negligibly different from concentration of acid taken to form buffer. Also, most of the conjugate base, [A\n—], \ncomes from the ionisation of salt of the acid. Therefore, the concentration of conjugate base will be negligibly different from the concentration of salt. Thus, equation (6.40) takes the form:\n \npp Ka H=[Salt]\n[Acid]+log\nIn the equation (6.39), if the concentration \nof [A—] is equal to the concentration of [HA], \nthen pH = pKa because value of log 1 is zero. \nThus if we take molar concentration of acid \nand salt (conjugate base) same, the pH of the buffer solution will be equal to the pK\na of the \nacid. So for preparing the buffer solution of the required pH we select that acid whose pK\na \nis close to the required pH. For acetic acid pK\na value is 4.76, therefore pH of the buffer \nsolution formed by acetic acid and sodium acetate taken in equal molar concentration will be around 4.76.\nA similar analysis of a buffer made with \na weak base and its conjugate acid leads to \nthe result,\n      \npOH= p+ log[Conju gate acid ,BH+]\n  [Base, B]bK   \n(6.41) \npH of the buffer solution can be calculated\n \nby using the equation pH + pOH =14.\nWe know that pH + pOH = pKw  and  \npKa + pKb = pKw. On putting these values in \nequation (6.41) it takes the form as follows: \np-  pH=pp[Conjuga teacid ,BH]\n  [Base,B]wwKK Ka /unif02d/unif02b/unif02b\nlog\n                           or       \npH=p[Conjuga teacid ,BH]\n  [Base,B]Ka++\nlog\n    (6.42)\nIf molar concentration of base and its \nconjugate acid (cation) is same then pH of \nthe buffer solution will be same as pKa for the \nbase. pKa value for ammonia is s9.25; therefore \na buffer of pH close to 9.25 can be obtained by taking ammonia solution and ammonium \nUnit 6.indd   203 9/12/2022   11:58:29 AM\nReprint 2025-26\n\n204\nchemistry\nchloride solution of same molar concentration. \nFor a buffer solution formed by ammonium chloride and ammonium hydroxide, equation  \n(6.42) becomes:\n  pH=[Conju gateacid ,BH]\n  [Base,B]925.l og++\n                 \npH of the buffer solution is not affected by \ndilution because ratio under the logarithmic \nterm remains unchanged. \n6.13 SOlUbilit Y EqUilibri A OF \nSPArinGlY SOlUblE SAltS\nWe have already known that the solubility of \nionic solids in water varies a great deal. Some of\n \nthese (like calcium chloride) are so soluble that they are hygroscopic in nature and even absorb water vapour from atmosphere. Others (such as lithium fluoride) have so little solubility that they are commonly termed as insoluble. The solubility depends on a number of factors important amongst which are the lattice enthalpy of the salt and the solvation enthalpy of the ions in a solution. For a salt to dissolve in a solvent the strong forces of attraction between its ions (lattice enthalpy) must be overcome by the ion-solvent interactions. The solvation enthalpy of ions is referred to in terms of solvation which is always negative i.e. energy is released in the process of solvation. The amount of solvation enthalpy depends on the nature of the solvent. In case of a non-polar (covalent) solvent, solvation enthalpy is small and hence, not sufficient to overcome lattice enthalpy of the salt. Consequently, the salt does not dissolve in non-polar solvent. As a general rule, for a salt to be able to dissolve in a particular solvent its solvation enthalpy must be greater than its lattice enthalpy so that the latter may be overcome by former. Each salt has its characteristic solubility which depends on temperature. We classify salts on the basis of their solubility in the following three categories.\n Category I     Soluble    Solubility > 0.1M\n Category II    Slightly    0.01M<Solubility< 0.1M\n                      Soluble \n Category III   Sparingly  Solubility < 0.01M                      \nSolubleWe shall now consider the equilibrium \nbetween the sparingly soluble ionic salt and \nits saturated aqueous solution.\n6.13.1  Solubility Product Constant\nLet us now have a solid like barium sulphate \nin contact with its \nsaturated aqueous solution. \nThe equilibrium between the undisolved solid and the ions in a saturated solution can be  represented by the equation:\nBaSO\n4(s)    Ba2+(aq) + SO42–(aq),\nThe equilibrium constant is given by the \nequation:\nK = {[Ba2+][SO42–]} / [BaSO4]\nFor a pure solid substance the \nconcentration remains constant and we can \nwrite\nKsp = K[BaSO4] = [Ba2+][SO42–]           (6.43)\nWe call Ksp the solubility product constant \nor simply solubility product. The experimental value of K\nsp in above equation at 298K is  \n1.1 × 10–10. This means that for solid barium \nsulphate in equilibrium with its saturated solution, the product of the concentrations of barium and sulphate ions is equal to its solubility product constant. The concentrations of the two ions will be equal to the molar solubility of the barium sulphate. If molar solubility is S, then \n1.1 × 10\n–10 = (S)(S) = S2 \nor                       S = 1.05 × 10–5.\nThus, molar solubility of barium sulphate \nwill be equal to 1.05 × 10–5 mol L–1.\nA salt may give on dissociation two or \nmore than two anions and cations carrying \ndifferent charges. For example, consider a salt like zirconium phosphate of molecular formula \n(Zr\n4+)3(PO43–)4. It dissociates into 3 zirconium \ncations of charge +4 and 4 phosphate anions of charge –3. If the molar solubility of zirconium phosphate is S, then it can be seen from the stoichiometry of the compound that\n[Zr\n4+] = 3S and [PO43–] = 4S \nand Ksp = (3S)3 (4S)4 = 6912 (S)7\nor S = {Ksp / (33 × 44)}1/7 = (Ksp / 6912)1/7\nUnit 6.indd   204 9/12/2022   11:58:30 AM\nReprint 2025-26\n\n205\nEQUILIBRIUM\nA solid salt of the general formula MXxp\nyq /unif02b/unif02d\nwith molar solubility S in equilibrium with \nits saturated solution may be represented by the equation:\nM\nxXy(s)          xMp+(aq) + yXq– (aq)\n(where x × p+ = y × q–)\nAnd its solubility product constant is \ngiven by:\nKsp   = [Mp+]x[Xq– ]y = (xS)x(yS)y      (6.44) \n       = xx . yy .

Obviously under equilibrium conditions K\nsp = Qsp but otherwise it gives the \ndirection of the processes of precipitation or dissolution. The solubility product constants of a number of common salts at 298K are \ngiven in Table 6.9.table 6.9  the Solubility Product Constants, \nKsp of Some Common ionic Salts at \n298K.\nProblem 6.26\nCalculate the solubility of A2X3 in pure \nwater, assuming that neither kind of ion \nreacts with water. The solubility product of A\n2X3, Ksp = 1.1 × 10–23.\nSolution\nA2X3 → 2A3+ + 3X2–\nKsp = [A3+]2 [X2–]3 = 1.1 × 10–23\nIf  S = solubility of A2X3, then\n[A3+] = 2S;  [X2–] = 3S\ntherefore, Ksp = (2S)2(3S)3 = 108S5 \n                                        = 1.1 × 10–23\nthus, S5 = 1 × 10–25\nS = 1.0 × 10–5 mol/L.\nProblem 6.27\nThe values of Ksp of two sparingly soluble \nsalts Ni(OH)2 and AgCN are 2.0 × 10–15 and \n6 × 0–17 respectively.

Similarly, if the concentration of one of \nthe ions is decreased, more salt will dissolve to increase the concentration of both the ions till once again K\nsp = Qsp. This is applicable \neven to soluble salts like sodium chloride except that due to higher concentrations of the ions, we use their activities instead of their molarities in the expression for Q\nsp. Thus if we take a saturated solution of \nsodium chloride and pass HCl gas through it, then sodium chloride is precipitated due to increased concentration (activity) of chloride ion available from the dissociation of HCl. Sodium chloride thus obtained is of very high purity and we can get rid of impurities like sodium and magnesium sulphates. The common ion effect is also used for almost complete precipitation of a particular ion as its sparingly soluble salt, with very low value of solubility product for gravimetric estimation. Thus we can precipitate silver ion as silver chloride, ferric ion as its hydroxide (or hydrated ferric oxide) and barium ion as its sulphate for quantitative estimations.Dissolution of S mol/L of Ni(OH)\n2 provides \nS mol/L of Ni2+ and 2S mol/L of OH–, but \nthe total concentration of OH– = (0.10 + 2S) \nmol/L because the solution already contains \n0.10 mol/L of OH– from NaOH.\nKsp = 2.0 × 10–15 = [Ni2+] [OH–]2 \n                         = (S) (0.10 + 2S)2\nAs Ksp is small, 2S << 0.10, \nthus, (0.10 + 2S) ≈ 0.10\nHence,2.0 × 10\n–15 = S (0.10)2\nS = 2.0 × 10–13 M = [Ni2+]\nProblem 6.28\nCalculate the molar solubility of Ni(OH)2 in \n0.10 M NaOH. The ionic product of Ni(OH)2 \nis 2.0 × 10–15.\nSolutionLet the solubility of Ni(OH)\n2 be equal to S. The solubility of salts of weak acids like \nphosphates increases at lower pH. This is \nbecause at lower pH the concentration of the anion decreases due to its protonation. This in turn increase the solubility of the salt so that K\nsp = Qsp. We have to satisfy two equilibria \nsimultaneously i.e.,\nKsp = [M+] [X–],\n                          \n [X–] / [HX] = Ka/[H+] \nTaking inverse of both side and adding 1 \nwe get\nHX\nXH\nHX H\nXHa\na\na/unif05b/unif05d\n/unif0e9/unif0eb/unif0f9/unif0fb/unif02b/unif03d/unif0e9/unif0eb/unif0f9/unif0fb/unif02b\n/unif05b/unif05d /unif02b/unif0e9/unif0eb/unif0f9/unif0fb\n/unif0e9\n/unif0eb/unif0f9/unif0fb/unif03d/unif0e9/unif0eb/unif0f9/unif0fb/unif02b/unif02d/unif02b\n/unif02d\n/unif02d/unif02b11K\nK\nK\nNow, again taking inverse, we get\n[X–] / {[X–] + [HX]} = f = Ka/(Ka + [H+]) and it \ncan be seen that ‘f’ decreases as pH decreases. \nIf S is the solubility of the salt at a given  \npH then \nKsp = [S] [f S] = S2 {Ka/(Ka + [H+])} and\nS = {Ksp ([H+] + Ka)/Ka}1/2    (6.46)\nThus solubility S increases with increase \nin [H+] or decrease in pH. \nUnit 6.indd   206 9/12/2022   11:58:30 AM\nReprint 2025-26\n\n207\nEQUILIBRIUM\nSUmmArY\nWhen the number of molecules leaving the liquid to vapour equals the number of molecules \nreturning to the liquid from vapour, equilibrium is said to be attained and is dynamic in nature. Equilibrium can be established for both physical and chemical processes and at this stage rate of forward and reverse reactions are equal. Equilibrium constant, K\nc is \nexpressed as the concentration of products divided by reactants, each term raised to the stoichiometric coefficient.\nFor reaction, a A + b B        c C +d D\nK\nc = [C]c[D]d/[A]a[B]b\nEquilibrium constant has constant value at a fixed temperature and at this stage all the \nmacroscopic properties such as concentration, pressure, etc. become constant. For a gaseous reaction equilibrium constant is expressed as K\np and is written by replacing concentration \nterms by partial pressures in Kc expression. The direction of reaction can be predicted by \nreaction quotient Qc which is equal to Kc at equilibrium. le Chatelier’s principle states that \nthe change in any factor such as temperature, pressure, concentration, etc. will \ncause the \nequilibrium to shift in such a direction so as to reduce or counteract the effect of the change. It can be used to study the effect of various factors such as temperature, concentration, pressure, catalyst and inert gases on the direction of equilibrium and to control the yield of products by controlling these factors. Catalyst does not effect the equilibrium composition of a reaction mixture but increases the rate of chemical reaction by making available a new lower energy pathway for conversion of reactants to products and vice-versa.\nAll substances that conduct electricity in aqueous solutions are called electrolytes. Acids, \nbases and salts are electrolytes and the conduction of electricity by their aqueous solutions is due to anions and cations produced by the dissociation or ionization of electrolytes \nin aqueous solution. The strong electrolytes are completely dissociated. In weak electrolytes there is equilibrium between the ions and the unionized electrolyte molecules. According to Arrhenius, acids give hydrogen ions while bases produce hydroxyl ions in their aqueous solutions. \nbrönsted- lowry on \nthe other hand, defined an acid as a proton donor and a base as \na proton acceptor. When a Brönsted-Lowry acid reacts with a base, it produces its conjugate base and a conjugate acid corresponding to the base with which it reacts. Thus a conjugate pair of acid-base differs only by one proton. \nlewis further \ngeneralised the definition of an \nacid as an electron pair acceptor and a base as an electron pair donor. The expressions for ionization (equilibrium) constants of weak acids (K\na) and weak bases (Kb) are developed \nusing Arrhenius definition. The degree of ionization and its dependence on concentration and common ion are discussed. The pH scale (pH = –log[H\n+]) for the hydrogen ion concentration \n(activity) has been introduced and extended to other quantities (pOH = – log[OH–]); pKa = –log[Ka];  \npKb = –log[Kb]; and pKw = –log[Kw] etc.). The ionization of water has been considered and we \nnote that the equation: pH + pOH = pKw is always satisfied. The salts of strong acid and \nweak base, weak acid and strong base, and weak acid and weak base undergo hydrolysis in aqueous solution. The definition of buffer solutions,  and their importance are discussed \nbriefly. The solubility equilibrium of sparingly soluble salts is discussed and the equilibrium constant is introduced as solubility product constant  (K\nsp). Its relationship with solubility \nof the salt is established. The conditions of precipitation of the salt from their solutions or their dissolution in water are worked out. The role of common ion and the solubility of sparingly soluble salts is also discussed.\nUnit 6.indd   207 9/12/2022   11:58:31 AM\nReprint 2025-26\n\n208\nchemistry\nSUGGES tED AC tiVitiES FO r StUDEntS rEGArDinG tHiS Unit\n(a) The student may use pH paper in determini ng the pH of fresh juices of various vegetables \nand fruits, soft drinks, body fluids and also that of water samples available.\n(b) The pH paper may also be used to determine the pH of different salt solutions and from \nthat he/she may determine if these are formed from strong/weak acids and bases.\n(c) They may prepare some buffer \nsolutions by mixing the solutions of sodium acetate and \nacetic acid and determine their pH using pH paper.\n(d) They may be provided with different \nindicators to observe their colours in solutions of \nvarying pH.\n(e) They may perform some acid-base titrations using indicators.\n(f) They may observe common ion effect on the solubility of sparingly soluble salts.    \n(g) If pH meter is available in their school, they may measure the pH with it and compare the results obtained with that of the pH paper.\nEXErCiSES\n6.1 A liquid is in equilibrium with its vapour in a sealed container at a fixed temperature.The volume of the container is suddenly increased.\na)\n What is the initial effect of the change on vapour pressure?\nb) How do rates of evaporation and condensation change initially?\nc) What happens when equilibrium \nis restored finally and what will be the final vapour \npressure? \n6.2 What is Kc for the following equilibrium when the equilibrium concentration of each \nsubstance is: [SO2]= 0.60M, [O2] = 0.82M and [SO3] = 1.90M ?\n2SO2(g) + O2(g)    2SO3(g)\n6.3 At a certain temperature \nand total pressure of 105Pa, iodine vapour contains 40% by \nvolume of I atoms\nI2 (g)    2I (g)\n Calculate Kp for the equilibrium.\n6.4 Write the expression for the equilibrium constant, Kc for each of the following reactions:\n (i) 2NOCl (g)    2NO (g) + Cl2 (g)\n (ii) 2Cu(NO3)2 (s)    2CuO (s) + 4NO2 (g) + O2 (g)\n (iii) CH3COOC2H5(aq) + H2O(l)    CH3COOH (aq) + C2H5OH (aq)\n (iv) Fe3+ (aq) + 3OH– (aq)    Fe(OH)3 (s)\n (v) I2 (s) + 5F2    2IF5\n6.5 Find out the value of Kc for each of the following equilibria from the value of Kp:\n (i)  2NOCl (g)    2NO (g) + Cl2 (g);  Kp= 1.8 × 10–2 at 500 K\n (ii) CaCO3 (s)    CaO(s) + CO2(g);  Kp= 167 at 1073 K\nUnit 6.indd   208 9/12/2022   11:58:31 AM\nReprint 2025-26\n\n209\nEQUILIBRIUM\n6.6 For the following equilibrium, Kc= 6.3 × 1014 at 1000 K \n NO (g) + O3 (g)     NO2 (g) + O2 (g)\n  Both the forward and reverse reactions in the equilibrium are elementary bimolecular  \n reactions.
