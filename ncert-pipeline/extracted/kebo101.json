Mayr joined Harvard’s Faculty of Arts\nand Sciences in 1953 and retired in 1975, assuming the title\nAlexander Agassiz Professor of Zoology Emeritus . Throughout\nhis nearly 80-year car eer, his r esear ch spanned or nithology,\ntaxonomy, zoogeography, evolution, systematics, and the\nhistory and philosophy of biology. He almost single-handedly\nmade the origin of species diversity the central question of\nevolutionary biology that it is today. He also pioneered the\ncurrently accepted definition of a biological species. Mayr was\nawarded the three prizes widely regarded as the triple crown of\nbiology: the Balzan Prize in 1983, the International Prize for\nBiology in 1994, and the Crafoord Prize in 1999. Mayr died at\nthe age of 100 in the year 2004.\nErnst Mayr\n(1904 – 2004)\nReprint 2025-26\n\nHow wonderful is the living world! The wide range of living types is\namazing. The extraordinary habitats in which we find living organisms,\nbe it cold mountains, deciduous forests, oceans, fresh water lakes, deserts\nor hot springs, leave us speechless. The beauty of a galloping horse, of\nthe migrating birds, the valley of flowers or the attacking shark evokes\nawe and a de ep sense of wonder . The ecological conflict and co operation\namong members of a population and among populations of a community\nor even the molecular traffic inside a cell make us deeply reflect on – what\nindeed is life? This question has two implicit questions within it. The first\nis a technical one and seeks answer to what living is as opposed to the\nnon-living, and the second is a philosophical one, and seeks answer to\nwhat the purpose of life is. As scientists, we shall not attempt answering\nthe second question. W e will try to reflect on – what is living?\n1.1DIVERSITY  IN THE LIVING WORLD\nIf you look around you will see a large variety of living organisms, be it\npotted plants, insects, birds, your pets or other animals and plants. There\nare also several organisms that you cannot see with your naked eye but\nthey are all around you. If you were to increase the area that you make\nobservations in, the range and variety of organisms that you see would\nincrease. Obviously, if you were to visit a dense forest, you would probably\nsee a much greater number and kinds of living organisms in it. Each\ndifferent kind of plant, animal or organism that you see, represents a\nspecies. The number of species that are known and described range\nbetween 1.7-1.8 million. This refers to biodiversity  or the number andTHE LIVING WORLDCHAPTER   1\n1.1Diversity in the\nLiving W orld\n1.2Taxonomic\nCategories\nReprint 2025-26\n\n4 BIOLOGY\ntypes of or ganisms pr esent on earth. W e should r emember her e that as\nwe explore new areas, and even old ones, new organisms are continuously\nbeing identified.\nAs stated earlier , ther e are millions of plants and animals in the world;\nwe know the plants and animals in our own area by their local names.\nThese local names would vary from place to place, even within a country.\nProbably you would recognise the confusion that would be created if we\ndid not find ways and means to talk to each other , to refer to organisms\nwe are talking about.\nHence, there is a need to standardise the naming of living organisms\nsuch that a particular organism is known by the same name all over the\nworld. This process is called nomenclature . Obviously, nomenclature\nor naming is only possible when the organism is described correctly and\nwe know to what organism the name is attached to. This is identification.\nIn order to facilitate the study, number of scientists have established\nprocedures to assign a scientific name to each known organism.  This is\nacceptable to biologists all over the world. For plants, scientific names are\nbased on agreed principles and criteria, which are provided in International\nCode for Botanical Nomenclatur e (ICBN). Y ou may ask, how  ar e animals\nnamed? Animal taxonomists have evolved International Code of Zoological\nNomenclature (ICZN). The scientific names ensure that each organism\nhas only one name. Description of any organism should enable the people\n(in any part of the world) to arrive at the same name. They also ensure\nthat such a name has not been used for any other known organism.\nBiologists follow universally accepted principles to provide scientific\nnames to known organisms.  Each name has two components – the\nGeneric name  and the specific  epithet . This system of providing a\nname with two components is called Binomial nomenclature . This\nnaming system given by Carolus Linnaeus is being practised by biologists\nall over the world. This naming system using a two word format was\nfound convenient. Let us take the example of mango to understand the\nway of pr oviding scientific names better . The scientific name of mango is\nwritten as Mangifera indica . Let us see how it is a binomial name.  In this\nname Mangifera represents the genus while indica,  is a particular species,\nor a specific epithet. Other universal rules of nomenclature are as follows:\n1.Biological names are generally in Latin and written in italics.\nThey are Latinised or derived from Latin irrespective of their\norigin.\n2.The first word in a biological name represents the genus while\nthe second component denotes the specific epithet.\n3.Both the words in a biological name, when handwritten, are\nseparately underlined, or printed in italics to indicate their Latin\norigin.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nTHE LIVING W ORLD 5\n4.The first word denoting the genus starts with a capital letter\nwhile the specific epithet starts with a small letter . It can be\nillustrated with the example of \nMangifera indica .\nName of the author appears after the specific epithet, i.e., at the end of\nthe biological name and is written in an abbreviated form, e.g., Mangifera\nindica Linn. It indicates that this species was first described by Linnaeus.\nSince it is nearly impossible to study all the living organisms, it is\nnecessary to devise some means to make this possible. This process is\nclassification . Classification is the process by which anything is grouped\ninto convenient categories based on some easily observable characters.\nFor example, we easily recognise groups such as plants or animals or\ndogs, cats or insects. The moment we use any of these terms, we associate\ncertain characters with the organism in that group. What image do you\nsee when you think of a dog ? Obviously, each one of us will see ‘dogs’\nand not ‘cats’. Now, if we were to think of ‘Alsatians’ we know what we are\ntalking about. Similarly, suppose we were to say ‘mammals’, you would,\nof course, think of animals with exter nal ears and body hair . Likewise, in\nplants, if we try to talk of ‘Wheat’, the picture in each of our minds will be\nof wheat plants, not of rice or any other plant. Hence, all these - ‘Dogs’,\n‘Cats’, ‘Mammals’, ‘Wheat’, ‘Rice’, ‘Plants’, ‘Animals’, etc., are convenient\ncategories we use to study organisms. The scientific term for these\ncategories is taxa. Here you must recognise that taxa can indicate\ncategories at very different levels. ‘Plants’ – also form a taxa. ‘Wheat’ is\nalso a taxa. Similarly, ‘animals’, ‘mammals’, ‘dogs’ are all taxa – but you\nknow that a dog is a mammal and mammals are animals. Therefore,\n‘animals’, ‘mammals’ and ‘dogs’ represent taxa at different levels.\nHence, based on characteristics, all living organisms can be classified\ninto different taxa. This process of classification is taxonomy . External\nand internal structure, along with the structure of cell, development\nprocess and ecological information of organisms are essential and form\nthe basis of modern taxonomic studies.\nHence, characterisation, identification, classification and nomenclature\nare the processes that are basic to taxonomy.\nTaxonomy is not something new. Human beings have always been\ninterested in knowing more and more about the various kinds of\norganisms, particularly with reference to their own use. In early days,\nhuman beings needed to find sources for their basic needs of food, clothing\nand shelter . Hence, the earliest classifications wer e based on the ‘uses’ of\nvarious organisms.\nHuman beings were, since long, not only interested in knowing more\nabout different kinds of organisms and their diversities, but also the\nrelationships among them. This branch of study was referred to as\nsystematics . The word systematics  is derived from the Latin word\n‘systema’ which means systematic arrangement of organisms.  Linnaeus\nReprint 2025-26\n\n6 BIOLOGY\nused Systema Naturae  as the  title of his publication.  The scope of\nsystematics was later enlarged to include identification, nomenclature\nand classification. Systematics takes into account evolutionary\nrelationships between organisms.\n1.2 TAXONOMIC  CATEGORIES\nClassification is not a single step process but involves hierarchy of steps\nin which each step represents a rank or category.  Since the category is a\npart of overall taxonomic arrangement, it is called the taxonomic category\nand all categories together constitute the \ntaxonomic hierarchy .  Each\ncategory, referred to as a unit of classification,  in fact, represents a rank\nand is commonly termed as taxon (pl.: taxa) .\nTaxonomic categories and hierarchy can be illustrated by an example.\nInsects represent a group of organisms sharing common features like\nthree pairs of jointed legs.  It means insects are recognisable concrete\nobjects which can be classified, and thus were given a rank or category.\nCan you name other such groups of or ganisms? Remember , groups\nrepresent category.  Category further denotes rank.  Each rank or taxon ,\nin fact, represents a unit of classification. These taxonomic groups/\ncategories are distinct biological entities and not merely morphological\naggregates.\nTaxonomical studies of all known organisms have led to the\ndevelopment of common categories such as kingdom, phylum or division\n(for plants), class, or der, family, genus and species. All or ganisms,\nincluding those in the plant and animal kingdoms have species as the\nlowest category. Now the question you may ask is, how to place an\norganism in various categories? The basic requirement is the knowledge\nof characters of an individual or group of organisms.  This helps in\nidentifying similarities and dissimilarities among the individuals of the\nsame kind of organisms as well as of other kinds of organisms.\n1.2.1 Species\nTaxonomic studies consider a group of individual organisms with\nfundamental similarities as a species .  One should be able to distinguish\none species from the other closely related species based on the distinct\nmorphological differences. Let us consider Mangifera indica , Solanum\ntuberosum (potato) and Panthera leo  (lion). All the three names, indica,\ntuberosum and leo, represent the specific epithets,  while the first words\nMangifera, Solanum and Panthera are genera and represents another\nhigher level of taxon or category. Each genus may have one or more than\none specific epithets representing different organisms, but having\nmorphological similarities.  For example,  Panthera has another specific\nepithet called tigris  and Solanum  includes species like nigrum  and\nReprint 2025-26\n\nTHE LIVING W ORLD 7\nmelongena . Human beings belong to the species sapiens  which is grouped\nin the genus Homo . The scientific name thus, for human being, is written\nas Homo sapiens .\n1.2.2 Genus\nGenus comprises a group of related species which has more characters\nin common in comparison to species of other genera. W e can say that\ngenera are aggregates of closely related species. For example, potato and\nbrinjal are two different species but both belong to the genus \nSolanum.\nLion (Panthera leo ), leopar d (P. par dus) and tiger (P . tigris ) with several\ncommon features, are all species of the genus Panthera. This genus differs\nfrom another genus Felis which includes cats.\n1.2.3 Family\nThe next category, Family , has a group of related genera with still less\nnumber of similarities as compared to genus and species.   Families are\ncharacterised on the basis of both vegetative and reproductive features of\nplant species. Among plants for example, three different genera Solanum ,\nPetunia and Datura are placed in the family Solanaceae. Among animals\nfor example, genus Panthera , comprising lion, tiger , leopar d is put along\nwith genus, Felis (cats) in the family Felidae. Similarly, if you observe the\nfeatures of a cat and a dog, you will find some similarities and  some\ndifferences as well. They are separated into two different families – Felidae\nand Canidae , respectively .\n1.2.4 Order\nYou have seen earlier that categories like species, genus and families ar e\nbased on a number of similar characters.   Generally, order and other\nhigher taxonomic categories are identified based on the aggregates of\ncharacters.  Order being a higher category, is the assemblage of families\nwhich exhibit a few similar characters.  The similar characters are less in\nnumber as compared to different genera included in a family.  Plant\nfamilies like Convolvulaceae, Solanaceae are included in the order\nPolymoniales mainly based on the floral characters. The animal or der,\nCarnivora, includes families like Felidae and Canidae.\n1.2.5 Class\nThis category includes related orders. For example, order Primata\ncomprising monkey, gorilla and gibbon is placed in class Mammalia along\nwith order Car nivora that includes animals like tiger , cat and dog. Class\nMammalia has other orders also.\n1.2.6 Phylum\nClasses comprising animals like fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds along\nwith mammals constitute the next higher category called Phylum. All\nReprint 2025-26\n\n8 BIOLOGY\nthese, based on the common features like presence of notochord\nand dorsal hollow neural system, are included in phylum\nChordata.  In case of plants,  classes with a few similar characters\nare assigned to a higher category called Division.\n1.2.7 Kingdom\nAll animals belonging to various phyla are assigned to the\nhighest category called Kingdom Animalia in the classification\nsystem of animals. The Kingdom Plantae, on the other hand, is\ndistinct, and comprises all plants from various divisions.\nHenceforth ,\n we will refer to these two groups as animal and\nplant kingdoms.\nThe taxonomic categories from species to kingdom have been\nshown in ascending order starting with species in Figure 1.1.\nThese ar e broad categories.  However , taxonomists have also\ndeveloped sub-categories in this hierarchy to facilitate more\nsound and scientific placement of various taxa.\nLook at the hierarchy in Figure 1.1. Can you recall the basis\nof arrangement? Say, for example, as we go higher from species\nto kingdom, the number of common characteristics goes on\ndecreasing. Lower the taxa, more are the characteristics that the\nmembers within the taxon share. Higher the category, greater is\nthe difficulty of determining the relationship to other taxa at the\nsame level. Hence, the problem of classification becomes more\ncomplex.\nTable 1.1 indicates the taxonomic categories to which some\ncommon organisms like housefly, man, mango and wheat belong.Figure 1.1 Taxonomic\ncategories\nshowing\nhierarchial\narrangement\nin ascending\norder\nCommon Biological Genus Family Order Class Phylum/\nName  Name Division\nMan Homo sapiens Homo Hominidae Primata Mammalia Chordata\nHousefly Musca\nMusca Muscidae Diptera Insecta Arthropoda\ndomestica\nMango Mangifera Mangifera Anacardiaceae Sapindales Dicotyledonae Angiospermae\nindica\nWheat Triticum Triticum Poaceae Poales Monocotyledonae Angiospermae\naestivumTABLE 1.1  Organisms with their Taxonomic Categories\nReprint 2025-26\n\nTHE LIVING WORLD 9\nSUMMARY\nThe living world is rich in variety. Millions of plants and animals have been\nidentified and described but a large number still remains unknown. The\nvery range of organisms in terms of size, colour , habitat, physiological and\nmorphological features make us seek the defining characteristics of living\norganisms. In order to facilitate the study of kinds and diversity of organisms,\nbiologists have evolved certain rules and principles for identification,\nnomenclature and classification of organisms. The branch of knowledge\ndealing with these aspects is referred to as taxonomy. The taxonomic studies\nof various species of plants and animals are useful in agriculture, forestry,\nindustry and in general for knowing our bio-resources and their diversity.\nThe basics of taxonomy like identification, naming and classification of\norganisms are universally evolved under international codes. Based on the\nresemblances and distinct differences, each organism is identified and\nassigned a correct scientific/biological name comprising two words as per\nthe binomial system of nomenclature. An organism represents/occupies a\nplace or position in the system of classification. There are many categories/\nranks which are generally referred to as taxonomic categories or taxa. A ll\nthe categories constitute a taxonomic hierarchy .\nEXERCISES\n1.Why are living organisms classified?\n2.Why are the classification systems changing every now and then?\n3.What different criteria would you choose to classify people that you\nmeet often?\n4.What do we learn from identification of individuals and populations?\n5.Given below is the scientific name of Mango.
