      "content": "Chapter 1 we have seen that in a democracy it is neither possible nor\nnecessary for people to govern directly. The most common form of\ndemocracy in our times is for the people to govern through their\nrepresentatives. In this chapter we will look at how these representatives\nare elected. We begin by understanding why elections are necessary and\nuseful in a democracy. We try to understand how electoral competition\namong parties serves the people. We then go on to ask what makes an\nelection democratic. The basic idea here is to distinguish democratic\nelections from non-democratic elections.\nThe rest of the chapter tries to assess elections in India in the light of\nthis yardstick. We take a look at each stage of elections, from the drawing\nof boundaries of different constituencies to the declaration of results. At\neach stage we ask what should happen and what does happen in elections.\nTowards the end of the chapter, we turn to an assessment of whether\nelections in India are free and fair. Here we also examine the role of the\nElection Commission in ensuring free and fair elections.",

There are more than\none hundred countries in the world\nin which elections take place to\nchoose people’s representatives. We\nalso read that elections are held in\nmany countries that are not\ndemocratic.\nBut why do we need elections?\nLet us try to imagine a democracy\nwithout elections. A rule of the\npeople is possible without any\nelections if all the people can sit\ntogether everyday and take all the\ndecisions. But as we have already\nseen in Chapter 1, this is not\npossible in any large community.\nNor is it possible for everyone to\nhave the time and knowledge to\ntake decisions on all matters.\nTherefore in most democracies\npeople rule through their\nrepresentatives.\nIs there a democratic way of\nselecting representatives without\nelections? Let us think of a place\nwhere representatives are selected\non the basis of age and experience.\nOr a place where they are chosen\non the basis of education or\nknowledge. There could be some\ndifficulty in deciding on who is more\nexperienced or knowledgable. But let\nus say the people can resolve these\ndifficulties. Clearly, such a place\ndoes not require elections.But can we call this place a\ndemocracy? How do we find out if\nthe people like their representatives\nor not? How do we ensure that these\nrepresentatives rule as per the\nwishes of the people? How to make\nsure that those who the people don’t\nlike do not remain their\nrepresentatives? This requires a\nmechanism by which people can\nchoose their representatives at\nregular intervals and change them\nif they wish to do so. This\nmechanism is called election.\nTherefore, elections are considered\nessential in our times for any\nrepresentative democracy.\nIn an election the voters make\nmany choices:\n/UIstopThey can choose who will make\nlaws for them.\n/UIstopThey can choose who will form the\ngovernment and take major\ndecisions.\n/UIstopThey can choose the party whose\npolicies will guide the government\nand law making.\nW WW WWha haha hahat mak t makt mak t makt mak es an ele es an elees an ele es an elees an ele c cc cction tiontion tiontiondemocr democrdemocr democrdemocr a aa aatic? tic?tic? tic?tic?\nElections can be held in many ways.\nAll democratic countries hold\nelections. But most non-democratic\ncountries also hold some kind of\nelections. How do we distinguish\ndemocratic elections from any other\nelection? We have discussed this\nquestion briefly in Chapter 1. We\ndiscussed many examples of\ncountries where elections are held\nbut they can’t really be called\ndemocratic elections. Let us recall\nwhat we learnt there and start with\na simple list of the minimum\nconditions of a democratic election:\n/UIstopFirst, everyone should be able to\nchoose. This means that everyone\nshould have one vote and every\nvote should have equal value.We have seen why\ndemocracies need\nto have elections.\nBut why do rulers\nin non-democratic\ncountries need to\nhold elections?\nReprint 2025-26\n\n37\n/UIstopSecond, there should be\nsomething to choose from. Parties\nand candidates should be free to\ncontest elections and should offer\nsome real choice to the voters.\n/UIstopThird, the choice should be offered\nat regular intervals. Elections must\nbe held regularly after every few\nyears.\n/UIstopFourth, the candidate preferred by\nthe people should get elected.\n/UIstopFifth, elections should be\nconducted in a free and fair\nmanner where people can choose\nas they really wish.\nThese might look like very simple\nand easy conditions. But there are\nmany countries where these are not\nfulfilled. In this chapter we will apply\nthese conditions to the elections held\nin our own country to see if we can\ncall these democratic elections.\nI II IIs it good t s it good ts it good t s it good ts it good t o ha o hao ha o hao ha v vv vve political e politicale political e politicale politicalc cc ccompetition? ompetition?ompetition? ompetition?ompetition?\nElections are thus all about political\ncompetition. This competition takes\nvarious forms. The most obvious form\nis the competition among political\nparties. At the constituency  level, it\ntakes the form of competition among\nseveral candidates. If there is no\ncompetition, elections will become\npointless.\nBut is it good to have political\ncompetition? Clearly, an electoral\ncompetition has many demerits. It\ncreates a sense of disunity and\n‘factionalism’ in every locality. You\nwould have heard of people\ncomplaining of ‘party-politics’ in your\nlocality. Different political parties and\nleaders often level allegations against\none another. Parties and candidates\noften use dirty tricks to win elections.\nSome people say that this pressure\nto win electoral fights does not allow\nsensible long-term policies to be\nformulated. Some good people whomay wish to serve the country do not\nenter this arena. They do not like the\nidea of being dragged into unhealthy\ncompetition.\nOur Constitution makers were\naware of these problems. Yet they\nopted for free competition in\nelections as the way to select our\nfuture leaders. They did so because\nthis system works better in the long\nrun. In an ideal world all political\nleaders know what is good for the\npeople and are motivated only by a\ndesire to serve them. Political\ncompetition is not necessary in such\nan ideal world. But that is not what\nhappens in real life. Political leaders\nall over the world, like all other\nprofessionals, are motivated by a\ndesire to advance their political\ncareers. They want to remain in\npower or get power and positions for\nthemselves.They may wish to serve\nthe people as well, but it is risky to\ndepend entirely on their sense of\nduty. Besides even when they wish\nto serve the people, they may not\nknow what is required to do so, or\ntheir ideas may not match what the\npeople really want.\nHow do we deal with this real life\nsituation? One way is to try and\nimprove the knowledge and character\nof political leaders. The other and\nmore realistic way is to  set up a\nsystem where political leaders are\nrewarded for serving the people and\npunished for not doing so. Who\ndecides this reward or punishment?\nThe simple answer is: the people.\nThis is what electoral competition\ndoes. Regular electoral competition\nprovides incentives to political\nparties and leaders. They know that\nif they raise issues that people want\nto be raised, their popularity and\nchances of victory will increase in\nthe next elections. But if they fail to\nsatisfy the voters with their work\nthey will not be able to win again.Ah! So, elections\nare like exams\nwhere politicians\nand parties know if\nthey have passed\nor failed. But who\nare the examiners?\nELECTORAL POLITICS\nReprint 2025-26\n\n38 DEMOCRA TIC POLITICS\nCan we say that Indian elections are\ndemocratic? To answer this question,\nlet us take a look at how elections are\nheld in India. Lok Sabha and Vidhan\nSabha (Assembly) elections are held\nregularly after every five years. After\nfive years the term of all the elected\nrepresentatives comes to an end. The\nLok Sabha or Vidhan Sabha stands\n‘dissolved’. Elections are held in all\nconstituencies at the same time,\neither on the same day or within a\nfew days. This is called a general\nelection. Sometimes election is held\nonly for one constitutency to fill the\nvacancy caused by death or\nresignation of a member. This iscalled a by-election. In this chapter\nwe will focus on general elections.\nEle EleEle EleElec cc cct tt ttor oror ororal c al cal c al cal c onstituencies onstituenciesonstituencies onstituenciesonstituencies\nYou read about the people of\nHaryana electing 90 MLAs. You may\nhave wondered how they did that.\nDid every person in Haryana vote for\nall the 90 MLAs? You perhaps know\nthat this is not the case. In our\ncountry we follow an area based\nsystem of representation. The\ncountry is divided into different\nareas for purposes of elections.\nThese areas are called electoral\nconstitutencies. The voters who live\nin an area elect one representative.So if a political party is motivated\nonly by desire to be in power, even\nthen it will be forced to serve the\npeople. This is a bit like the way\nmarket works. Even if a shopkeeper\nis interested only in his profit, he is\nforced to give good service to thecustomers. If he does not, the\ncustomer will go to some other shop.\nSimilarly, political competition may\ncause divisions and some ugliness,\nbut it finally helps to force political\nparties and leaders to serve the\npeople.\n3.2 W HAT IS OUR SYSTEM  OF ELECTIONS?Read these two car toons carefully .

One of the\nfeatures of a democratic election is\nthat every vote should have equal\nvalue. That is why our Constitution\nrequires that each constituency\nshould have a roughly equal\npopulation living within it.\nSimilarly, each state is divided into\na specific number of Assembly\nconstituencies. In this case, the\nelected representative is called the\nMember of Legislative Assembly or\nan MLA. Each Parliamentary\nGULBARGA (KALABURAGI) DISTRICT\nIN KARNA TAKAconstituency has within it several\nassembly constituencies. The same\nprinciple applies for Panchayat and\nMunicipal elections. Each village or\ntown is divided into several ‘wards’\nthat are like constituencies. Each\nward elects one member of the\nvillage or the urban local body.\nSometimes these constituencies are\ncounted as ‘seats’, for each\nconstituency represents one seat in\nthe assembly. When we say that ‘Lok\nDal won 60 seats’ in Haryana, it\nmeans that candidates of Lok Dal\nwon in 60 assembly constituencies\nin the state and thus Lok Dal had\n60 MLAs in the state assembly.\nELECTORAL POLITICS/UIstopWhy is the boundary of the Gulbarga Lok Sabha\nconstituency not the same as the district\nboundary of Gulbarga (Kalaburagi)?

Those who are influential and\nresourceful may prevent them from\nwinning elections. If that happens,\nour Parliament and Assemblies\nwould be deprived of the voice of a\nsignificant section of our population.\nThat would make our democracy less\nrepresentative and less democratic.\nSo, the makers of our Constitution\nthought of a special system of\nreserved constituencies for the\nweaker sections. Some constituencies\nare reserved for  people who belong\nto the Scheduled Castes [SC] and\nScheduled Tribes [ST]. In a SC\nreserved constituency only someone\nwho belongs to the Scheduled\nCastes can stand for election.\nSimilarly only those belonging to the\nScheduled Tribes can contest an\nelection from a constituency\nreserved for ST. Currently, in the\nLok Sabha, 84 seats are reserved for\nthe Scheduled Castes and 47 for the\nScheduled Tribes (as on  26 January\n2019). This number is in proportion\nto their share in the total population.\nThus the reserved seats for SC and\nST do not take away the legitimate\nshare of any other social group.\nThis system of reservation\nwas extended later to other\nweaker sections at the district and\nlocal level. In many states, seats\nin rural (panchayat) and urban\n(municipalities and corporations)local bodies are now reserved for\nOther Backward Classes (OBC) as\nwell. However, the proportion of\nseats reserved varies from state to\nstate. Similarly, one-third of the\nseats are reserved in rural and\nurban local bodies for women\ncandidates.\nV VV VVot otot ototers ersers ersers’ ’’ ’’ list  list list  list list\nOnce the constituencies are decided,\nthe next step is to decide who can\nand who cannot vote. This decision\ncannot be left to anyone till the last\nday. In a democratic election, the list\nof those who are eligible to vote\nis prepared much before the\nelection and given to everyone. This\nlist is officially called the Electoral\nRoll and is commonly known as the\nVoters’ List.\nThis is an important step for it is\nlinked to the first condition of a\ndemocratic election: everyone\nshould get an equal opportunity to\nchoose representatives. Earlier, we\nread about the principle of\nuniversal adult franchise. In\npractice it means that everyone\nshould have one vote and each vote\nshould have equal value. No one\nshould be denied the right to vote\nwithout a good reason. Different\ncitizens differ from one another in\nmany ways: some are rich, some are\npoor; some are highly educated,\nsome are not so educated or not\neducated at all; some are kind,\nothers are not so kind.

Even if the ruling party\nor the government does not like what\nthe Commission does, it is virtually\nimpossible for it to remove the CEC.\nVery few election commissions in\nthe world  have such wide-ranging\npowers as the Election Commission\nof India.\n/UIstopEC takes decisions on every aspect\nof conduct and control of elections\nfrom the announcement of\nelections to the declaration of\nresults.\n/UIstopIt implements the Code of\nConduct and punishes any\ncandidate or party that violates it.\n/UIstopDuring the election period, the EC\ncan order the government to follow\nsome guidelines, to prevent use\nand misuse of governmental power\nto enhance its chances to win\nelections, or to transfer some\ngovernment officials.\n/UIstopWhen on election duty, govern-\nment officers work under the con-\ntrol of the EC and not the govern-\nment.\nIn the last 25 years or so, the\nElection Commission has begun to\nexercise all its powers and even\nexpand them. It is very common now\nfor the Election Commission to\nreprimand the government and\nadministration for their lapses. When\nelection officials come to the opinion\nthat polling was not fair in some booths\nor even an entire constituency, they\norder a repoll. The ruling parties often\ndo not like what the EC does. But they\nhave to ob ey. This would not have\nhappened if the EC was not\nindependent and powerful.\nELECTORAL POLITICSWe get to read a lot about unfair\npractices in elections. Newspapers\nand television reports often refer to\nsuch allegations.

But fortunately\nthey are not on such a scale so as to\ndefeat the very purpose of elections.\nThis becomes clear if we ask a basic\nquestion: Can a party win an\nelection and come to power not\nbecause it has popular support but\nthrough electoral malpractices?

Do\nthey actually use these powers?\nThe answer to all these questions\nis quite positive for our country.
