Then\n(i)z1 + z2 = (a + c) + i (b + d)\n(ii) z1 z2  = (ac – bd) + i (ad + bc )\n®For any non-zero complex number z = a + ib (a ≠ 0, b ≠ 0), there exists the\ncomplex number 2 2 2 2a bi\na b a b−+\n+ +, denoted by 1\nz or z–1, called the\nmultiplicative inverse  of z such that ( a + ib) 2 2 2 2−   +     + +a bi\na b a b= 1 + i0\n=1\n®For any integer k, i4k = 1, i4k + 1 = i, i4k + 2 = – 1, i4k + 3 = – i\n®The conjugate of the complex number z = a + ib, denoted by z, is given by\nz = a – ib.\nHistorical Note\nThe fact that square root of a negative number does not exist in the real number\nsystem was recognised by the Greeks. But the credit goes to the Indian\nmathematician Mahavira\n (850) who first stated this dif ficulty clearly . “He\nmentions in his work ‘ Ganitasara Sangraha ’ as in the nature of things a negative\n(quantity) is not a square (quantity)’,  it has, therefore, no square root”.\nBhaskara , another Indian mathematician, also writes in his work Bijaganita ,\nwritten in 1 150. “There is no square root of a negative quantity , for it is not a\nsquare.” Cardan (1545) considered the problem of solving\nx + y = 10, xy  = 40.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n88       MA THEMA TICS\n—vvvvv—He obtained x = 5 + 15− and y = 5 – 15− as the solution of it, which\nwas discarded by him by saying that these numbers are ‘useless’.  Albert\nGirar d (about 1625) accepted square root of negative numbers and said that\nthis will enable us to get as many roots as the degree of the polynomial equation.\nEuler  was the first to introduce the symbol i for 1− and W.R. Hamilton\n(about 1830) regarded the complex number a + ib as an ordered pair of real\nnumbers ( a, b) thus giving it a purely mathematical definition and avoiding use\nof the so called ‘ imaginary numbers ’.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n",
