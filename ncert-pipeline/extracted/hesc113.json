Are they approximately equal?\nIf the experiment is carried out carefully,\nit is seen that the angle of incidence is\nalways equal to the angle of reflection .\nThis is one of the laws of reflection .\nLet us per form another activity on\nreflection.\nWhat would happen if I\nthrew the light on the\nmirror along the normal.\nActivity 13.2\nPerfor m Activity 13.1 again. This\ntime use a sheet of stiff paper or a\nchart paper . Let the sheet pr oject a\nlittle beyond the edge of the Table\n(Fig. 13.4). Cut the projecting\nportion of the sheet in the middle.\nLook at the reflected ray. Make sure\nthat the reflected ray extends to the\nprojected portion of the paper . Bend\nthat part of the projected portion on\nwhich the reflected ray falls. Can\nyou still see the reflected ray? Bring\nthe paper back to the original\nFig. 13.2 : Drawing the normal\nFig. 13.3 : Angle of incidence and angle of\nreflectionReflected\nray\nNormalIncident\nraybetween the normal and incident ray is\ncalled the angle of incidence ( ∠ ∠∠ ∠∠i). The\nangle between the normal and the\nreflected ray is known as the \nangle of\nreflection  (∠ ∠∠ ∠∠r) (Fig. 13.3). Measure the\nangle of incidence and the angle of\nreflection. Repeat the activity several\ntimes by changing the  angle of\nincidence. Enter the data  in Table 13.1.\n2024-25\n\nLIGHT 167position. Can you see the reflected\nray again? What do you infer?with the S un as the source of light\ninstead of a torch. You, too, can use the\nSun as the source of light.\nThese activities can also be performed\nby making use of the Ray Streak\nApparatus (available in the kit\nprepared by NCER T).\nBoojho remembered that in Class VII,\nhe had studied some features of the\nimage of an object formed by a plane\nmirror . Paheli asked him to r ecall\nthose features:\n(i)Was the image er ect or upside\ndown?\n(ii)Was it of the same size as the\nobject?\n(iii)Did the image appear at  the same\ndistance behind the mirror as the\nobject was in front of it?\n(iv)Could it be obtained on a screen?\nLet us understand a little more about\nthe formation of an image by a plane\nmirror in the following way:\nActivity 13.3\nA source of light O is placed in front\nof a plane mirror PQ. Two rays OA\nand OC are incident on it (Fig. 13.5).\nCan you find out the direction of\nthe reflected rays?\nDraw nor mals to the sur face of\nthe mirror PQ, at the points A and\nC. Then draw the reflected rays at\nthe points A and C. How would you\ndraw these rays? Call the reflected\nrays AB and CD, respectively.\nExtend them further . Do they meet?\nExtend them backwards. Do they\nmeet now? If they meet, mark this\npoint as I. For a viewer’s eye at E\n(Fig. 13 .5), do the reflected rays(b)\nFig. 13.4 (a), (b) : Incident ray, reflected ray\nand the normal at the point\nof incidence lie in the same\nplane\nWhen the whole sheet of paper is\nspread on the table, it represents one\nplane. The incident ray, the normal at\nthe point of incidence and the reflected\nray are all in this plane. When you bend\nthe paper you create a plane different\nfrom the plane in which the incident\nray and the normal lie. Then you do not\nsee the reflected ray. What does it\nindicate? It indicates that the incident\nray, the normal at the point of\nincidence and the reflected ray all lie\nin the same plane. This is another law\nof reflection.\nPaheli and Booj ho per formed the\nabove activities outside the classroom\n(a)\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 168appear to come from the point I.\nSince the reflected rays do not\nactually meet at I, but only appear\nto do so, we say that a virtual image\nof the point O is formed at I. As you\nhave learnt already in Class VII,\nsuch an image cannot be obtained\non a screen.\nYou may recall that in an image\nformed by a  mirror the left of the object\nappears on the right and the right\nappears on the left. This is known as\nlateral inversion .\n13.3 Regular and Diffused\nReflection\nActivity 13.4\nImagine that parallel rays are\nincident on an irr egular sur face as\nshown in Fig. 13.6. Remember that\nthe laws of reflection are valid at\neach point of the sur face. Use these\nlaws to construct reflected rays at\nvarious points. Are they parallel to\none another? Y ou will find that\nthese rays are reflected in different\ndirections. (Fig. 13.7)When all the parallel rays reflected\nfrom a r ough or irr egular sur face ar e\nnot parallel, the reflection is known as\ndiffused  or irregular  reflection.\nRemember that the diffused reflection\nis not due to the failure of the laws of\nreflection. It is caused by the\nirregularities in the reflecting sur face,\nlike that of a cardboard.\nOn the other hand , reflection from\na smooth sur face like that of a\nmirror is called regular reflection\n(Fig. 1 3.8). Images are formed by\nregular reflection.Fig. 13.5 : Image formation in a plane mirrorFig. 13.6 : Parallel rays incident on\nan irregular surface\nFig. 13.7 : Rays reflected from irregular\nsurface\nFig. 13.8 : Regular reflection\n2024-25\n\nLIGHT 169Let us find out.\n13.4 Reflected Light Can be\nReflected Again\nRecall the last time you visited a hair\ndresser . She/he makes you sit in front of\na mirr or. After your hair cut is complete,\nshe/he holds  a mirror behind you  to show\nyou how the hair has been cut\n(Fig. 1 3.9). \nDo you know how you could\nsee the hair at the back of your head?Paheli recalls having constructed a\nperiscope as an Extended Activity in\nClass VI. The periscope makes use of\ntwo plane mirrors. Can you explain\nhow reflection from the two mirrors\nenables you to see objects which are\nnot visible directly? Periscopes are\nused in submarines, tanks and also\nby soldiers in bunkers to see things\noutside.\n13.5 Multiple Images\nYou ar e awar e that a plane mirr or for ms\nonly a single image of an object. What\nhappens if two plane mirrors are used\nin combination? Let us see.Do W e See all Objects due to Reflected Light?\nNearly everything you see around is seen due to reflected light. Moon, for example,\nreceives light from the Sun and reflects it. That’s how we see the moon. The objects\nwhich shine in the light of other objects are called illuminated  objects . Can you\nname some other such objects?\nThere are other objects, which give their own light, such as the Sun, fire, flame\nof a candle and an electric lamp. Their  light falls on our eyes. That is how we see\nthem. The objects which emit their own light are known as luminous objects.\nFig. 13.9 : Mirror at the hair dresser shop\nI have a question. Can the\nreflected rays be further reflected\nif incident on another mirror?\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 170Activity 13.5\nTake two plane mirrors. Set them\nat right angles to each other with\ntheir edges touching (Fig. 13.10). To\nhinge them you can use adhesive\ntape. Place a coin in between the\nmirrors. How many images of the\ncoin do you see (Fig. 13.10)?\nNow hinge the mirrors using the\nadhesive tape at different angles, say\n45°, 60°, 120°, 180° etc. Place some\nobject (say a candle) in between\nthem. Note down the number of\nimages of the object in each case.\nFinally, set the two mirrors\nparallel to each other . Find out\nhow many images of a candle\nplaced between them are formed\n(Fig. 13.11).Fig. 13.10 : Images in plane mirror at right\nangle to each other\nFig. 13.11 : Image in plane mirror parallel\nto each other\nmirrors\n(a)\n(b) (c)Can you now explain how you can\nsee the back of your head at the hair\ndresser’s shop?\nThis idea of number of images formed\nby mirrors placed at an angle to one\nanother is used in a kaleidoscope to\nmake numer ous beautiful patter ns. You\ncan also make a kaleidoscope yourself.\nKaleidoscope\nActivity 13.6\nTo make a kaleidoscope, get three\nrectangular mirror strips each about\n15 cm long and 4 cm wide. Join\nthem together to form a prism as\nshown in Fig. 13.12(a). Fix this\narrangement of mirrors in a circular\ncardboard tube or tube of a thick\nchart paper . Make sur e that the tube\nis slightly longer than the mirror\nstrips. Close one end of the tube by\na cardboard disc having a hole in\nthe centre, through which you can\nsee [Fig. 13.12(b)]. To make the disc\ndurable, paste a piece of transparent\nplastic sheet under the cardboard\nFig. 13.12 : Making a kaleidoscope\n2024-25\n\nLIGHT 171disc. At the other end, touching the\nmirrors, fix a circular plane glass\nplate [Fig. 13.12(c)]. Place on this\nglass plate several small pieces of\ncoloured glass (broken pieces of\ncoloured bangles). Close this end of\nthe tube by a ground glass plate.\nAllow enough space for the colour\npieces to move around.\nYour kaleidoscope is r eady. When\nyou peep through the hole, you will be\nable to see a variety of patterns in the\ntube. An interesting feature of a\nkaleidoscope is that you will never see\nthe same pattern again. Designers of\nwallpapers and fabrics and artists often\nuse kaleidoscopes to get ideas for new\npatterns. To make your toy attractive,\nyou can wrap the kaleidoscope in a\ncolour ed paper .13.6 Sunlight — White or\nColoured\nIn Class VII, you learnt that the sunlight\nis referred to as white light. Y ou also\nlearnt that it consists of seven colours.\nHere is another activity (Activity 13.7)\nshowing that sunlight consists of several\ncolours.\n13.7 What is inside Our Eyes?\nWe see things only when light coming\nfrom them enters our eyes. Eye is one\nof our most important sense organs. It\nis, therefore, important to understand\nits structure and working.\nThe eye has a roughly spherical\nshape. The outer coat of the eye is\nwhite. It is tough so that it can protect\nthe interior of the eye from accidents.\nIts transparent front part is called\nActivity 13.7\nFig. 13.13 : Dispersion of lightGet a plane mirror of a suitable size.\nPlace it in a bowl ( katori) as shown\nin Fig. 1 3.13. Fill the bowl with\nwater . Put this arrangement near a\nwindow in such a way that direct\nsunlight falls on the mirr or. Adjust\nthe position of the\nbowl so that the\nreflected light from\nthe mirror falls on\na wall. If the wall is\nnot white, fix a sheet\nof white paper on it.\nReflected light will\nbe seen to have\nmany colours. How\ncan you explain\nthis? The mirror\nand water form aprism. As you learnt in Class VII ,\nthis breaks up the light into its\ncolours,  Splitting of light into its\ncolours is known as dispersion  of\nlight.  Rainbow is a natural\nphenomenon showing dispersion.\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 172Fig. 13.15 : Demonstration of blind spotCaution : For this activity, never use\na laser torch.\nActivity 13.8\nLook into your friend’s eye. Observe\nthe size of the pupil. Throw light on\nher eye with a torch. Observe the\npupil now. Switch off the torch, and\nobserve her pupil once again. Do\nyou notice any change in the size\nof the pupil? In which case was the\npupil larger? Why do you think it\nwas so?\nIn which case do you need to\nallow more light in the eye, when\nthe light is dim or bright?\nBehind the pupil of the eye is a lens\nwhich is thicker in the centre. What\nkind of lens is thicker at the centre?\nRecall what you learnt about lenses incornea  (Fig. 13.14).  Behind the cornea,\nwe find a dark muscular structure\ncalled iris. In the iris, there is a small\nopening called the pupil. The size of\nthe pupil is controlled by the iris. The\niris is that part of eye which gives it its\ndistinctive colour . When we say that a\nperson has green eyes, we refer actually\nto the colour of the iris. The iris controls\nthe amount of light entering into the\neye. Let us see how.\nIris\nLens\nCiliary\nmuscle\nCornea\nRetinaOptic\nNerve\nFig. 13.14 : Human eyeClass VII. The lens focuses light on the\nback of the eye, on a layer  called retina\n(Fig. 13.14). The retina contains several\nnerve cells. Sensations felt by the nerve\ncells are then transmitted to the brain\nthrough the optic nerve. There are two\nkinds of cells–\n(i)cones, which are sensitive to bright\nlight and\n(ii)rods, which are sensitive to dim light.\nCones sense colour . At the junction\nof the optic nerve and the retina, there\nare no sensory cells, so no vision is\npossible at that spot. This is called the\nblind spot . Its existence can be\ndemonstrated as follows:\nActivity 13.9\nMake a round mark and a cross on\na sheet of paper with the spot to the\nright of the cross (Fig. 13.15). The\ndistance between two marks may be\n6-8 cm. Hold the sheet of paper at\nan arm’s length from the eye. Close\nyour left eye. Look continuously at\nthe cross. Move the sheet slowly\ntowards you, keeping your eye on\nthe cross. What do you find? Does\nthe round mark disappear at some\npoint? Now close your right eye.\nLook at the round mark now and\nrepeat the activity. Does the cross\ndisappear? The disappearance of the\ncross or the round mark shows that\nthere is a point on the retina which\ncannot send messages to the brain\nwhen light falls on it.\n2024-25\n\nLIGHT 173Nature has provided eyes with\neyelids to prevent any object from\nentering the eye. Eyelids also shut out\nlight when not required.\nEye is such a wonder ful instrument\nthat it (normal) can clearly\n see distant\nobjects as well as objects nearby . The\nminimum distance at which the eye can\nsee objects distinctly varies with age. The\nmost comfortable distance at which one\ncan read with a normal eye is about\n25 cm.\nSome persons can see objects close\nto them clearly but cannot see distant\nobjects so clearly. On the other hand,\nsome persons cannot see objects nearby\nclearly but they can see distant objects\nquite well. With suitable corrective\nlenses, these defects of the eye can\nbe corrected.\nSometimes, particularly in old age,\neyesight becomes foggy. It is due to the\neye lens becoming cloudy. When it\nhappens, persons are said to have\ncataract. There is a loss of vision,\nsometimes extremely severe. It is\npossible to treat this defect. The opaque\nlens is removed and a new artificial\nlens is inserted. Modern technology\nhas made this procedure simpler\nand safer .\n13.8 Care of the Eyes\nIt is necessary that you take proper care\nof your eyes. If there is any problem\nyou should go to an eye specialist. Have\na regular checkup—\nlIf advised, use suitable spectacles.\nlToo little or too much light is bad\nfor eyes. Insufficient light causes\neyestrain and headaches. Too much\nlight, like that of the Sun, a power fulThe movies that we see are actually\na number of separate pictures in\nproper sequence. They are made to\nmove across the eye usually at the rate\nof 24 pictures  per second (faster\nthan 16 per second). So, we see a\nmoving picture.\nFront side of\ncardboardReverse side\nof cardboardThe impression of an image does not\nvanish immediately from the retina. It\npersists there for about 1/16th of a\nsecond. So, if still images of a moving\nobject are flashed on the eye at a rate\nfaster than 16 per second, then the eye\nperceives this object as moving.\nActivity 13.10\nGet a square piece of cardboard of\nsize 6-8 cm. Make two holes as\nshown in Fig. 13.16. Thread a\nstring through the two holes. Draw/\npaste a cage on one side of the\ncardboard and a bird on the other\nside. Twist the string and make the\ncard twirl rapidly. Do you see the\nbird in the cage?\nFig. 13.16 : Bird in cage\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 174lamp or a laser torch can injure the\nretina.\nlDo not look at the Sun or a power ful\nlight directly.\nlNever rub your eyes. If particles of\ndust go into your eyes, wash your\neyes with clean water . If there is no\nimprovement go to a doctor .\nlAlways read at the normal distance\nfor vision. Do not read by bringing\nthe book too close to your eyes or\nkeeping it too far .\nYou lear nt about balanced diet in\nClass VI. If food is deficient in some\ncomponents, eyes may also suf fer. Lack\nof vitamin A in foodstuff is responsible\nfor many eye troubles.  Most common\namongst them is night blindness.\nOne should, therefore, include in the\ndiet components which have vitamin A.\nRaw carrots, broccoli and greenDid you know?\nAnimals have eyes shaped in different ways. Eyes of a crab are quite small but\nthey enable the crab to look all around. So, the crab can sense even if the enemy\napproaches from behind. Butterflies have large eyes that seem to be made up\nof thousands of little eyes\n(Fig. 13.17). They can see not only\nin the front and the sides but the\nback as well.\nA night bird (owl) can see very\nwell in the night but not during\nthe day. On the other hand, day\nlight birds (kite, eagle) can see\nwell during the day but not in the\nnight. The owl has a large cornea\nand a large pupil to allow more\nlight in its eye. Also, it has on its\nretina a large number of rods and\nonly a few cones. The day birds\non the other hand, have more\ncones and fewer rods.Fig. 13.17 : Eyes of a butterfly\nEyes\nvegetables (such as spinach) and cod\nliver oil are rich in vitamin A. Eggs,\nmilk, curd, cheese, butter and fruits\nsuch as papaya and mango are also rich\nin vitamin A.\n13.9 Visually Impaired\nPersons Can Read and\nWrite\nSome persons, including children, can\nbe visually impaired. They have very\nlimited vision to see things. Some\npersons cannot see at all since birth.\nSome persons may lose their eyesight\nbecause of a disease or an injury. Such\npersons try to identify things by\ntouching and listening to voices more\ncarefully. They develop their other\nsenses mor e sharply. However ,\nadditional resources can enable them\nto develop their capabilities further .\n2024-25\n\nLIGHT 17513.10 What is the Braille\nSystem?\nThe most popular resource for visually\nchallenged persons is Braille .\nLouis Braille\nLouis Braille, himself a visually\nchallenged person, developed a\nsystem for visually challenged persons\nand published it in 1821.Non-optical and optical aids for visually impaired\nNon-optical aids include visual aids, tactual aids (using the sense of touch), auditory\naids (using the sense of hearing) and electronic aids. Visual aids, can magnify\nwords, can provide suitable intensity of light and material at proper distances.\nTactual aids, including Braille writer slate and stylus, help the visually challenged\npersons in taking notes, reading and writing. Auditory aids include cassettes, tape\nrecorders, talking books and other such devices. Electronic aids, such as talking\ncalculators  and computers , are also available for performing many computational\ntasks. Closed circuit television, also an electronic aid, enlarges printed material\nwith suitable contrast and illumination. Nowadays, use of audio CDs and voice boxes\nwith computers are also very helpful for listening to and writing the desired text.\nOptical aids include bifocal lenses, contact lenses, tinted lenses, magnifiers\nand telescopic aids. While the lens combinations are used to rectify visual\nlimitations, telescopic aids are available to view chalkboard and class\ndemonstrations.\nThe present system was adopted in\n1932. There is Braille code for common\nlanguages, mathematics and scientific\nnotation. Many Indian languages can\nbe read using the Braille system.Braille system has 63 dot patterns or\ncharacters. Each character\nrepresents a letter , a combination of\nletters, a common word or a\ngrammatical sign. Dots are arranged\nin cells of two vertical rows of three\ndots each.\nPatterns of dots to represent some\nEnglish letters and some common\nwords are shown below.\nThese patterns when embossed on\nBraille sheets help visually\nchallenged persons to recognise words\nby touching. To make them easier to\ntouch, the dots are raised slightly.Fig. 13.18 : Example of dot patterns used\nin Braille System\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 176\nSome visually impaired Indians have great achievements to their\ncredit. Diwakar , a child pr odigy has given amazing per formances\nas a singer .\nRavindra Jain, born completely visually impaired, obtained\nhis Sangeet Prabhakar degree from Allahabad. He had shown his\nexcellence as a lyricist, singer and music composer .\nLal Advani, himself visually impaired, established an\nAssociation for special education and rehabilitation of disabled\nin India. Besides this, he represented India on Braille problems\nin UNESCO.\nHelen A. Keller , an American author and lectur er, is per haps the most well-\nknown and inspiring visually challenged person. She lost her sight when she was\nonly 18 months old. But because of her resolve and courage she could complete\nher graduation from a university. She wrote a number of books including The\nStory of my Life  (1903).Helen A. KellerVisually impaired people learn the\nBraille system by beginning with\nletters,  then special characters and\nletter combinations. Methods depend\nupon recognition by touching. Eachcharacter has to be memorised. Braille\ntexts can be produced by hand or by\nmachine. T ypewriter -like devices and\nprinting machines have now been\ndeveloped.\n2024-25\n\nLIGHT 177\n     KEYWORDSKEYWORDSKEYWORDSKEYWORDSKEYWORDS\nANGLE OF\nINCIDENCE\nANGLE OF\nREFLECTION\nBLIND SPOT\nBRAILLE\nCONES\nCORNEA\nDIFFUSED OR\nIRREGULAR\nREFLECTION\nINCIDENT RA YS\nIRIS\nKALEIDOSCOPE\nLATERAL INVERSION\nLAWS OF\nREFLECTION\nPUPIL\nREFLECTED RA YS\nREFLECTION\nREGULAR\nREFLECTION\nRETINA\nRODS WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT\nÜLight is reflected from all surfaces.\nÜRegular reflection takes place when light is\nincident on smooth, polished and regular\nsurfaces.\nÜDiffused or irregular reflection takes place from\nrough surfaces.\nÜTwo laws of reflection are\n(i)The angle of incidence is equal to the angle\nof reflection.\n(ii)Incident ray, reflected ray and the normal\ndrawn at the point of incidence to the\nreflecting surface, lie in the same plane.\nÜImage formed in a plane mirror undergoes\nlateral inversion.\nÜTwo mirrors inclined to each other give multiple\nimages.\nÜBeautiful patterns are formed in a\nkaleidoscope because of multiple reflections.\nÜSunlight, called white light, consists of seven\ncolours.\nÜSplitting of light into its constituent colours is\nknown as dispersion.\nÜParts of the eye are cornea, iris, pupil, lens,\nretina and optic nerve.\nÜA normal eye can see nearby and distant\nobjects clearly.\nÜVisually impaired persons can read and write\nusing the Braille system.\nÜVisually impaired persons develop their other\nsenses more sharply to improve their interac-\ntion with their environment.\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 178Exercises\n1.Suppose you are in a dark room.
