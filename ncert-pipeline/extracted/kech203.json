Why?\n9.2.3  Properties\nPhysical properties\nAlkanes ar\ne almost non-polar molecules \nbecause of the covalent nature of C-C and \nC-H bonds and due to very little difference of electronegativity between carbon and hydrogen atoms. They possess weak van der Waals forces. Due to the weak forces, the first four members, C\n1 to C4 are gases, C5 to C17 \nare liquids and those containing 18 carbon atoms or more are solids at 298 K. They are colourless and odourless. What do you think about solubility of alkanes in water based upon non-polar nature of alkanes? Petrol is a mixture of hydrocarbons and is used as a fuel for automobiles. Petrol and lower fractions of petroleum are also used for  dry cleaning of clothes to remove grease stains. On the basis of this observation, what do you think about the nature of the greasy substance? You are correct if you say that \ngrease (mixture of higher alkanes) is non-\nUnit 9.indd   301 03-05-2024   17:16:25\nReprint 2025-26\n\n302\nchemistry\npolar and, hence, hydrophobic  in nature. It is \ngenerally observed that in relation to solubility of substances in solvents, polar substances are soluble in polar solvents, whereas the non-polar ones in non-polar solvents i.e., like \ndissolves like.\n Boiling point (b.p.) of different alkanes are\n \ngiven in Table 9.2 from which it is clear that there is a steady increase in boiling point with increase in molecular mass. This is due to the fact that the intermolecular van der Waals forces increase with increase of the molecular size or the surface area of the molecule. \n You can make an interesting \nobservation \nby having a look on the boiling points of  \nthree isomeric pentanes viz., (pentane,  \n2-methylbutane and 2,2-dimethylpropane). It is observed (Table 9.2) that pentane having a continuous chain of five carbon atoms has the highest boiling point (309.1K) whereas  \n2,2 – dimethylpropane boils at 282.5K. With increase in number of branched chains, the molecule attains the shape of a sphere. This results in smaller area of contact and therefore weak intermolecular forces between spherical molecules, which are overcome at relatively lower temperatures. \nChemical properties\nAs already mentioned, alkanes are generally inert towards acids, bases, oxidising and reducing agents. However, they undergo the following reactions under certain  \nconditions.\n1. Substitution reactions\nOne or more hydrogen atoms of alkanes \ncan be replaced by halogens, nitro group and sulphonic acid group. Halogenation  \ntakes place either at higher temperature  \n(573-773 K) or in the presence of diffused sunlight or ultraviolet light. Lower alkanes do not undergo nitration and sulphonation reactions. These reactions in which hydrogen atoms of alkanes are substituted are known as substitution reactions. As an example, \nchlorination of methane is given below:\nHalogenation\nCH\n2 + C1 hv     CH3C1 + HC1\n Chloromethane  (9.\n10)\nCH3C1  +  hv CH2 C12 + HC1\n Dichloromethane  (9. 11)\nCH2C12  hv  CHC13 + HC1\n Trichloromethane  (9.\n12)\nCHC13  +  C12  hv  CC14 + HC1\n Tetrachloromethane  (9.\n13)\nTable 9.2 Variation of Melting Point and Boiling Point in Alkanes\nMolecular  Name  Molecular  b.p./(K)  m.p./(K)\nformula   mass/u   \nCH4 Methane  16 111.0  90.5\nC2H6 Ethane  30 184.4  101.0\nC3H8 Propane  44 230.9  85.3\nC4H10 Butane  58 272.4  134.6\nC4H10 2-Methylpropane  58 261.0  114.7\nC5H12 Pentane  72 309.1  143.3\nC5H12 2-Methylbutane  72 300.9  113.1\nC5H12 2,2-Dimethylpropane  72 282.5  256.4\nC6H14 Hexane  86 341.9  178.5\nC7H16 Heptane  100 371.4  182.4\nC8H18 Octane  114 398.7  216.2\nC9H20 Nonane  128 423.8  222.0\nC10H22 Decane  142 447.1  243.3\nC20H42 Eicosane  282 615.0  309.7\nReprint 2025-26\n\n303\nHydrocarbons\nCH3–CH3  +  C12  hv  CH3–CH2C1   +   HC1\n Chloroethane  (9\n.14)\n It is found that the rate of reaction of\n \nalkanes with halogens is F2 > Cl2 > Br2 > I2. \nRate of replacement of hydrogens of alkanes is :  \n3° > 2° > 1°. Fluorination is too violent to \nbe controlled. Iodination is very slow and a reversible reaction. It can be carried out in the presence of oxidizing agents like HIO\n3 or HNO3.\nCH4+I2  CH3I+HI (9.15)\nHIO3+5HI→312+3H2O (9.16)\n Halogenation is supposed to proceed via \nfree radical \nchain mechanism involving three \nsteps namely initiation, propagation and \ntermination as given below:\nMechanism \n(i) Initiat\nion : The reaction is initiated \nby homolysis of chlorine molecule in the \npresence of light or heat. The Cl–Cl bond is weaker than the C–C and C–H bond and hence, is easiest to break.\nC1–C1\n   hv\nhomolysis C.\n   H3 + C1\n   Chlorine free radicals\n(ii) Propagation :  Chlorine fr\nee radical \nattacks the methane molecule and takes the \nreaction in the forward direction by breaking the C-H bond to generate methyl free radical with the formation of H-Cl.\n(a) CH\n4 +  C+ 1  hv C+  H3 + H–C1\n The methyl radical \nthus obtained attacks \nthe second molecule of chlorine to form  \nCH3 – Cl with the liberation of another chlorine \nfree radical by homolysis of chlorine molecule.(b) CH\n3 +  C1–C1 hv CH3 – C1 + C1\n The chlorine and methyl free radicals\n \ngenerated above repeat steps (a) and (b) \nrespectively and thereby setup a chain of reactions. The propagation steps (a) and (b) are those which directly give principal products, but many other propagation steps are possible and may occur. Two such \nsteps given below explain how more highly haloginated products are formed.\nCH\n3C1 + C.   1 → C.   H2C1 + HC1\nC.   H2C1 + C1– C1 → CH2C12  + C.   1\n(iii)  Termination:\n The reaction stops after \nsome time due to consumption of reactants  \nand / or due to the following side reactions :\n The possible chain terminating steps are:\n(a) C.   1 + C.   1 → C1–C1\n(b) H3 C.    + C.    H3 → H3C– CH3\n(c) H3 C.   1  +  C.   1  →  H3C–C1\n Though in (c), CH3 – Cl,  the one of the \nproducts is formed but free radicals are \nconsumed and the chain is terminated. The above mechanism helps us to understand the reason for the formation of ethane as a byproduct during chlorination of methane. \n2.

Pyrolysis \nHigher alkanes on heating to higher temperature decompose into lower alkanes, alkenes etc. Such a decomposition r\neaction \ninto smaller fragments by the application of heat is called pyrolysis or cracking.\n(9.28)\n Pyrolysis of alkanes is believed to be a \nfree radical reaction. Pr\neparation of oil gas \nor petrol gas from kerosene oil or petrol involves the principle of pyrolysis.

Electron distribution of the sigma \nmolecular orbital is symmetrical around the internuclear axis of the C–C bond which is not disturbed due to rotation about its axis. This permits free rotation about C–C single bond. This rotation results into different spatial arrangements of atoms in space which can change into one another. Such spatial arrangements of atoms which can be converted into one another by rotation around a C-C single bond are called conformations or conformers or rotamers. \nAlkanes can thus have infinite number of conformations by rotation around C-C single bonds. However, it may be remembered that rotation around a C-C single bond is not completely free. It is hindered by a small energy barrier of 1-20 kJ mol\n–1 due to weak \nrepulsive interaction between the adjacent bonds. Such a type of repulsive interaction is called torsional strain.\n Conformations of ethane : E\nthane \nmolecule (C2H6) contains a carbon – carbon \nsingle bond with each carbon atom attached to three hydrogen atoms.  Considering the ball and stick model of ethane, keep one carbon atom stationary and rotate the other carbon atom around the C-C axis. This rotation results into infinite number of spatial arrangements of hydrogen atoms attached to one carbon atom with respect to the hydrogen atoms attached to the other carbon atom. These are called conformational isomers \n(conformers). Thus there are infinite number of conformations of ethane. However, there are two extreme cases. One such conformation in which hydrogen atoms attached to two carbons are as closed together as possible is called eclipsed conformation and the other in \nwhich hydrogens are as far apart as possible is known as the staggered conformation. Any \nother intermediate conformation is called a skew conformation.It may be remembered \nthat in all the conformations, the bond angles and the bond lengths remain the same. Eclipsed and the staggered conformations can \nbe represented by \nsawhorse and newman \npr\nojections.1. Sawhorse projections In this projection, the molecule is viewed along the molecular axis. It is then projected on paper by drawing the central C–C bond as a somewhat longer straight line. Upper end of the line is  slightly tilted towards right or left hand side. The front carbon is shown at the lower end of the line, whereas the rear carbon is shown at the upper end. Each carbon has three lines attached to it corresponding to three hydrogen atoms. The lines are inclined at an angle of 120° to each other. Sawhorse projections of eclipsed and staggered conformations of ethane are depicted in Fig. 9.2.\n2. Newman projections \nIn this projection, the molecule is viewed at the C–C bond head on. The carbon atom nearer to the eye is represented by a point. Three hydrogen atoms attached to the front carbon atom are shown by three lines drawn at an angle of 120° to each other. The rear carbon atom (the carbon atom away from the eye) is represented by a circle and the three hydrogen atoms are shown attached to it by the shorter lines drawn at an angle of 120° to each other. The Newman’s projections are depicted in  \nFig. 9.3.\nFig. 9.2  Sawhorse projections of ethane\nFig. 9.3  Newman’s projections of ethane\nUnit 9.indd   305 10/10/2022   10:37:54 AM\nReprint 2025-26\n\n306\nchemistry\nFig. 9.4  Orbital picture of ethene depicting  \nσ bonds onlyRelative stability of conformations: As \nmentioned earlier, in staggered form of ethane, \nthe electron clouds of carbon-hydrogen bonds are as far apart as possible. Thus, there are minimum repulsive forces, minimum energy and maximum stability of the molecule. On the other hand, when the staggered form changes into the eclipsed form, the electron clouds of the carbon – hydrogen bonds come closer to each other resulting in increase in electron cloud repulsions. To check the increased repulsive forces, molecule will have to possess more energy and thus has lesser stability. As already mentioned, the repulsive interaction between the electron clouds, which affects stability of a conformation, is called torsional strain.  Magnitude of torsional strain depends upon the angle of rotation about C–C bond. This angle is also called dihedral angle or torsional \nangle. Of all the conformations of ethane, the staggered form has the least torsional strain and the eclipsed form, the maximum torsional strain. Therefore, staggered conformation is more stable than the eclipsed conformation. Hence, molecule largely remains in staggered conformation or we can say that it is preferred conformation. Thus it may be inferred that rotation around C–C bond in ethane is not completely free.  The energy difference between the two extreme forms is of the order of 12.5 kJ mol\n–1, which is very small. Even at ordinary \ntemperatures, the ethane molecule gains thermal or kinetic energy sufficient enough to overcome this energy barrier of 12.5 kJ mol\n–1 \nthrough intermolecular collisions. Thus, it can be said that rotation about carbon-carbon single bond in ethane is almost free for all practical purposes. It has not been possible to separate and isolate different conformational isomers of ethane.\n9.3\n Alkenes\nAlkenes are unsaturated hydrocarbons\n \ncontaining at least one double bond. What \nshould be the general formula of alkenes? If there is one double bond between two carbon atoms in alkenes, they must possess two hydrogen atoms less than alkanes. Hence, general formula for alkenes is C\nnH2n. Alkenes \nare also known as olefins (oil forming) since the first member, ethylene or ethene (C2H4) \nwas found to form an oily liquid on reaction with chlorine.\n9.3.1\n structure of Double Bond\nCarbon-carbon double bond in alkenes \nconsists of one str\nong sigma (σ) bond (bond \nenthalpy about 397 kJ mol–1) due to head-on \noverlapping of sp2 hybridised orbitals and \none weak pi (π) bond (bond enthalpy about 284 kJ mol\n–1) obtained by lateral or sideways \noverlapping of the two 2p orbitals of the two carbon atoms. The double bond is shorter in bond length (134 pm) than the C–C single bond (154 pm). You have already read that the pi (π) bond is a weaker bond due to poor sideways overlapping between the two 2p orbitals. Thus, the presence of the pi (π) bond makes alkenes behave as sources of loosely held mobile electrons. Therefore, alkenes are easily attacked by reagents or compounds which are in search of electrons. Such reagents are called electrophilic reagents. The presence of weaker π -bond makes alkenes \nunstable molecules in comparison to alkanes and thus, alkenes can be changed into single bond compounds by combining with the electrophilic reagents. Strength of the double bond (bond enthalpy, 681 kJ mol\n–1) is greater \nthan that of a carbon-carbon single bond in ethane (bond enthalpy, 348 kJ mol\n–1). Orbital \ndiagrams of ethene molecule are shown in  \nFigs. 9.4 and 9.5.\n9.3.2  nomenclature\nFo\nr nomenclature of alkenes in IUPAC system, \nthe longest chain of carbon atoms containing \nthe double bond is selected.

If the two atoms or groups attached to each carbon atom are different, they can be represented by YX C = C XY like structure.  \nYX C = C XY can be represented in space in the following two ways : In (a), the two identical atoms i.e., both \nthe X or both the Y lie on the same side of the double bond but in (b) the two X or two Y lie acr\noss the double bond or on the \nopposite sides of the double bond. This results in different geometry of (a) and (b) i.e. disposition of atoms or groups in space in the two arrangements is different. Therefore, they are stereoisomers. They would have the same geometry if atoms or groups around C=C bond can be rotated but rotation around C=C bond is not free. It is restricted. For understanding this concept, take two pieces of strong cardboards and join them with the help of two nails. Hold one cardboard in your one hand and try to rotate the other. Can you really rotate the other cardboard ? The answer is no. The rotation is restricted. This illustrates that the restricted rotation of atoms or groups around the doubly bonded carbon atoms gives rise to different geometries of such compounds. The stereoisomers of this type are called geometrical isomers. The isomer of the type (a), in which two identical atoms or groups lie on the same side of the double bond is called cis  isomer and the \nother isomer of the type (b), in which identical atoms or groups lie on the opposite sides of the double bond is called trans isomer . Thus \ncis and trans isomers have the same structure \nbut have different configuration (arrangement of atoms or groups in space). Due to different arrangement of atoms or groups in space, these isomers differ in their properties like melting point, boiling point, dipole moment, solubility etc. Geometrical or cis-trans isomers of but-2-ene are represented below :\n Cis form of alkene is found to be more \npolar than the trans\n form. For example, \ndipole moment of cis-but-2-ene is 0.33 Debye, whereas, dipole moment of the trans form  \nis almost zero or it can be said that  \nUnit 9.indd   308 03-05-2024   16:07:55\nReprint 2025-26\n\n309\nHydrocarbons\ntrans-but-2-ene is non-polar. This can be \nunderstood by drawing geometries of the two forms as given below from which it is clear that in the trans-but-2-ene, the two methyl \ngroups are in opposite directions, Threfore, dipole moments of C-CH\n3 bonds cancel, thus  \nmaking the trans form non-polar.

From alkynes: Alkynes on partial\n \nreduction with calculated amount of \ndihydrogen in the presence of palladised \ncharcoal partially deactivated with poisons like sulphur compounds or quinoline give alkenes. Partially deactivated palladised charcoal is known as Lindlar’s catalyst. Alkenes thus obtained are having cis  \ngeometry.

From alcohols by acidic dehydration: Y\nou have read during nomenclature of \ndifferent homologous series in Unit 12 that alcohols are the hydroxy derivatives of alkanes. They are represented by R–OH where, R is C\nnH2n+1. Alcohols on heating \nwith concentrated sulphuric acid form alkenes with the elimination of one water molecule. Since a water molecule is eliminated from the alcohol molecule in the presence of an acid, this reaction is known as acidic dehydration of alcohols. \nThis reaction is also the example of   \nβ-elimination reaction since –OH group takes out one hydrogen atom from the  \nβ-carbon atom.\n(9.37)\n9.3.5  Properties\nPhysical propertiesA\nlkenes as a class resemble alkanes in \nphysical properties, except in types of isomerism and difference in polar nature. The first three members are gases, the next fourteen are liquids and the higher ones are solids. Ethene is a colourless gas with a faint sweet smell. All other alkenes are colourless and odourless, insoluble in water but fairly soluble in non-polar solvents like benzene, petroleum ether. They show a regular increase in boiling point with increase in size i.e., every – CH\n2 group added increases boiling point by \n20–30 K. Like alkanes, straight chain alkenes have higher boiling point than isomeric branched chain compounds.\nChemical properties\nAlkenes are the rich source of loosely held  \npi (π) electrons, due to which they show \naddition reactions in which the electrophiles add on to the carbon-carbon double bond to form the addition products.  Some reagents also add by free radical mechanism. There are cases when under special conditions, alkenes also undergo free radical substitution reactions. Oxidation and ozonolysis reactions are also quite prominent in alkenes. A brief description of different reactions of alkenes is given  below:\n1.\n Addi\ntion of dihydrogen: Alkenes add \nup one molecule of dihydrogen gas in \nthe presence of finely divided nickel, palladium or platinum to form alkanes (Section 9.2.2)\n2.\n Addition of halogens : Halogens like \nbromine or chlorine add up to alkene to for\nm vicinal dihalides. However, iodine \ndoes not show addition reaction under \nUnit 9.indd   310 03-05-2024   16:08:27\nReprint 2025-26\n\n311\nHydrocarbons\nnormal conditions. The reddish orange \ncolour of bromine solution in carbon tetrachloride is discharged when bromine adds up to an unsaturation site. This reaction is used as a test for unsaturation. Addition of halogens to alkenes is an example of electrophilic addition reaction involving cyclic halonium ion formation which you will study in higher classes.\n(9.38)\n \n(9.39)\n3. Addition of hydrogen halides: Hydrogen\n \nhalides (HCl, HBr,HI) add up to alkenes \nto form alkyl halides. The order of reactivity of the hydrogen halides is  \nHI > HBr > HCl. Like addition of halogens to alkenes, addition of hydrogen halides is also an example of electrophilic addition reaction. Let us illustrate this by taking addition of HBr to symmetrical and \nunsymmetrical alkenes \nAddition reaction of HBr to symmetrical \nalkenesAddition reactions of HBr to symmetrical alkenes (similar groups attached to double bond) take place by electrophilic addition mechanism. \nCH\n2=CH2+H–Br  CH3–CH2–Br (9.40)\nCH3–CH=CH–CH3+HBr  CH3–CH–CHCH3 \n Br\n(9.41)\nAddition reaction of HBr to unsymmetrical \nalkenes (Markovnikov Rule)How will \nH – Br add to propene ? The two \npossible products are I and II.(9.42)\nMarkovnikov, a Russian chemist made a generalisation in 1869 after studying such reactions in detail. These generalisations led Markovnikov to frame a rule called Markovnikov rule. The rule states that negative part of the addendum (adding molecule) gets attached to that carbon atom which possesses lesser number of hydrogen atoms. Thus according to this rule, product I i.e., 2-bromopropane is expected. In actual \npractice, this is the principal product of the reaction. This generalisation of Markovnikov rule can be better understood in terms of mechanism of the reaction.\nMechanism \nHydrogen bromide provides an electrophile, H\n+, which attacks the double bond to form \ncarbocation as shown below :\n(i)  The secondary carbocation (b) is more stable than the primary carbocation (a), ther\nefore, the former predominates \nbecause it is formed at a faster rate.\n(ii)  The carbocation (b) is attacked by Br– ion \nto form the  product as follows :\n2-Bromopropane \n(major product)(a) less stable \nprimary carbocation(b) more stable\n secondary carbocation\nUnit 9.indd   311 10/27/2022   2:19:43 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\n312\nchemistry\nAnti Markovnikov addition or peroxide \neffect or Kharash effect\nIn the presence of peroxide, addition of HBr to unsymmetrical alkenes like propene takes place contrary to the Markovnikov rule. This happens only with HBr but not with HCl and Hl. This addition reaction was observed  \nby M.S. Kharash and F.R. Mayo in 1933 at the University of Chicago. This reaction is known as peroxide or Kharash effect  \nor addition reaction anti to Markovnikov  \nrule.\nCH\n3 – CH=CH2+HBr (C6H5CO)2O2 CH3–CH2 \nCH2Br\n1–Bromopropane\n(9.43)\nMechanism : Peroxide effect proceeds via \nfree radical chain mechanism as given below:\n(ii) C.\n   6H5+H–Br Homolysis C6H3+ B.\n   r The secondary free radical obtained in the \nabove mechanism (step iii) is mor\ne stable than \nthe primary. This explains the formation of  \n1-bromopropane as the major product. It may \nbe noted that the peroxide effect is not observed in addition of HCl and HI. This may be due  \nto the fact that the H–Cl bond being  \nstronger (430.5 kJ mol\n–1) than H–Br bond  \n(363.7 kJ mol–1), is not cleaved by the  free \nradical, whereas the H–I bond is weaker  \n(296.8 kJ mol–1) and iodine free radicals \ncombine to form iodine molecules instead of adding to the double bond. \nProblem 9.12\nWrite IUPAC names of the products \nobtained by addition reactions of HBr to  hex-1-ene \n(i)\n in the absence of peroxide and   \n(ii) in the presence of peroxide.\nsolution\n4.

Polymerisa\ntion: You are familiar with \npolythene bags and polythene sheets. \nPolythene is obtained by the combination of large number of ethene molecules at high temperature, high pressure and in the presence of a catalyst.

Though these materials have now become common, excessive use of polythene and polypropylene is a matter of great concern for all of us.\n9.4\n Alkynes\nLike alkenes, alkynes are also unsaturated \nhy\ndrocarbons. They contain at least one triple \nbond between two carbon atoms. The number of hydrogen atoms is still less in alkynes as compared to alkenes or alkanes. Their general formula is C\nnH2n–2. \n The first stable member \nof alkyne series \nis ethyne which is popularly known as acetylene. Acetylene is used for arc welding purposes in the form of oxyacetylene flame obtained by mixing acetylene with oxygen gas. Alkynes are starting materials for a large number of organic compounds. Hence, it is interesting to study this class of organic compounds.\n9.4.1\n nomenclature and Isomerism\nIn common system, alkynes are named as\n \nderivatives of acetylene. In IUPAC system, they are named as derivatives of the corresponding \nalkanes replacing ‘ane’ by the suffix ‘yne’. The position of the triple bond is indicated by the first triply bonded carbon. Common and IUPAC names of a few members of alkyne series are given in Table 9.2.\n You have already learnt that ethyne and \npr\nopyne have got only one structure but \nthere are two possible structures for butyne –  \n(i) but-1-yne and (ii) but-2-yne. Since these two compounds differ in their structures due to the position of the triple bond, they are known as position isomers. In how many ways, you can construct the structure for the next homologue i.e., the next alkyne with molecular formula  C\n5H8? Let us try to \narrange five carbon atoms with a continuous chain and with a side chain.

Structure of ethyne is shown in  \nFig. 9.6.\n Each carbon atom of ethyne has two sp\n \nhybridised orbitals. Carbon-carbon sigma (σ) bond is obtained by the head-on overlapping of the two sp hybridised orbitals of the two carbon atoms. The remaining sp hybridised orbital of each carbon atom undergoes overlapping along the internuclear axis with the 1s  orbital of each of the two hydrogen \natoms forming two C-H sigma bonds. H-C-C bond angle is of 180°. Each carbon has two unhybridised p orbitals which are \nperpendicular to each other as well as to the plane of the C-C sigma bond. The 2p orbitals of one carbon atom are parallel to the 2p orbitals of the other carbon atom, which \nundergo lateral or sideways overlapping to form two pi (π) bonds between two carbon atoms. Thus ethyne molecule consists of one C–C σ bond,  two C–H σ bonds and two C–C \nπ bonds. The strength of C≡ C bond (bond \nenthalpy 823 kJ mol\n-1) is more than those \nof C=C bond (bond enthalpy 681 kJ mol–1) \nand C–C bond (bond enthalpy 348 kJ mol–1). \nThe C≡ C bond length is shorter (120 pm) \nthan those of C=C (133 pm) and C–C (154 pm). Electron cloud between two carbon atoms is cylindrically symmetrical about the internuclear axis. Thus, ethyne is a linear molecule.\n9.4.3\n Preparation\n1. From calcium carbide: On industrial \nscale, ethyne is pr\nepared by treating \ncalcium carbide with water. Calcium \ncarbide is prepared by heating quick lime with coke. Quick lime can be obtained by heating limestone as shown in the following  \nreactions:\nCaCO\n3 ∆ CaO + O2 (9.55)Fig. 9.6  Orbital picture of ethyne showing  \n(a) sigma overlaps (b) pi overlaps.\nUnit 9.indd   315 11/10/2022   15:27:49\nReprint 2025-26\n\n316\nchemistry\nCaO + 3C   CaC2 + CO (9.56)\n  Calcium \n  carbide\nCaC2 + 2H2O   Ca(OH)2 + C2H2 (9.57)\n2. From vicinal dihalides : V\nicinal dihalides \non treatment with alcoholic potassium \nhydroxide undergo dehydrohalogenation. One molecule of hydrogen halide is eliminated to form alkenyl halide which on treatment with sodamide gives alkyne.\n9.4.4  Properties\nPhysical properties\nPhysical pr\noperties of alkynes follow the same \ntrend of alkenes and alkanes. First three members are gases, the next eight are liquids and the higher ones are solids. All alkynes are colourless. Ethyene has characteristic odour. Other members are odourless. Alkynes are weakly polar in nature. They are lighter than water and immiscible with water but soluble in organic solvents like ethers, carbon tetrachloride and benzene. Their  melting point, boiling point and density increase with increase in molar mass.\nChemical properties\nAlkynes show acidic nature, addition reactions and polymerisation reactions as follows : \nA.\n Acidic character of alkyne: Sodium\n \nmetal and sodamide (NaNH2) are strong \nbases. They react with ethyne to form sodium \nacetylide with the liberation of dihydrogen gas. These reactions have not been observed in case of ethene and ethane thus indicating that ethyne is acidic in nature in comparison to ethene and ethane. Why is it so ? Has it something to do with their structures and the hybridisation ? You have read that \nhydrogen atoms in ethyne are attached to the sp hybridised carbon atoms whereas \nthey are attached to sp\n2 hybridised carbon \natoms in ethene and sp3 hybridised carbons \nin ethane. Due to the maximum percentage of \ns character (50%), the sp hybridised orbitals \nof carbon atoms in ethyne molecules have  highest electronegativity; hence, these attract the shared electron pair of the C-H bond of ethyne to a greater extent than that of the sp\n2 hybridised orbitals of carbon in ethene \nand the sp3 hybridised orbital of carbon in \nethane. Thus in ethyne, hydrogen atoms can be liberated as protons more easily as compared to ethene and ethane. Hence, hydrogen atoms of ethyne attached to triply bonded carbon atom are acidic in nature. You may note that the hydrogen atoms attached to the triply bonded carbons are acidic but not all the hydrogen atoms of alkynes. \nHC ≡ CH + Na → HC ≡ C\n–Na++ 1/2 H2\n Monosodium\n ethynide\n(9.59)\nHC ≡ C– Na  + Na →  Na+ C–Na+ ≡ C–Na++ 1/2 H2\n Disodium ethynide\n(9.60)\nCH3 – C ≡ C – H   +   Na+ NH–\n2\n ↓\nCH3 – C ≡ C– Na+  +   NH3\nSodium propynide  (9.61)\nThese r\neactions are not shown by alkenes \nand alkanes, hence used for distinction \nbetween alkynes, alkenes and alkanes.

Addition reactions: Alkynes contain a  \ntriple bond, so they add up, two molecules of \ndihydrogen, halogen, hydrogen halides etc. Formation of the addition product takes place according to the following steps. \nUnit 9.indd   316 10/10/2022   10:37:57 AM\nReprint 2025-26\n\n317\nHydrocarbons\n \n The addition product formed depends\n \nupon stability of vinylic cation.

Three \nmolecules polymerise to form benzene, which is the starting molecule for the preparation of derivatives of benzene, dyes, drugs and large number of other organic compounds. This is the best route for entering from aliphatic to aromatic compounds as discussed below:\n                                   \n(9.69)\nProblem 9.14\nHow will you convert ethanoic acid into \nbenzene?\nSolution\n9.5 Arom Atic Hydroc Arbon\nThese hydrocarbons are also known as\n \n‘arenes’. Since most of them possess pleasant \nodour (Greek; aroma meaning pleasant \nsmelling), the class of compounds was named as ‘aromatic compounds’. Most of such compounds were found to contain benzene ring. Benzene ring is highly unsaturated but in a majority of reactions of aromatic compounds, the unsaturation of benzene ring is retained. However, there are examples of aromatic hydrocarbons which do not contain a benzene ring but instead contain other highly unsaturated ring.  Aromatic compounds containing benzene ring are known as benzenoids and those not containing a benzene ring are known as non-benzenoids. Some examples of arenes are given  \nbelow:\n    Benzene          Toluene  Naphthalene\nBiphenyl\n9.5.1 nomenclature and isomerism\nThe nomenclature and isomerism of aromatic\n \nhydrocarbons has already been discussed in \nUnit 8. All six hydrogen atoms in benzene are equivalent; so it forms one and only one type of monosubstituted product. When two hydrogen atoms in benzene are replaced by two similar or different monovalent atoms or groups, three different position isomers are possible. The 1, 2 or 1, 6 is known as the ortho  \n(o–), the 1, 3 or 1, 5 as meta (m–) and the 1, \n4 as para (p–) disubstituted compounds. A few examples of derivatives of benzene are given below:\n Methylbenzene  1,2-Dimethylbenzene\n (Toluene)   (o-Xylene)\nUnit 9.indd   318 11/10/2022   15:28:31\nReprint 2025-26\n\n319\nHydrocarbons\n1,3 Dimethylbenzene  1,4-Dimethylbenzene\n (m\n-Xylene)               (  p-Xylene)\n9.5.2 structure of benzene\nBenzene was isolated by Michael Faraday \nin 1825. The molecular for\nmula of benzene, \nC6H6, indicates a high degree of unsaturation. \nThis molecular formula did not account for its relationship to corresponding alkanes, alkenes and alkynes which you have studied in earlier sections of this unit. What do you think about its possible structure? Due to its unique properties and unusual stability, it took several years to assign its structure. Benzene was found to be a stable molecule and found to form a triozonide which indicates the presence of three double bonds. Benzene was further found to produce one and only one \nmonosubstituted derivative which indicated that all the six carbon and six hydrogen atoms of benzene are identical. On the basis of this observation August Kekulé in 1865 proposed the following structure for benzene having cyclic arrangement of six carbon atoms with alternate single and double bonds and one hydrogen atom attached to each carbon atom.\n \n The Kekulé  structure indicates  \nthe possibility of two isomeric   \n1, 2-dibromobenzenes. In one of the isomers, \nthe bromine atoms are attached to the doubly bonded carbon atoms whereas in the other, they are attached to the singly bonded \ncarbons.Friedrich August Kekulé,a German chemist was born in 1829 at Darmsdt in \nGermany. He became Professor in 1856 and Fellow of Royal Society in 1875. He made major contribution to structural organic chemistry by proposing in 1858 that carbon atoms can join to one another to form chains and later in 1865,he found an answer to the challenging problem of benzene structure by suggesting that these chains can close to form rings. He gave the dynamic structural  formula to benzene which forms the basis for its modern electronic structure. He described the discovery of benzene structure later as:\n “I was sitti\nng writing at my textbook,but the work did not progress; my thoughts \nwere elsewhere. I turned my chair to the fire, and dozed. Again the atoms were gambolling before my eyes. This time the smaller groups kept modestly in the background. My mental eye, rendered more acute by repeated visions of this kind, could now distinguish larger structures of manifold  conformations; long rows,sometimes more closely fitted together; all twisting and turning in snake like motion. But look! What was that? One of the snakes had seized hold of it’s own tail, and the form whirled mockingly before my eyes. As if by a flash of lightning I woke;.... I spent the rest of the night working out the consequences of the hypothesis. Let us learn to dream, gentlemen, and then perhaps we shall learn the truth but let us beware of making our dreams public before they have been approved by the waking mind.”( 1890).\n One hundred years later, on the occasion of Kekulé’s centenary celebrations a gr\noup of compounds \nhaving polybenzenoid structures have been named as Kekulenes.  FRIEDRICH \nAUGUST KEKULÉ\n(7th September \n1829–13th July \n1896)\nUnit 9.indd   319 10/10/2022   10:37:58 AM\nReprint 2025-26\n\n320\nchemistry\n \n However, benzene was found to form only \none ortho disubstituted product. This pr\noblem \nwas overcome by Kekulé by suggesting the \nconcept of oscillating nature of double bonds in benzene as given below.\n Even with this modification, Kekulé \nstructure of benzene  fails to explain unusual\n \nstability and preference to substitution  reactions than addition reactions, which could later on be explained by resonance.\nResonance and stability of benzene\nAccording to Valence Bond Theory, the \nconcept of oscillating double bonds in benzene is now explained by resonance. Benzene is a hybrid of various resonating structures. The two structures, A and B given by Kekulé  are \nthe main contributing structures. The hybrid structure is represented by inserting a circle or a dotted circle in the hexagon as shown in (C). The circle represents the six electrons which are delocalised between the six carbon atoms of the benzene ring.\n   (A)     (B)                               (C)\n The orbital overlapping gives us better \npicture \nabout the structure of benzene. All \nthe six carbon atoms in benzene are sp2 \nhybridized. Two sp2 hybrid orbitals of each \ncarbon atom overlap with sp2 hybrid orbitals \nof adjacent carbon atoms to form six C—C \nsigma bonds which are in the hexagonal plane. The remaining sp2 hybrid orbital of \neach carbon atom overlaps with s  orbital \nof a hydrogen atom to form six C—H sigma \nbonds. Each carbon atom is now left with one unhybridised p orbital perpendicular to the \nplane of the ring as shown below:\n The unhybridised p  orbital of carbon atoms \nare close enough to for\nm a π bond by lateral \noverlap. There are two equal possibilities of forming three π bonds by overlap of p orbitals \nof C\n1 –C2, C3  – C4, C5  – C6 or C2  – C3, C4  – C5, \nC6  – C1 respectively as shown in the following \nfigures.\nFig. 9.7 (a)\nFig. 9.7 (b)\n Structures shown in Fig. 9.7(a) and (b) \ncorrespond to two Kekulé’s structur\ne with \nlocalised π bonds. The internuclear distance \nUnit 9.indd   320 11/10/2022   15:29:07\nReprint 2025-26\n\n321\nHydrocarbons\nbetween all the carbon atoms in the ring has \nbeen determined by the X-ray diffraction to be the same; there is equal probability for the p orbital of each carbon atom to overlap with the p orbitals of adjacent carbon atoms [Fig. \n9.7 (c)]. This can be represented in the form of two doughtnuts (rings) of electron clouds [Fig. 9.7 (d)], one above and one below the plane of the hexagonal ring as shown below:\n Fig. 9.7 (c)                     Fig. 9.7 (d)\n The six π  electrons are thus delocalised  \nand can move freely about the six carbon nuclei, instead of any two as shown in  \nFig. 9.6 (a) or (b). The delocalised π  electron cloud \nis attracted more strongly by the nuclei of the carbon atoms than the electron cloud localised between two carbon atoms. Therefore, presence of delocalised π  electrons in benzene makes  \nit more stable than the hypothetical cyclohexatriene.\n X-Ray diffraction data reveals that benzene \nis a planar molecule. Had any one of the above\n \nstructures of benzene (A or B) been correct, \ntwo types of C—C bond lengths were expected. However, X-ray data indicates that all the six C—C bond lengths are of the same order  \n(139 pm) which is  intermediate between  \nC— C single bond (154 pm) and C—C double bond (133 pm). Thus the absence of pure double bond in benzene accounts for the reluctance of benzene to show addition reactions under normal conditions, thus \nexplaining the unusual behaviour of benzene.\n9.5.3 Aromaticity\nBenzene was considered as parent ‘aromatic’ \ncompound. Now, the name is applied to all the ring systems whether or not having benzene ring, possessing following characteristics.(i)\n Planarity\n(ii) Complete delocalisation of the π electrons in the ring\n(iii) Pr\nesence of (4n + 2) π electrons in the ring \nwhere n is an integer (n = 0, 1, 2, . . .). \n This is often referred to as Hückel Rule\n.\nSome examples of aromatic compounds are given below:\n \n          \n9.5.4  Preparation of Benzene\nBenzene is commercially isolated from coal tar\n. However, it may be prepared in the \nlaboratory by the following methods.\n(i) Cyclic polymerisation of ethyne:  \n(Section 9.4.4)\n(ii) Decarboxylation of aromatic acids: \nSodium salt of benzoic acid on heating with sodalime gives benzene.\n(9.70)(electron cloud)\nUnit 9.indd   321 10/27/2022   2:18:31 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n\n322\nchemistry\n(iii) Reduction of phenol: Phenol is reduced \nto benzene by passing its vapours over \nheated zinc dust \n \n(9.71)\n9.5.5 Properties\nPhysical properties \nAromatic hydr\nocarbons are non- polar  \nmolecules and are usually colourless liquids or solids with a characteristic aroma. You are also familiar with naphthalene balls which are used in toilets and for preservation of clothes because of unique smell of the compound and the moth repellent property. Aromatic hydrocarbons are immiscible with water but are readily miscible with organic solvents. They burn with sooty flame.\nChemical properties \nArenes are characterised by electrophilic substitution reactions. However, under special conditions they can also undergo addition and oxidation reactions.\nElectrophilic substitution reactions\nThe common electrophilic substitution reactions of arenes are nitration, halogenation, sulphonation, Friedel Craft’s alkylation and acylation reactions in which attacking reagent is an electrophile (E\n+)\n(i) Nitrati\non: A nitro group is introduced \ninto benzene ring when benzene is heated with a mixture of concentrated nitric acid and concentrated sulphuric acid (nitrating mixture).\n (9.72)\n               Nitrobenzene(ii) Halogenation: Arenes react with halogens\n \nin the presence of a Lewis acid like anhydrous FeCl\n3, FeBr3 or AlCl3 to yield haloarenes.\nChlorobenzene\n (9.73)\n(iii) Sulphonation: The replacement of a \nhydr\nogen atom by a sulphonic acid group in \na ring is called sulphonation. It is carried out by heating benzene with fuming sulphuric acid (oleum).\n(9.74)\n(iv) Friedel-Crafts alkylation reaction:  \nWhen benzene is treated with an alkyl halide in the presence of anhydr\nous aluminium \nchloride, alkylbenene is formed.\n (9.75)\n \n(9.76)\n Why do we get isopropyl benzene on \ntreating benzene with 1-chlor\nopropane \ninstead of n-propyl benzene?\n(v) Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction: The \nr\neaction of benzene with an acyl halide or \nacid anhydride in the presence of Lewis acids \n(AlCl3) yields acyl benzene.\nUnit 9.indd   322 12/13/2022   10:16:03\nReprint 2025-26\n\n323\nHydrocarbons\n(9.77)\n (9.78)\n If excess of electrophilic reagent is used, \nfurther substitution reaction may take place \nin which other hydr\nogen atoms of benzene \nring may also be successively replaced by the electrophile. For example, benzene on treatment with excess of chlorine in the presence of anhydrous AlCl\n3 can be \nchlorinated to hexachlorobenzene (C6Cl6)\n \n  (9.79)\nMechanism of electrophilic substitution reactions:Accor\nding to experimental evidences, SE (S = \nsubstitution; E = electrophilic) reactions are \nsupposed to proceed via the following three steps:\n(a)\n Generation of the eletrophile \n(b) Formation of carbocation intermediate\n(c) Removal of proton from the carbocation \nintermediate\n(a) Generation of electrophile E⊕: During \nchlorination, alkylation and acylation of benzene, anhydrous AlCl\n3, being a Lewis acid \nhelps in generation of the elctrophile Cl⊕, R⊕, \nRC⊕O (acylium ion) respectively by combining \nwith the attacking reagent.  In the case of nitration, the electrophile, \nnitronium ion,  is produced by transfer of \na proton (from sulphuric acid) to nitric acid \nin the following manner:\nStep I  \nStep II\n Protonated  Nitronium\n nitric acid  ion\n It i\ns interesting to note that in the process \nof generation of nitronium ion, sulphuric acid \nserves as an acid and nitric acid as a base. Thus, it is a simple acid-base equilibrium.\n(b)\n Formation of Carbocation   \n (arenium ion): Attack of electrophile\n \nresults in the formation of σ -complex or \narenium ion in which one of the carbon is sp3 \nhybridised.\n   sigma complex (arenium ion)\n The arenium ion  gets stabilised by \nresonance:\nUnit 9.indd   323 12/1/2022   11:04:17\nReprint 2025-26\n\n324\nchemistry\n Sigma complex or arenium ion loses its \naromatic character because delocalisation of \nelectr\nons stops at sp3 hybridised carbon.\n(c)  Rem\noval of proton: To restore the \naromatic character, σ  -complex releases \nproton from sp3 hybridised carbon on attack \nby [AlCl4]– (in case of halogenation, alkylation \nand acylation) and [HSO4]– (in case of \nnitration).\nAddition reactionsUnder  vigorous conditions, i.e., at high temperature and/ or pressure in the presence of nickel catalyst, hydrogenation of benzene gives cyclohexane.\n  \n Cyclohexane\n(9.80)\n Under ultra-violet light, three chlorine \nmolecules add to benzene to pr\noduce benzene \nhexachloride, C6H6Cl6 which is also called \ngammaxane.\nBenzene hexachloride, \n    \n  (BHC)\n(9.81)\nCombustion: When heated in air, benzene\n \nburns with sooty flame producing CO2 and \nH2O\n6 2 22615CH O\n26CO +3H O + →\n (9.82)\nGene\nral combustion reaction for any \nhydrocarbon may be given by the following chemical equation:\nCxHy + (x + ) O2 → x CO2 +  H2O  n (9.83)\n9.5.6  directive influence of a functional \ngr\noup in monosubstituted benzene\nWhen monosubstituted benzene is subjected \nto further substitution, three possible disubstituted products are not formed in equal amounts. Two types of behaviour are observed. Either ortho and para products or meta product is predominantly formed. It \nhas also been observed that this behaviour depends on the nature of the substituent already present in the benzene ring and not on the nature of the entering group. This is known as directive influence of substituents. Reasons for ortho/ para or meta directive \nnature of groups are discussed below:\nOrtho and para directing groups: The \ngroups which direct the incoming group to \northo and para positions are called ortho and \npara directing groups. As an example, let us discuss the directive influence of phenolic  \n(–OH) group. Phenol is resonance hybrid of \nfollowing structures:\nIt is clear from the above resonating \nstructures that the electron density is more on  \no – and p – positions. Hence, the substitution \ntakes place mainly at these positions. However, it may be noted that –I effect of – OH group also operates due to which the electron density on ortho and para positions of the benzene ring \nis slightly reduced. But the overall electron density increases at  these positions of the ring due to resonance. Therefore, –OH group \nactivates the benzene ring for the attack by \nUnit 9.indd   324 10/10/2022   10:38:01 AM\nReprint 2025-26\n\n325\nHydrocarbons\nan electrophile. Other examples of activating \ngroups are –NH2, –NHR, –NHCOCH3, –OCH3,  \n–CH3, –C2H5, etc.\nIn the case of aryl halides, halogens are \nmoderately deactivating. Because of their  \nstrong – I effect, overall electron density on benzene ring decreases. It makes further substitution difficult. However, due to resonance the electron density on o – and \np– positions is greater than that at the \nm-position. Hence, they are also o–  and p–  \ndirecting groups. Resonance structures of chlorobenzene are given below:In this case, the overall electron density \non benzene ring decreases making further substitution difficult, therefore these groups are also called ‘deactivating groups’. The electron density on o – and p– position \nis comparatively less than that at meta  \nposition. Hence, the electrophile attacks on comparatively electron rich meta position resulting in meta substitution.\n9.6 \ncarcinog Enicity and toxicity\nBen\nzene and polynuclear hydrocarbons \ncontaining more than two benzene rings \nfused together are toxic and said to possess cancer producing (carcinogenic) property. Such polynuclear hydrocarbons are formed on incomplete combustion of organic materials like tobacco, coal and petroleum. They enter into human body and undergo various biochemical reactions and finally damage DNA and cause cancer. Some of the carcinogenic hydrocarbons are given below (see box).\nMeta directing group:  The groups which \ndirect the incoming group to meta  position are \ncalled meta directing groups. Some examples \nof meta directing groups are –NO2, –CN, –CHO, \n–COR, –COOH, –COOR, –SO3H, etc. \n Let us take the example \nof nitro group. \nNitro group reduces the electron density in the benzene ring due to its strong–I effect. Nitrobenzene is a resonance hybrid of the following structures.\nUnit 9.indd   325 10/10/2022   10:38:01 AM\nReprint 2025-26\n\n326\nchemistry\nsUMM ary\nHydrocarbons are the compounds of carbon and hydrogen only. Hydrocarbons are mainly \nobtained from coal and petroleum, which are the major sources of energy. Petrochemicals \nare the prominent starting materials used for the manufacture of a large number of commercially important products. LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) and  CNG (compressed natural gas), the main sources of energy for domestic fuels and the automobile industry, are obtained from petroleum. Hydrocarbons are classified as open chain saturated (alkanes) \nand unsaturated (alkenes and alkynes), cyclic (alicyclic) and aromatic, according to their \nstructure. \nThe important reactions of alkanes are free radical substitution, combustion, oxidation  \nand aromatization. Alkenes and alkynes undergo addition reactions, which are mainly \nelectrophilic additions . Aromatic hydrocarbons, despite having unsaturation, undergo \nmainly electrophilic substitution reactions. These undergo addition reactions only under \nspecial conditions. \nAlkanes show conformational isomerism due to free rotation along the C–C sigma \nbonds. Out of staggered and the eclipsed conformations of ethane, staggered conformation \nis more stable as hydrogen atoms are farthest apart. Alkenes exhibit geometrical  \n(cis-trans) isomerism due to restricted rotation around the carbon–carbon double bond. \nbenz\nene and benzenoid  compounds show aromatic character. Aromaticity, the \nproperty of being aromatic is possessed by compounds having specific electronic structure characterised by Hückel (4n+2)π  electron rule. The nature of groups or substituents attached \nto benzene ring is responsible for activation or deactivation of the benzene ring towards further electrophilic substitution and also for orientation of the incoming group. Some of the polynuclear hydrocarbons having fused benzene ring system have carcinogenic property. \nExErcis Es\n9.1  How do you account for the formation of ethane during chlorination of methane ?\n9.2 Write IUPAC names of the following compounds : \n (a) CH3CH=C(CH3)2  (b) CH2=CH-C≡C-CH3\n (c)    (d) –CH2–CH2–CH=CH2\n (e)    (f) CH3(CH2)4 CH (CH2)3 CH3\n \n CH2 –CH (CH3)2\n (g) CH3 – CH = CH – CH2 – CH = CH – CH – CH2 – CH = CH2\n  |\n  C2H5\n9.3 For the following compounds, write structural formulas and IUPAC names for all possible isomers having the number of double or triple bond as indicated : \n (a)  C4H8 (one double bond)    (b)   C5H8 (one triple bond)\n9.4 Write IUPAC names of the pr\noducts obtained by the ozonolysis of the following \ncompounds :\n (i) Pent-2-ene   \n  (ii)  3,4-Dimethylhept-3-ene\n (iii)  2-Ethylbut-1-ene   \n (iv)  1-Phenylbut-1-ene\nUnit 9.indd   326 10/10/2022   10:38:01 AM\nReprint 2025-26\n\n327\nHydrocarbons\n9.5 An alkene ‘A’ on ozonolysis gives a mixture of ethanal and pentan-3-one. \nWrite structur\ne and IUPAC name of ‘A’.\n9.6 An alkene ‘A’ \ncontains three C – C, eight C – H σ bonds and one C – C π \nbond. ‘A’ on ozonolysis gives two moles of an aldehyde of molar mass 44 u.
