The limit of f (x) as x tends\nto zero is to be thought of as the value f (x) should assume at x = 0.\nIn general as x → a, f (x) → l, then l is called limit of the function f  (x) which is\nsymbolically written as () lim\nx af x l\n→=.\nConsider the following function g(x) = |x|, x ≠0. Observe that g (0) is not defined.\nComputing the value of g(x) for values of x very\nnear to 0, we see that the value of g(x) moves\ntowards 0. So, 0lim\nx→ g(x) = 0. This is intuitively\nclear from the graph of y = |x| for x ≠0.\n(See Fig 2.13, Chapter 2).\nConsider the following function.\n( )24, 22xh x xx−= ≠−.\nCompute the value of h(x) for values  of\nx very near to 2 (but not at 2). Convince yourself\nthat all these values are near to 4. This is\nsomewhat strengthened by considering the graph\nof the function y = h(x) given here (Fig 12.2). Fig 12.2\nReprint 2025-26\n\n  LIMITS AND DERIVATIVES            221\nIn all these illustrations the value which the function should assume at a given\npoint x = a did not really depend on how  is x tending to a. Note that there are essentially\ntwo ways x could approach a number a  either from left or from right, i.e., all the\nvalues of x near a could be less than a or could be greater than a. This naturally leads\nto two limits – the right hand limit  and the left hand limit . Right hand limit of a\nfunction f(x) is that value of f(x) which is dictated by the values of f(x) when x tends\nto a from the right. Similarly , the left hand limit . To illustrate this, consid er the function\n( )1, 0\n2, 0xf xx≤ => \nGraph of this function is shown in the Fig 12.3. It is\nclear that the value of f at 0 dictated by values of f(x) with\nx ≤ 0 equals 1, i.e., the left hand limit of f (x) at 0 is\n0lim ( ) 1\nxf x\n→=.\nSimilarly , the value of f at 0 dictated by values of\nf (x) with x > 0 equals 2, i.e., the right hand limit of f (x)\nat 0 is\n0lim ( ) 2\nxf x\n+→=.\nIn this case the right and left hand limits are different, and hence we say that the\nlimit of f (x) as x tends to zero does not exist (even though the function is defined at 0).\nSummary\n  We say lim\nx a→– f(x) is the expected value of  f at x = a given the values of f near\nx to the left of a. This value is called the left hand limit  of f at a.\nWe say lim ( )\nx af x\n+→ is the expected value of f at x = a given the values of\nf near x to the right of a. This value is called the right hand limit of f(x) at a.\nIf the right and left hand limits coincide, we call that common value as the limit\nof f(x) at x = a and denote it by lim\nx a→ f(x).\nIllustration 1  Consider the function f(x) = x + 10. We want to find the limit of this\nfunction at x = 5. Let us compute the value of the function f(x) for x very near to 5.\nSome   of the points near and to the left of 5 are 4.9, 4.95, 4.99, 4.995. . ., etc. Values\nof the function at these points are tabulated below . Similarly , the real number 5.001,Fig 12.3\nReprint 2025-26\n\n222 MATHEMA TICS\n5.01, 5.1 are also points near and to the right of 5. Values of the function at these points\nare also given in the Table 12.4.\nTable 12.4\nFrom the Table 12.4, we deduce that value of f(x) at \nx = 5 should be greater than\n14.995 and less than 15.001 assuming nothing dramatic happens between x = 4.995\nand 5.001. It is reasonable to assume that the value of the f(x) at x = 5 as dictated by\nthe numbers to the left of 5 is 15, i.e.,\n()–5lim 15\nxf x\n→= .\nSimilarly , when x approaches 5 from the right,  f(x) should be taking value 15 , i.e.,\n()\n5lim 15\nxf x\n+→= .\nHence, it is likely that the left hand limit of f(x) and the right hand limit of f(x) are\nboth equal to 15. Thus,\n() () ()\n5 5 5lim lim lim 15\nx x xf x f x f x\n− +→ → →= = = .\nThis conclusion about the limit being equal to 15 is somewhat strengthened by\nseeing the graph of this function which is given in Fig 2.16, Chapter 2. In this figure, we\nnote that as x approaches 5 from either right or left, the graph of the function\nf(x) = x +10 approaches the point (5, 15).\nWe observe that the value of the function at x = 5 also happens to be equal to 15.\nIllustration 2  Consider the function f(x) = x3. Let us try to find the limit of this\nfunction at x = 1. Proceeding as in the previous case, we tabulate the value of f(x) at\nx near 1. This is given in the Table 12.5.\nTable 12.5\nFrom this table, we deduce that value of f(x) at x = 1 should be greater than\n0.997002999 and le ss than 1.003003001 assuming nothing dramatic happens betweenx 0.9 0.99 0.999 1.001 1.01 1.1\nf(x)0.729 0.970299 0.997002999\n1.003003001 1.030301 1.331x 4.9 4.95 4.99 4.995 5.001 5.01 5.1\nf(x) 14.9 14.95 14.99 14.995 15.001 15.01 15.1\nReprint 2025-26\n\n  LIMITS AND DERIVATIVES            223\nx = 0.999 and 1.001. It is reasonable to assume that the value of the f(x) at x = 1 as\ndictated by the numbers to the left of 1 is 1, i.e.,\n()\n1lim 1\nxf x\n−→=.\nSimilarly , when x approaches 1 from the right, f(x) should  be taking value 1, i.e.,\n()\n1lim 1\nxf x\n+→=.\nHence, it is likely that the left hand limit of f(x) and the right hand limit of f(x) are\nboth equal to 1. Thus,\n() () ()\n1 1 1lim lim lim 1\nx x xf x f x f x\n− +→ → →= = = .\nThis conclusion about the limit being equal to 1 is somewhat strengthened by\nseeing the graph of this function which is given in Fig 2.1 1, Chapter 2. In this figure, we\nnote that as x approaches 1 from either right or left, the graph of the function\nf(x) = x3 approaches the point (1, 1).\nWe observe, again, that the value of the function at x = 1 also happens to be\nequal to 1.\nIllustration 3  Consider the function f(x) =\n 3x. Let us try to find the limit of this\nfunction at x = 2. The following Table 12.6 is now self-explanatory .\nTable 12.6\nx 1.9 1.95 1.99 1.999 2.001 2.01 2.1\nf(x) 5.7 5.85\n5.97 5.997 6.003 6.03 6.3\nAs before we observe that as x  approaches 2\nfrom either left or right, the value of f(x) seem to\napproach 6. We record this as\n() () ()\n2 2 2lim lim lim 6\nx x xf x f x f x\n− +→ → →= = =\nIts graph shown in Fig 12.4 strengthens this\nfact.\nHere again we note that the value of the function\nat x = 2 coincides with the limit at x = 2.\nIllustration 4  Consider the constant function\nf(x) = 3. Let us try to find its limit at x = 2. This\nfunction being the constant function takes the sameFig 12.4\nReprint 2025-26\n\n224 MATHEMA TICS\nvalue (3, in this case) everywhere, i.e., its value at points close to 2 is 3. Hence\n() () ()\n2 2 2lim lim lim 3\nx x xf x f x f x\n+→ → →= = =\nGraph of f(x) = 3 is anyway the line parallel to x-axis passing through (0, 3) and\nis shown in Fig 2.9, Chapter 2. From this also it is clear that the required limit is 3. In\nfact, it is easily observed that () lim 3\nx af x\n→= for any real number a.\nIllustration 5 Consider the function f(x) = x2 + x\n. We want to find ()\n1lim\nxf x\n→. We\ntabulate the values of f(x) near x = \n1 in Table 12.7.\nTable 12.7\nx 0.9 0.99 0.999 1.01 1.1 1.2\nf(x) 1.71 1.9701 1.997001 2.0301 2.31 2.64\nFrom this it is reasonable to deduce that\n() () ()\n1 1 1lim lim lim 2\nx x xf x f x f x\n− +→ → →= = = .\nFrom the graph of f(x) = x2 + x\nshown in the Fig 1 2.5,  it is clear that as x\napproaches 1, the graph approaches (1, 2).\nHere, again we observe that the\n1lim\nx→ f (x) = f (1)\nNow , convince yourself of the\nfollowing three facts:\n2\n1 1 1lim 1, lim 1 and lim 1 2\nx x xx x x\n→ → →= = + =\nThen2 2\n1 1 1lim lim 1 1 2 lim\nx x xx x x x\n→ → →  + = + = = +  .\nAlso ( ) ( )2\n1 1 1 1lim . lim 1 1.2 2 lim 1 lim\nx x x xx x x x x x\n→ → → →    + = = = + = +    .Fig 12.5\nReprint 2025-26\n\n  LIMITS AND DERIVATIVES            225\nIllustration 6  Consider the function f(x) = sin x.

Below we tabulate the values of the function for positive\nx close to 0 (in this table  n denotes any positive integer).\nFrom the Table 12.10 given below , we see that as x tends to 0, f(x) becomes\nlarger and lar ger.

This is not a coincidence. In fact,\nbelow we formalise these as a theorem without proof.\nTheorem 1  Let f  and g be two functions such that both lim\nx a→ f (x) and  lim\nx a→ g(x) exist.\nThen\n  (i) Limit of sum of two functions is sum of the limits of the functions, i.e.,\nlim\nx a→[f(x) + g (x)] =  lim\nx a→ f(x) +  lim\nx a→ g(x).\n (ii) Limit of difference of two functions is difference of the limits of the functions, i.e.,\nlim\nx a→[f(x) – g(x)] =  lim\nx a→ f(x) –  lim\nx a→ g(x).\n(iii) Limit of product of two functions is product of the limits of the functions, i.e.,\nlim\nx a→ [f(x) . g(x)] =  lim\nx a→ f(x).  lim\nx a→ g(x).\n(iv) Limit of quotient of two functions is quotient of the limits of the functions (whenever\nthe denom inator is non zero), i.e.,\n( )\n( )()\n( )lim\nlimlimx a\nx a\nx af xf x\ng x g x→\n→\n→=\nANote In particular as a special case of (iii), when g is the constant function\nsuch that  g(x) = λ, for some real number λ, we have\n()() () lim . .lim\nx a x af x f x\n→ → λ =λ  .\nIn the next two subsections, we illustrate how to exploit this theorem to evaluate\nlimits of special types of functions.\n12.3.2  Limit s of polynomials and rational functions  A function f is said to be a\npolynomial function of degree n f(x) = a0 + a1x + a2x2 +. . . + anxn, where ais are real\nnumbe rs such that an ≠ 0 for some natural number n.\nWe know that lim\nx a→x = a.

This is illustrated in Fig 12.8.\nTheorem 4  (Sandwich Theorem)  Let f, g and h be real functions such that\nf (x) ≤ g( x) ≤ h(x) for all x in the common domain of definition. For some real number\na, if lim\nx a→  f(x) = l = lim\nx a→ h(x), then lim\nx a→ g(x) = l.

Thus\nOA sin x  < OA . x < OA . tan x.\nSince length OA  is positive, we have\nsin x < x < tan \nx.\nSince 0 < x <π\n2, sinx is positive and thus by dividing throughout by sin x, we have\n1<1\nsin cosx\nx x< .

Leibnitz (1646 – 1717).\nBoth of them independently invented calculus around the seventeenth century .\nAfter the advent of calculus many mathematicians contributed for further\ndevelopment of calculus. The rigorous concept is mainly attributed to the great\nReprint 2025-26\n\n256 MATHEMA TICS\nmathematicians, A.L. Cauchy , J.L.Lagrange and Karl Weierstrass. Cauchy gave\nthe foundation of calculus as we have now generally accepted in our textbooks.\nCauchy used D’  Alembert’ s limit concept to define the derivative of a function.\nStarting with definition of a limit, Cauchy gave examples such as the limit of\nsinα\nα for α= 0. He wrote ( ) ( ),y f x i f x\nx i∆ + −=∆ and called the limit for\n0,i→ the “function derive’e, y′ for f ′ (x)”.\nBefore 1900, it was thought that calculus is quite difficult to teach. So calculus\nbecame beyond the reach of youngsters. But just in 1900, John Perry and others\nin England started propagating the view that essential ideas and methods of calculus\nwere simple and could be taught even in schools. F .L. Grif fin, pioneered the\nteaching of calculus to first year students. This was regarded as one of the most\ndaring act in those days.\nToday not only the mathematics but many other subjects such as Physics,\nChemistry , Economics and Biological Sciences are enjoying the fruits of calculus.\n—vvv\nvv—\nReprint 2025-26\n\n",
