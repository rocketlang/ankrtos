A sol ution of 8% boric acid is to be diluted by adding a 2% boric acid solution to\nit. The resulting mixture is to be more than 4% but less than 6% boric acid.

IQ of a person is given by the formula\nIQ =MA\nCA × 100,\nwhere MA is mental age and CA is chronological age. If 80 ≤ IQ ≤ 140 for a group of\n12 years old children, find the range of their mental age.\nSummary\n®Two real numbers or two algebraic expressions related by the symbols <, >, ≤\nor ≥ form an inequality .\n®Equal numbers may be  added to (or subtracted from ) both sides of an inequality .\n®Both sides of an inequality can be  multiplied (or divided ) by the same  positive\nnumber . But when both sides are multiplied (or divided) by a negative number ,\nthen the inequality is reversed.\n®The values of x, which make an inequality a true statement, are called solutions\nof the inequality .\n®To represent x < a (or x > a) on a number line, put a circle on the number a and\ndark line to the left (or right) of the number a.\n®To represent x ≤ a (or x ≥ a) on a number line, put a dark circle on the number\na and dark the line to the left (or right) of the number x.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n",
