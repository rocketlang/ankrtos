The point of rotation is called the vertex . If the direction of\nrotation is anticlockwise, the angle is said to be positive  and if the direction of rotation\nis clockwise, then the angle is negative (Fig 3.1).\nThe measure of an angle is the amount of\nrotation performed to get the terminal side from\nthe initial side. There are several units for\nmeasuring angles. The definition of an angle\nsuggests a unit, viz. one complete r evolution  from the position of the initial side as\nindicated in Fig 3.2.\nThis is often convenient for large angles. For example, we can say that a rapidly\nspinning wheel is making an angle of say 15 revolution per second. We shall  describe\ntwo other units of measurement of an angle which are most commonly used, viz.\ndegree measure and radian measure.\n3.2.1   Degree measure\n  If a rotation from the initial side to terminal side is th1\n360 \n  of\na revolution, the angle is said to have a measure of one degree, written as 1°.  A degree is\ndivided into 60 minutes, and a minute is divided into 60 seconds . One sixtieth of a degree is\ncalled a minute , written as 1 ′, and one sixtieth of a minute is called a second , written as 1 ″.\nThus, 1° = 60 ′, 1′ = 60\n″\nSome of the angles whose measures are 360°,180°, 270°, 420°, – 30°, – 420° are\nshown in Fig 3.3.Fig  3.2\nFig  3.3\nReprint 2025-26\n\nTRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS      45\n3.2.2  Radian measure   There is another unit for measurement of an angle, called\nthe radian measure. Angle subtended at the centre by an arc of length 1 unit in a\nunit circle (circle of radius 1 unit) is said to have a measure of 1 radian. In the Fig\n3.4(i) to (iv), OA is the initial side and OB is the terminal side. The figures show the\nangles whose measures are 1 radian, –1 radian, 11\n2 radian and –11\n2 radian.\n(i) (ii)\n(iii)\nFig  3.4 (i) to (iv)(iv)\nWe know that the circumferen ce of a circle of radius  1 unit is 2 π. Thus, one\ncomplete revolution of the initial side subtends an angle of  2 π radian.\nMore generally , in a circle of radius  r, an arc of length r will subtend an angle of\n1 radian. It is well-known that equal arcs of a circle subtend equal angle at the centre.\nSince in a circle of radius r, an arc of length r subtends an angle whose measure is 1\nradian, an arc of length l will subtend an angle whose measure is l\nr radian. Thus, if in\na circle of radius r, an arc of length l subtends an angle θ radian at the centre, we have\nθ  = l\nr  or  l  = r θ.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n46 MATHEMA TICS\n3.2.3  Relation between radian and real numbers\nConsider the unit circle with centre O. Let A be any point\non the circle. Consider OA as initial side of an angle.\nThen the length  of an arc of the circle will give the radian\nmeasure of the angle which the arc will subtend at the\ncentre of the circle. Consider the line P AQ which is\ntangent to the circle at A. Let the point A represent the\nreal number zero, AP represents positive real number and\nAQ represents negative real numbers (Fig 3.5). If we\nrope the line AP in the anticlockwise direction along the\ncircle, and AQ in the clockwise direction, then every real\nnumber will correspond to a radian measure and\nconversely . Thus, radian measures and real numbers can\nbe considered as one and the same .\n3.2.4 \n  Relation between degree and radian    Since a circle subtends at the centre\nan angle whose radian measure is 2 π and its degree measure is 360 °, it follows that\n2π radian = 360 °  or π radian = 180 °\nThe a bove relation enables us to express a radian measure in terms of degree\nmeasure and a degree  measure in terms of radian measure. Using approximate value\nof π as 22\n7, we have\n1 radian = 180\nπ°= 57° 16′ approximately .\nAlso 1° = π\n180 radian  =  0.01746 radian approximately .\nThe relation between degree measures and radian measure of some common angles\nare given in the following t able:A\nO1P\n12\n−1\n−2\nQ0\nFig  3.5\nDegree 30° 45° 60° 90° 180° 270° 360°\nRadianπ\n6π\n4π\n3π\n2π3π\n22π\nReprint 2025-26\n\nTRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS      47\nNotational Convention\nSince angles are measured either in degrees or in radians, we adopt the convention\nthat whenever we write angle θ°, we mean the angle whose degree measure is θ and\nwhenever we write angle β, we mean the angle whose radian measure is β.\nNote that when an angle is expressed in radians, the word ‘radian’ is frequently\nomitted. Thus, ππ 180 and 454= ° = °  are written with the understanding that π and π\n4\nare radian measures. Thus, we can say that\nRadian measure = π\n180 ×Degree measure\nDegree measure = 180\nπ×Radian measure\nExample 1   Convert  40° 20 ′  into radian measure.\nSolution   We know that 180° =  π radian.\nHence 40° 20′  = 4 0 1\n3 degree =  π\n180×121\n3 radian = 121π\n540 radian.\nTherefore 40° 20′ = 121π\n540  radian.\nExample 2   Convert 6 radians into degree measure.\nSolution\n   We know that  π radian = 180°.\nHence     6 radians =  180\nπ×6 degree = 1080 7\n22×\ndegree\n= 3437\n11degree = 343° + 760\n11×\n minute [as 1 °  = 60 ′]\n= 343° + 38 ′  + 2\n11 minute [as 1 ′ = 60 ″]\n= 343° + 38 ′ + 10.9 ″ = 343°38′  11″ approximately .\nHence      6 radians = 343° 38 ′ 11″ approximately .\nExample 3    Find the radius of the circle in which a central angle of 60° intercepts an\narc of  length 37.4 cm  (use 22π7= ).\nReprint 2025-26\n\n48 MATHEMA TICS\nSolution   Here l = 37.4 cm and θ = 60° = 60π πradian =180 3\nHence, by r =θl, we have\nr =37.4×3 37.4×3×7=π 22 = 35.7 cm\nExample 4    The minute hand of a watch is 1.5 cm long. How far does its tip move in\n40 minutes? (Use π = 3.14).\nSolution   In 60 minutes, the minute hand of a watch completes one revolution. Therefore,\nin 40 minutes, the minute hand turns through 2\n3 of a revolution. Therefore,  2θ = × 360°3\nor 4π\n3 radian. Hence, the required distance travelled is given by\n l =r θ  =  1.5  ×4π\n3cm = 2 π cm = 2 ×3.14 cm = 6.28 cm.\nExample 5   If the arcs of the same lengths in two circles subtend angles 65°and 1 10°\nat the centre, find the ratio of their radii.\nSolution   Let r1 and r2 be the radii of the two circles. Given that\nθ1 = 65° = π65180×  = 13π\n36 radian\nand θ2  = 110° = π110180×  = 22π\n36radian\nLet l be the length of each of the arc. Then l =  r1θ1 =  r2θ2, which gives\n13π\n36 ×r1 = 22π\n36 ×r2 ,  i.e., 1\n2r\nr= 22\n13\nHence  r1 : r2 = 22 : 13.\nEXERCISE 3.1\n1.

We   have learnt in\nprevious classes that in the first quadrant (0 < x < π\n2) a and b are both positive, in the\nsecond quadrant (π\n2 < x <π) a is negative and b is positive, in the third quadrant\n(π < x < 3π\n2) a and b are both negative and in the fourth quadrant (3π\n2 < x < 2π) a is\npositive and b is negative. Therefore, sin x is positive for 0 < x < π, and negative for\nπ < x < 2π. Similarly , cos x is positive for 0 < x < π\n2, negative for π\n2 <  x < 3π\n2 and also\npositive for 3π\n2<  x < 2π. Likewise, we can find the signs of other trigonometric\nfunctions in different quadrants. In fact, we have the following table.\nI II III IV\nsin x + +  –  –\ncos x +  –  –  +\ntan x +  –  +  –\ncosec x + +  –  –\nsec x +  –  –  +\ncot x +  –  +  –\n3.3.2\n  Domain and range of trigonometric functions  From the definition of sine\nand cosine functions, we observe that they are defined for all real numbers. Further ,\nwe observe that for each real number x,\n – 1 ≤ sin x ≤ 1 and  – 1 ≤ cos x ≤ 1\nThus, domain of y = sin x and y = cos x is the set of all real numbers and range\nis the interval [–1, 1], i.e., – 1 ≤ y ≤ 1.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nTRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS      53\nSince cosec x = 1\nsinx, the domain of y = cosec x is the set { x : x ∈ R and\nx ≠ n π, n ∈ Z} and range is the set { y : y ∈ R, y  ≥ 1 or y  ≤ – 1}. Similarly , the domain\nof y = sec x is the set { x : x ∈ R and x  ≠ (2n + 1) π\n2, n ∈ Z} and range is the set\n{y : y  ∈ R, y  ≤ – 1or y ≥ 1}. The domain of y = tan \nx is the set { x : x ∈ R and\nx ≠ (2n + 1) π\n2, n ∈ Z} and range is the set of all real numbers. The domain of\ny = cot x is the set { x : x  ∈ R and x ≠ n π, n ∈ Z} and the range is the set of all real\nnumbers.\nWe further observe that in the first quadrant, as x increases from 0 to π\n2, sin x\nincreases from 0 to 1, as x increases from π\n2 to π, sin x decreases from 1 to 0. In the\nthird quadrant, as x increases from π to3π\n2, sin x decreases from 0 to –1and finally , in\nthe fourth quadrant, sin x increases from –1 to 0 as x increases from 3π\n2 to 2 π.\nSimilarly , we can discuss the behaviour of other trigonometric functions. In fact, we\nhave the following table:\nRemar k In the above table, the statement tan x increases from 0 to ∞ (infinity) for\n0 < x < π\n2 simply means that tan x increases as x increases for 0 < x < π\n2 andI quadrant II quadrant III quadrant IV quadrant\nsin increases from 0 to 1 decreases from 1 to 0 decreases from 0 to –1 increases from –1 to 0\ncos decreases from 1 to 0 decreases from 0 to – 1 increases from –1 to 0 increases from 0 to 1\ntan increases from 0 to ∞increases from – ∞to 0 increases from 0 to ∞increases from – ∞to 0\ncot decreases from ∞ to 0 decreases from 0 to– ∞decreases from ∞ to \n0decreases from 0to – ∞\nsec increases from 1 to ∞increases from – ∞to–1 decreases from – 1to–∞decreases from ∞ to 1\ncosec decreases from ∞ to 1 increases from 1 to ∞increases from – ∞to–1 decreases from–1to–∞\nReprint 2025-26\n\n54 MATHEMA TICS\nFig 3.10 Fig 3.1 1Fig 3.8\nFig 3.9assumes arbitraily lar ge positive values as x approaches to π\n2.  Similarly , to say that\ncosec x decreases from –1 to – ∞ (minus infinity) in the fourth quadrant means that\ncosec x decreases for x ∈ (3π\n2, 2π) and assumes arbitrarily large negative values as\nx approaches to 2 π. The symbols ∞ and  – ∞ simply specify certain types of behaviour\nof functions and variable s.\nWe have already seen that values of sin x and cos x repeats after an interval of\n2π. Hence, values of cosec  x and sec x will also repeat after an interval of 2 π. W\ne\nReprint 2025-26\n\nTRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS      55\nshall see in the next section that tan ( π + x) = tan x. Hence, values of tan x will repeat\nafter an interval of π. Since cot x is reciprocal of tan x, its values will also repeat after\nan interval of π. Using this knowledge and behaviour of trigonometic functions, we can\nsketch the graph of these functions. The graph of these functions are given above:\nExample 6   If cos x =  –  3\n5, x lies in the third quadrant, find the values of other five\ntrigonometric functions.\nSolution   Since cos \nx  = 3\n5− , we have  sec x = 5\n3−\nNow sin2 x + cos2 x = 1, i.e., sin2 x = 1 – cos2 x\nor sin2 x = 1 – 9\n25  = 16\n25\nHence sin x = ± 4\n5\nSince x lies in third quadrant, sin x is negative.

Let x be the angle P4OP1and  y be\nthe angle P1OP2. Then ( x + y) is the angle P4OP2. Also let (–  y) be the angle P4OP3.\nTherefore, P1, P2, P3 and P4 will have the coordinates P1(cos x, sin x),\nP2 [cos ( x + y), sin ( x + y)], P3 [cos (–  y), sin (–  y)] and P4 (1, 0) (Fig 3.14).\nConsider the triangles P1OP3 and P2OP4.

The ancient Indian\nMathematicians, Aryabhatta (476), Brahmagupta (598), Bhaskara I (600) and\nBhaskara II (1 114) got important results. All this knowledge first went from\nIndia to middle-east and from there to Europe. The Greeks had also started the\nstudy of trigonometry but their approach was so clumsy that when the Indian\napproach became known, it was immediately adopted throughout the world.\nIn India, the predecessor of the modern trigonometric functions, known as\nthe sine of an angle, and the introduction of the sine function represents the main\ncontribution of the siddhantas (Sanskrit astronomical works) to the history of\nmathematics.\nBhaskara I (about 600) gave formulae to find the values of sine functions\nfor angles more than 90 °. A sixteenth century Malayalam work Yuktibhasa\n(period) contains a proof for the expansion of sin (A + B). Exact expression for\nsines or cosines of 18 °, 36 °, 54 °, 72 °, etc., are given by\nBhaskara II.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nTRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS      75\n—vvvvv—The symbols sin–1 x, cos–1 x, etc., for arc sin x, arc cos x, etc., were\nsuggested by the astronomer Sir John F .W. Hersehel (1813) The names of Thales\n(about 600 B.C.) is invariably associated with height and distance problems. He\nis credited with the determination of the height of a great pyramid in Egypt by\nmeasuring shadows of the pyramid and an auxiliary staff (or gnomon) of known\nheight, and comparing the ratios:\nH\nSh\ns= = tan (sun’ s altitude)\nThales is also said to have calculated the distance of a ship at sea through\nthe proportionality of sides of similar triangles. Problems on height and distance\nusing the similarity property are also found in ancient Indian works.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n",
