As\nin the case of natural numbers, unless\nit is specially required, we do not show\n1 as a separate factor of any term.We know that 30 can also be written as\n30 = 1 × 30\nThus, 1 and 30 are also factors of 30.\nYou will notice that 1 is a factor of any\nnumber .  For example, 101 = 1 × 101.\nHowever , when we write a number as a\nproduct of factors, we shall not write 1 as\na factor , unless it is specially required.\nReprint 2024-25\n\n146  MATHEMA TICS\nNext consider the expression 3x  (x + 2).  It can be written as a product of factors.\n3, x and ( x + 2)\n3x(x + 2) = ( )2 3+ × ×x x\nThe factors 3, x and ( x +2) are irreducible factors of 3 x (x + 2).\nSimilarly , the expression 10 x (x + 2) ( y + 3) is expressed in its irreducible factor form\nas  10 x (x + 2) ( y + 3) = ( )( ) 2 5 2 3 x x y × × × + × + .\n12.2  What is Factorisation?\nWhen we factorise an algebraic expression, we write it as a product of factors.  These\nfactors may be numbers, algebraic variables or algebraic expressions.\nExpressions like 3 xy, y x25 , 2x (y  + 2), 5 ( y + 1) ( x + 2) are already in factor form.\nTheir factors can be just read of f from them, as we already know .\nOn the other hand consider expressions like 2x + 4, 3 x + 3y , x2 + 5x, x2 + 5x  + 6.\nIt is not obvious what their factors are. We need to develop systematic methods to factorise\nthese expressions, i.e., to find their factors. This is what we shall do now .\n12.2.1  Method of common factors\n•We begin with a simple example: Factorise 2 x + 4.\nWe shall write each term as a product of irreducible factors;\n2x =2 × x\n4 =2 × 2\nHence 2x + 4 =(2 × x) + (2 × 2)\nNotice that factor 2 is common to both the terms.\nObserve, by distributive law\n2 × (x  + 2) = (2 × x) + (2 × 2)\nTherefore, we can write\n2x + 4 = 2 × (x  + 2) = 2 ( x + 2)\nThus, the expression 2 x + 4 is the same as 2 ( x + 2).  Now we can read off its factors:\nthey are 2 and ( x + 2). These factors are irreducible.\nNext, factorise 5xy  + 10 x.\nThe irreducible factor forms of 5 xy and 10 x are respectively ,\n5xy =5 × x × y\n10x =2 × 5  × x\nObserve that the two terms have 5 and x as common factors.  Now ,\n5xy + 10 x =(5 × x × y )  + (5 × x × 2)\n=(5x × y )  + (5x × 2)\nWe combine the two terms using the distributive law ,\n(5x× y)  + (5x× 2) = 5x × ( y + 2)\nTherefore, 5 xy + 10x = 5 x (y + 2). (This is the desired factor form.)\nReprint 2024-25\n\nFACTORISATION   147\nTRY THESEExample 1: Factorise  12 a2b + 15 ab2\nSolution:  \nWe have 12a2b =2 × 2 × 3 × a × a × b\n15ab2 =3 × 5 × a × b × b\nThe two terms have 3, a and b as common factors.\nTherefore, 12a2b + 15 ab2 =(3 × a × b × 2 × 2  × a) + (3 × a × b × 5 × b )\n=3 × a × b × [(2 × 2 × a) + (5 × b)]\n =3ab × (4 a + 5 b)\n= 3ab (4a + 5b\n) (required factor form)\nExample 2:  Factorise 10x2 – 18 x3 + 14x4\nSolution: 10x2 =2 × 5 × x  × x\n        18x3  =2 × 3 × 3 × x × x × x\n       14 x4 =2 × 7 × x  × x × x × x\nThe common factors of the three terms are 2, x and x.\nTherefore, 10x2 – 18 x3 + 14 x4 =(2 × x × x × 5) – (2 × x  × x × 3 × 3 ×  x)\n+ (2 × x × x × 7 × x × x)\n=2 × x × x ×[(5 – (3 × 3 × x) + (7 × x × x)]\n=2x2  ×  (5 – 9x + 7x2) = 2 22 (7 9 5)x x x − +         \nFactorise: (i)  12 x + 36 (ii)  22y  – 33 z(iii)  14 pq + 35 pqr\n12.2.2  Factorisation by regrouping terms\nLook at the expression 2 xy + 2y + 3x\n + 3.  You will notice that the first two terms have\ncommon factors 2 and y and the last two terms have a common factor 3.  But there is no\nsingle factor common to all the terms.  How shall we proceed?\nLet us write (2 xy + 2y) in the factor form:\n2xy + 2y =(2 × x × y) + (2 × y)\n=(2 × y × x) + (2 × y  × 1)\n=(2y × x) + (2y  × 1) = 2y  (x + 1)\nSimilarly ,      3x + 3 = (3 × x) + (3 × 1)\n=3 × (x  + 1) = 3 ( x  + 1)\nHence, 2xy + 2y + 3x + 3 = 2y (x + 1) + 3 (x  +1)\nObserve, now we have a common factor ( x + 1) in both the terms on the right hand\nside. Combining the two terms,\n2xy + 2y + 3x + 3 = 2 y (x + 1) + 3 ( x + 1) = ( x + 1) (2 y + 3)\nThe expression 2xy  + 2y + 3x + 3 is now in the form of a product of factors. Its\nfactors are ( x + 1) and (2 y + 3). Note, these factors are irreducible.Note, we need to\nshow1 as a factor\nhere. Why?Do you notice that the factor\nform of an expression has only\none term?(combining the three terms)(combining the terms)\nReprint 2024-25\n\n148  MATHEMA TICS\nWhat is regrouping?\nSuppose, the above expression was given as 2 xy + 3 + 2 y + 3x; then it will not be easy to\nsee the factorisation. Rearranging the expression, as 2 xy + 2y + 3x + 3, allows us to form\ngroups (2 xy + 2y) and (3 x + 3) leading to factorisation. This is regrouping.\nRegrouping may be possible in more than one ways. Suppose, we regroup the\nexpression as:  2xy + 3x + 2y + 3. This will also lead to factors. Let us try:\n2xy + 3x + 2y + 3 = 2 × x × y + 3 × x + 2 × y + 3\n=x × (2y + 3) + 1 × (2 y + 3)\n           = (2y + 3) (\nx + 1)\nThe factors are the same (as they have to be), although they appear in dif ferent order .\nExample 3:  Factorise  6 xy – 4y + 6 – 9 x.\nSolution:\nStep 1 Check if there is a common factor among all terms.  There is none.\nStep 2 Think of grouping.  Notice that first two terms have a common factor 2 y;\n6xy – 4y =2y (3x – 2) (a)\nWhat about the last two terms? Observe them.  If you change their order to\n– 9x + 6, the factor ( 3x – 2) will come out;\n–9x + 6 = –3 (3x ) + 3 (2)\n=– 3 (3 x – 2) (b)\nStep 3 Putting (a) and (b) together ,\n6xy – 4y + 6 – 9 x =6xy – 4y – 9x + 6\n= 2y (3x – 2) – 3 (3 x – 2)\n=(3x – 2) (2 y – 3)\nThe factors of (6 xy – 4y + 6 – 9\n x) are (3 x – 2) and (2 y – 3).\nEXERCISE 12.1\n1.Find the common factors of the given terms.\n(i)12x, 36 (ii)2y, 22xy (iii) 14 pq, 28p2q2\n(iv) 2x, 3x2, 4 (v)6 abc, 24ab2, 12 a2b\n(vi) 16 x3, – 4x2, 32x (vii) 10 pq, 20 qr, 30rp\n(viii) 3x2 y3, 10x3 y2,6 x2 y2z\n2.Factorise the  following expressions.\n(i)7x – 42 (ii)6p – 12q (iii) 7a2 + 14 a\n(iv) – 16 z + 20 z3(v)20 l2 m + 30 a l m\n(vi) 5 x2 y – 15 xy2(vii) 10 a2 – 15  b2 + 20 c2\n(viii) – 4 a2 + 4 ab – 4 ca (ix) x2 y z +  x y2z + x y z2\n(x)a x2 y + b x y2 + c x y z\n3.Factorise.\n(i)x2 +  x y + 8x + 8y (ii)15 xy  – 6x + 5y – 2\nReprint 2024-25\n\nFACTORISATION   149\n(iii) ax + bx – ay – by (iv) 15 pq  + 15 + 9 q + 25 p\n(v)z – 7 + 7 x y – x y z\n12.2.3  Factorisation using identities\nWe know that (a + b )2  =a2 + 2ab + b2(I)\n(a – b )2  =a2 – 2ab\n + b2(II)\n(a + b) ( a – b)  = a2 – b2(III)\nThe following solved examples illustrate how to use these identities for factorisation. What\nwe do is to observe the given expression. If it has a form that fits the right hand side of one\nof the identities, then the expression corresponding to the left hand side of the identity\ngives the desired factorisation.\nExample 4:  Factorise x2 + 8x + 16\nSolution:  Observe the expression; it has three terms. Therefore, it does not fit\nIdentity III. Also, it’ s first and third terms are perfect squares with a positive sign before\nthe middle term. So, it is of the form a2 + 2ab + b2 where  a = x and b = 4\nsuch that a2 + 2ab + b2 = x2 + 2 ( x) (4) + 42\n=x2 + 8x + 16\nSince a2 + 2ab + b2 =(a + b)2,\nby comparison x2 + 8x + 16 = ( x + 4)2    (the required factorisation)\nExample 5:  Factorise 4 y2 – 12y + 9\nSolution:  Observe 4 y2 = (2 y)2, 9 = 32 and 12 y = 2 × 3 × (2y )\nTherefore, 4y2 – 12y + 9 = (2y)2 – 2 × 3 × (2y ) + (3)2\n=( 2y – 3)2(required factorisation)\nExample 6:  Factorise  49p2 – 36\nSolution:  There are two terms; both are squares and the second is negative. The\nexpression is of the form ( a2 – b2). Identity III is applicable here;\n   49p2  – 36 = (7p)2 – ( 6 )2\n=(7p – 6 ) ( 7 p + 6) (required factorisation)\nExample 7:  Factorise a2 – 2ab + b2 – c2\nSolution:  The first three terms of the given expression form ( a – b)2.  The fourth term\nis a square.  So the expression can be reduced to a difference of two squares.\nThus, a2 – 2ab + b2 – c2 =(a – b )2– c2(Applying Identity II)\n      = [(a – b) – c) ((a – b) + c)] (Applying Identity III)\n= (a – b – c) (a – b\n + c) (required factorisation)\nNotice, how we applied two identities one after the other to obtain the required factorisation.\nExample 8:  Factorise   m4 – 256\nSolution:  We note m4 = (m2)2 and 256 = (16) 2Observe here the given\nexpression is of the form\na2 – 2ab + b2.\nWhere a = 2y, and b = 3\nwith 2 ab = 2 × 2 y × 3 = 12 y.\nReprint 2024-25\n\n150  MATHEMA TICS\nThus, the given expression fits Identity III.\nTherefore, m4 – 256 = (m2)2 – (16) 2\n=\n(m2 –16) (m2 +16) [(using Identity (III)]\nNow, (m2 + 16) cannot be factorised further , but ( m2 –16) is factorisable again as per\nIdentity III.\nm2–16 = m2 – 42\n= (m – 4) ( m + 4)\nTherefore, m4 – 256 = (m – 4) ( m + 4)  ( m2 +16)\n12.2.4  Factors of  the form ( x xx xx + aaa aa) ( x xx xx + b bb bb)\nLet us now discuss how we can factorise expressions in one variable, like x2 + 5x + 6,\n y2 – 7y + 12,  z2 – 4z – 12, 3 m2 + 9m + 6, etc. Observe that these expressions are not\nof  the type (a + b ) 2 or (a – b ) 2, i.e., they are not perfect squares. For example, in\nx2 + 5x + 6, the term 6 is not a perfect square.  These expressions obviously also do not\nfit the type ( a2 – b2) either .\nThey , however , seem to be of the type x2 + (a + b ) x + a b. We may therefore, try to\nuse Identity IV studied in the last chapter to factorise these expressions:\n(x + a ) (x + b ) =x2 + (a + b ) x + ab (IV)\nFor that we have to look at the coefficients of x and the constant term. Let us see how\nit is done in the following example.\nExample 9:  Factorise x2 + 5x + 6\nSolution:   If we compare the R.H.S. of Identity (IV) with x2 + 5x + 6, we find ab = 6,\nand a + b = 5. From this, we must obtain a and b. The factors then will be\n(x + a) and ( x + b).\nIf  a b  = 6, it means that a and b are factors of 6.  Let us try  a = 6, b  = 1. For these\nvalues  a + b = 7, and not 5, So this choice is not right.\nLet us try  a = 2, b = 3.  For this a + b = 5 exactly as required.\nThe factorised form of this given expression is then  ( x +2) ( x + 3).\nIn general, for factorising an algebraic expression of the type x2 + px + q, we find two\nfactors a and b of q (i.e., the constant term) such that\nab = q    and     a + b = p\nThen, the expression becomes x2 + (a + b) x + ab\nor x2 + ax + bx + ab\nor x(x + a) + b(x + a)\nor (x + a) (x + b)        which are the required factors.\nExample 10:  Find the factors of y2 –7y +12.\nSolution:   We note 12 = 3 × 4 and 3 + 4 = 7.  Therefore,\n      y2 – 7y+ 12 = y2 – 3y – 4y + 12\n                          = y (y –3) – 4 (y  –3)  = (y –3) ( y – 4)\nReprint 2024-25\n\nFACTORISATION   151\nNote, this time we did not compare the expression with that in Identity (IV) to identify\na and b .  After suf ficient practice you may not need to compare the given expressions for\ntheir factorisation with the expressions in the identities; instead you can proceed directly\nas we did above.\nExample 11:  Obtain the factors of z2 – 4z – 12.\nSolution:  Here a b = –12 ; this means one of a  and b is negative. Further , a + b  = – 4,\nthis means the one with lar ger numerical value is negative. We try a = – 4, \nb = 3; but\nthis will not work, since a + b = –1.  Next possible values are a = – 6, b = 2, so that\na + b = – 4 as required.\nHence, z2  – 4z –12 = z2  – 6z + 2 z –12\n=z(z – 6) + 2(z – 6 )\n= (z – 6) ( z + 2)\nExample 12:  Find the factors of 3 m2 + 9m +  6.\nSolution:  We notice that 3 is a common factor of all the terms.\nTherefore, 3m2 + 9m + 6 = 3(m2 + 3m + 2)\nNow , m 2 + 3m + 2 = m2 + m + 2m + 2 (as 2 = 1 × 2)\n=m(m + 1)+ 2( \nm + 1)\n                  = (m + 1) ( m + 2)\nTherefore, 3m2 + 9m + 6 = 3(m + 1) ( m + 2)\nEXERCISE 12.2\n1.Factorise the following expressions.\n(i)a2 + 8a + 16 (ii)p2 – 10 p + 25 (iii) 25m2 + 30m  + 9\n(iv) 49y2 + 84 yz + 36 z2(v)4x2 – 8x + 4\n(vi) 121b2 – 88 bc + 16 c2\n(vii) (l + m)2 – 4lm        (Hint: Expand ( l + m)2 first)\n(viii) a4 + 2a2b2 + b4\n2.Factorise.\n(i)4p2 – 9q2(ii)63a2 – 112b2(iii) 49x2 – 36\n(iv) 16x5 – 144 x3(v)(l + m)2 – (l – m)2\n(vi) 9x2 y2 – 16 (vii) (x2 – 2xy + y2) – z2\n(viii) 25a2 – 4b2 + 28bc  – 49 c2\n3.Factorise the expressions.\n(i)ax2 + bx (ii)7p2 + 21 q2(iii) 2x3 + 2xy2  + 2 xz2\n(iv) am2 + bm2 + bn2 + an2(v)(lm + l) +  m + 1\n(vi) y (y + z) + 9 (y + z) (vii) 5y2 – 20 y – 8z + 2yz\n(viii) 10ab + 4 a  + 5b  + 2 (ix) 6xy – 4y + 6 – 9 x\nReprint 2024-25\n\n152  MATHEMA TICS\n4.Factorise.\n(i)a4 – b4(ii)p4 – 81 (iii) x4 – (y + z)4\n(iv) x4 – (x – z)4(v)a4 – 2a2b2 + b4\n5.Factorise the following expressions.\n(i)p2 + 6p\n + 8 (ii)q2 – 10 q + 21 (iii) p2 + 6p – 16\n12.3  Division of Algebraic Expressions\nWe have learnt how to add and subtract algebraic expressions. We also know how to\nmultiply two expressions. We have not however , looked at division of one algebraic\nexpression by another . This is what we wish to do in this section.\nWe recall that division is the inverse operation of multiplication. Thus, 7 × 8 = 56 gives\n56 ÷ 8 = 7 or 56 ÷  7 = 8.\nWe may similarly follow the division of algebraic expressions. For example,\n(i) 2x × 3x2 =6x3\nTherefore, 6x3 ÷ 2x =3x2\nand also, 6x3 ÷ 3x2 =2x.\n(ii) 5x (x + 4) = 5x2 + 20 x\nTherefore, (5x2 + 20 x) ÷ 5x =x + 4\nand also (5x2 + 20 x) ÷ (x + 4) = 5x.\nWe shall now look closely at how the division of one expression by another can be\ncarried out.

These factors may be\nnumbers, algebraic variables or algebraic expressions.\n2.An irreducible factor is a factor which cannot be expressed further as a product of factors.\n3.A systematic way of factorising an expression is the common factor method. It consists of\nthree steps: (i) Write each term of the expression as a product of irreducible factors (ii) Look\nfor and separate the common factors and (iii) Combine the remaining factors in each term in\naccordance with the distributive law .\n4.Sometimes, all the terms in a given expression do not have a common factor; but the terms can\nbe grouped in such a way that all the terms in each group have a common factor . When we do\nthis, there emerges a common factor across all the groups leading to the required factorisation\nof the expression. This is the method of regrouping.\n5.In factorisation by regrouping, we should remember that any regrouping (i.e., rearrangement)\nof the terms in the given expression may not lead to factorisation. We must observe the\nexpression and come out with the desired regrouping by trial and error .\nReprint 2024-25\n\n156  MATHEMA TICS\n6.A number of expressions to be factorised are of the form or can be put into the form : a2 + 2 ab + b2,\na2 – 2ab + b2, a2 – b2 and x2 + (a + b\n) + ab. These expressions can be easily factorised using\nIdentities I, II, III and IV .\na2 + 2 ab + b2 =(a + b)2\na2 – 2ab + b2 =(a – b)2\na2 – b2 =(a + b) (a – b)\nx2 + (a + b) x + ab = (x + a) (x + b)\n7.In expressions which have factors of the type ( x + a) (x + b), remember the numerical term gives ab. Its\nfactors, a and b, should be so chosen that their sum, with signs taken care of, is the coefficient of x.\n8.We know that in the case of numbers, division is the inverse of multiplication. This idea is applicable\nalso to the division of algebraic expressions.\n9.In the case of division of a polynomial by a monomial, we may carry out the division either by\ndividing each term of the polynomial by the monomial or by the common factor method.\n10. In the case of division of a polynomial by a polynomial, we cannot proceed by dividing each term\nin the dividend polynomial by the divisor polynomial. Instead, we factorise both the polynomials\nand cancel their common factors.\n11.In the case of divisions of algebraic expressions that we studied in this chapter , we have\nDividend = Divisor × Quotient.\nIn general, however , the relation is\nDividend = Divisor × Quotient + Remainder\nThus, we have considered in the present chapter only those divisions in which the remainder\nis zero.\nReprint 2024-25\n\n",
