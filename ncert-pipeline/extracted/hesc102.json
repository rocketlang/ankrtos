Y ou know that br ead left\nunused under moist conditions is\nattacked by fungus. Microorganisms\nspoil our food. Spoiled food emits bad\nsmell and has a bad taste and changed\ncolour . Is spoiling of food a chemical\nreaction?\nPaheli bought some mangoes but she\ncould not eat them for a few days. Later\nshe found that they were spoilt and\nrotten. But she knows that the mango\npickle her grandmother makes does not\nspoil for a long time.

Microorganisms\nthat grow on our food sometimes\nproduce toxic substances. These\n2024-25\n\nSCIENCE 26Let us study the common methods\nof pr eserving food in our homes. W e\nhave to save it from the attack of\nmicroorganisms.\nChemical Method\nSalts and edible oils are the common\nchemicals generally used to check the\ngrowth of microorganisms. Therefore\nthey ar e called preservatives . We add\nsalt or acid preservatives to pickles to\nprevent the attack of microbes. Sodium\nbenzoate and sodium metabisulphite are\ncommon preservatives. These are also\nused in jams and squashes to check\ntheir spoilage .\nPreservation by Common Salt\nCommon salt has been used to preserve\nmeat and fish for ages. Meat and fish\nare covered with dry salt to check\nthe growth of bacteria. Salting is also\nused to preserve amla\n, raw mangoes,\ntamarind, etc.\nPreservation by Sugar\nJams, jellies and squashes are preserved\nby sugar . Sugar r educes the moistur e\ncontent which inhibits the growth of\nbacteria which spoil food.\nPreservation by Oil and Vinegar\nUse of oil and vinegar prevents spoilage\nof pickles because bacteria cannot live\nin such an envir onment. V egetables,\nfruits, fish and meat are often preserved\nby this method.\nHeat and Cold Treatments\nYou must have observed your mother\nboiling milk before it is stored or used.\nBoiling kills many microorganisms.Similarly, we keep our food in the\nrefrigerator . Low temperatur e inhibits\nthe growth of microbes.\nPasteurised milk can be consumed\nwithout boiling as it is free from harmful\nmicrobes. The milk is heated to about\n700C for 15 to 30 seconds and then\nsuddenly chilled and stored. By doing\nso, it prevents the growth of microbes.\nThis process was discovered by Louis\nPasteur . It is called pasteurisation .\nStorage and Packing\nThese days dry fruits and even\nvegetables are sold in sealed air tight\npackets to prevent the attack of\nmicrobes.\n2.6Nitrogen Fixation\nYou have lear nt about the bacterium\nRhizobium   in Classes VI and VII. It is\ninvolved in the  fixation of nitrogen in\nleguminous plants (pulses). Recall that\nRhizobium  lives in the root nodules of\nleguminous plants  (Fig. 2.9), such as\nbeans and peas, with which it has a\nsymbiotic relationship. Sometimes\nnitrogen gets fixed through the action\nof lightning. But you know that the\namount of nitrogen in the atmosphere\nremains constant. Y ou may wonder\nhow? Let us understand this in the next\nsection.\nWhy does the milk that\ncomes in packets not spoil?\nMy mother told me that the\nmilk is ‘pasteurised’. What\nis pasteurisation?\n2024-25\n\nMICROORGANISMS  : FRIEND AND FOE 27nitrogen cannot be taken directly by\nplants and animals. Certain bacteria and\nblue green algae  present in the soil fix\nnitrogen from the atmosphere and\nconvert it into compounds of nitrogen.\nOnce nitrogen is converted into these\nusable compounds, it can be utilised by\nplants from the soil through their root\nsystem. Nitrogen is then used for the\nsynthesis of plant proteins and other\ncompounds. Animals feeding on plants\nget these proteins and other nitrogen\ncompounds (Fig. 2.10).\nWhen plants and animals die,\nbacteria and fungi present in the soil\nconvert the nitrogenous wastes into\nnitrogenous compounds to be used by\nplants again. Certain other bacteria\nconvert some part of them to nitrogen\ngas which goes back into the\natmosphere. As a result, the percentage\nof nitrogen in the atmosphere remains\nmore or less constant.\nFig. 2.10  : Nitrogen cycle\nFig. 2.9 : Roots of a leguminous plant with root\nnodules\n2.7 Nitrogen cycle\nOur atmosphere has 78% nitrogen gas.\nNitrogen is one of the essential\nconstituents of all living organisms as\npart of proteins, chlorophyll, nucleic\nacids and vitamins.
