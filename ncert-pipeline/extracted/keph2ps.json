Eminent physicist r P Feynmann wanted the following message left for future \nbeings, if any.\n“Matter is made up of atoms”\na lady student and teacher of literature, wanted the following message left:\n“Water existed, so human beings could happen”.\nanother person thought it should be: “Idea of wheel for motion”\nWrite down what message each one of you would like to leave for futur\ne generations. then \ndiscuss it in your group and add or modify, if you want to change your mind. Give it to your \nteacher and join in any discussion that follows.\n",

      "title": "Reductionism",
      "content": "2. Reductionism\nKinetic theory of Gases relates the Big to the Small, the Macro to the Micr\no. a gas as a system \nis related to its components, \nthe molecules. this way of describing a system as a result of the \nproperties \nof its components is usually called Reductionism. It explains the behaviour of the \ngroup by the simpler and predictable behaviour of individuals. Macroscopic observations and \nmicroscopic properties have a mutual interdependence in this approach. Is this method useful?\nthis way of \nunderstanding has its limitations outside physics and chemistry, may be even in \nthese subjects. a painting cannot be discussed as a collection of the pr\noperties of chemicals used \nin making the canvas and the painting. What emerges is more than the sum of its components.\nQuestion: Can you think of other areas where such an approach is used?\n          Describe briefly a system which is fully describable in terms of its components.  Describe \none which is not. Discuss with other members of the group and write your views. Give it to your teacher and join in any discussion that may follow.\n",

      "content": "3.\n Molecular approach to heat\nDescribe what you think will happen in the following case. an enclosure is separated by a porous \nwall into two parts. One is filled with nitr\nogen gas (N2) and the other with CO2. Gases will diffuse \nfrom one side to the other.\nQuestion 1:  Will both gases diffuse to the same extent? If not, which will diffuse more. Give reasons.\nQuestion 2: Will the pressure and temperature be unchanged? If not, what will be the changes \nin both. Give reasons.\n Write down your answers. Discuss with the group and modify them or add comments. \nGive to the teacher and join in the discussion.\n Students and teachers will find that such seminars and discussions lead to tremendous \nunderstanding, not only of physics, but also of science and social sciences. they also bring in \nsome maturity among students.\nPrelims.indd   13 1/2/2023   10:32:35\nReprint 2025-26\n\ncontents  oF Physics  Part i\nCHAPTER  1\nUnits and measUrements  1\nCHAPTER  2\nmotion in a straight  line 13\nCHAPTER  3\nmotion in a Plane 37\n",
