Let\nE be the event ‘at least two heads appear ’ and  F be the event ‘first coin shows tail’.\nThen\nE ={HHH, HHT , HTH, THH}\nand F ={THH, THT, TTH, TTT}\nTherefore P(E) = P ({HHH}) + P ({HHT}) + P ({HTH}) + P ({THH})\n=1 1 1 1 1\n8 8 8 8 2+ + + =  (Why ?)\nand P(F) = P ({THH}) + P ({THT}) + P ({TTH}) + P ({TTT})\n=1 1 1 1 1\n8 8 8 8 2+ + + =\nAlso E ∩ F ={THH}\nwith P(E ∩ F) = P({THH}) = 1\n8\nNow , suppose we are given that the first coin shows tail, i.e. F occurs, then what is\nthe probability of occurrence of E? With the information of occurrence of F , we are\nsure that the cases in which first coin does not result into a tail should not be considered\nwhile finding the probability of E. This information reduces our sample space from the\nset S to its subset F for the event E. In other words, the additional information really\namounts to telling us that the situation may be considered as being that of a new\nrandom experiment for which the sample space consists of all those outcomes only\nwhich are favourable to the occurrence of the event F .\nNow , the sample point of F which is favourable to event E is THH.\nThus, Probability of E considering F as the sample space = 1\n4,\nor Probability of E given that the event F has occurred = 1\n4\nThis probability of the event E is called the conditional pr obability of E given\nthat F has alr eady occur red, and is denoted by P  (E|F).\nThus P(E|F) =1\n4\nNote that the elements of F which favour the event E are the common elements of\nE and F , i.e. the sample points of E ∩ F.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n 408 MATHEMA TICS\nThus, we can also write the conditional probability of E given that F has occurred as\nP(E|F) =Numberof elementaryeventsfavourableto E F\nNumberof elementaryevents whicharefavourab le to F∩\n=(E F)\n(F)n\nn∩\nDividing the numerator and the denominator by total number of elementary events\nof the sample space, we see that P(E|F) can also be written as\nP(E|F) =(E F)\nP(E F) (S)\n(F) P(F)\n(S)n\nn\nn\nn∩\n∩= ... (1)\nNote that (1) is valid only when P(F) ≠ 0 i.e., F ≠ φ (Why?)\nThus, we can define the conditional probability as follows :\nDefinition 1 If  E and F are two events associated with the same sample space of a\nrandom experiment, the conditional probability of the event E given that F has occurred,\ni.e. P (E|F) is given by\nP(E|F) =P(E F)\nP(F)∩ provided P(F) ≠ 0\n13.2.1   Properties of conditional probability\nLet E and F be events of a sample space S of an experiment, then we have\nProperty 1  P(S|F) = P(F|F) = 1\nWe know that\nP(S|F) =P(S F) P(F)1\nP(F) P(F)∩= =\nAlso P(F|F) =P(F F) P(F)1P(F) P(F)∩= =\nThus P(S|F) = P(F|F) = 1\nProperty 2  If A  and B  are any two events of a sample space S and F  is an event\nof S such that P(F) ≠ 0, then\nP((A ∪ B)|F) =P(A|F) + P(B|F) – \nP((A ∩ B)|F)\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPROBABILITY      409\nIn par ticular , if A and B are disjoint events, then\nP((A∪B)|F) = P(A|F) + P(B|F)\nWe have\nP((A∪B)|F) =P[(A B) F]\nP(F)∪ ∩\n=P[(A F) (B F)]\nP(F)∩ ∪ ∩\n(by distributive law of union of sets over  intersection)\n=P(A F)+ P(B F) – P(A B F)\nP(F)∩ ∩ ∩ ∩\n=P(A F) P(B F) P[(A B) F]\nP(F) P(F) P(F)∩ ∩ ∩ ∩+ −\n=P(A|F) + P(B|F) – P((A∩B)|F)\nWhen A and B are disjoint events, then\nP((A ∩ B)|F) = 0\n⇒ P((A ∪ B)|F) = P(A|F) + P(B|F)\nProperty 3  P(E′|F) = 1 −  P(E|F)\nFrom Property 1, we know that P(S|F) = 1\n⇒ P(E ∪ E′|F) = 1    since  S = E ∪ E′\n⇒ P(E|F) + P (E\n′|F) = 1     since  E and E ′ are disjoint events\nThus, P(E′|F) = 1 − P(E|F)\nLet us now take up some examples.\nExample 1  If P(A) = 7\n13, P(B) = 9\n13 and P(A ∩ B) = 4\n13, evaluate P(A|B).\nSolution We have 4\nP(A B) 4 13P(A|B)=9 P(B) 9\n13∩= =\nExample 2  A family has two children.

However , the same definition can also be used in\nthe general case where the elementary events of the sample space are not equally\nlikely , the probabilities P(E∩F) and P (F) being calculated accordingly . Let us take up\nthe following example.\nExample 7  Consider the experiment of tossing a coin. If the coin shows head, toss it\nagain but if it shows tail, then throw a die.  Find the\nconditional probability of the event that ‘the die shows\na number greater than 4’ given that ‘there is at least\none tail’.\nSolution  The outcomes of the experiment can be\nrepresented in following diagrammatic manner called\nthe ‘tree diagram’.\nThe sample space of the experiment may be\ndescribed as\nS = {(H,H), (H,T), (T ,1), (T,2), (T,3), (T,4), (T,5), (T ,6)}\nwhere (H, H) denotes that both the tosses result into\nhead and (T , i) denote the first toss result into a tail and\nthe number i appeared on the die for i = 1,2,3,4,5,6.\nThus, the probabilities assigned to the 8 elementary\nevents\n(H, H) , (H, T), (T , 1), (T , 2), (T , 3) (T , 4), (T\n, 5), (T , 6)\nare 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1, , , , , , ,4 4 12 12 12 12 12 12 respectively which  is\nclear from the Fig 13.2.Fig 13.1\nFig 13.2\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPROBABILITY      413\nLet F be the event that ‘there is at least one tail ’ and E be the event ‘the die shows\na number greater than 4 ’.

If A and B are events such that P(A|B) = P(B|A), then\n(A) A ⊂ B but A ≠ B (B) A = B\n(C) A ∩ B = φ (D) P(A) = P(B)\n13.3  Multiplication Theorem on Probability\nLet E and F be two events associated with a sample space S. Clearly , the set E ∩ F\ndenotes the event that both E and F have occurred. In other words, E ∩ F denotes the\nsimultaneous occurrence of the events E and F . The event E ∩ F is also written as EF .\nVery often we need to find the probability of  the event EF . For example, in the\nexperiment of drawing two cards one after the other , we may be interested in finding\nthe probability of the event ‘a king and a queen ’. The probability of event EF is obtained\nby using the conditional probability as obtained below :\nWe know that the conditional probability of event E given that F has occurred is\ndenoted by P(E|F) and is given by\nP(E|F) =P(E F),P(F) 0P(F)∩≠\nFrom this result, we can write\nP(E ∩ F) = P(F) . P(E|F) ... (1)\nAlso, we know that\nP(F|E) =P(F E),P(E) 0P(E)∩≠\nor P(F|E) =P(E F)\nP(E)∩ (since E ∩ F = F ∩ E)\nThus, P(E ∩ F) = P(E). P(F|E) .... (2)\nCombining (1) and (2), we find that\nP(E ∩ F) = P(E) P(F|E)\n=P(F) P(E|F) provided P(E) ≠ 0 and P(F) ≠ 0.\nThe above result is known as the multiplication r ule of pr obability .\nLet us now take up an example.\nExample 8  An urn contains 10 black and 5 white balls. Two balls are drawn from the\nurn one after the other without replacement. What is the probability that both drawn\nballs are black?\nSolution Let E and F denote respectively the events that first and second ball drawn\nare black. We have to find P(E ∩ F) or P (EF).\nReprint 2025-26\n\n 416 MATHEMA TICS\nNow P(E) = P (black ball in first draw) = 10\n15\nAlso given that the first ball drawn is black, i.e., event E has occurred, now there\nare 9 black balls and five white balls left in the urn. Therefore, the probability that the\nsecond ball drawn is black, given that the ball in the first draw is black, is nothing but\nthe conditional probability of F given that E has occurred.\ni.e. P(F|E) =9\n14\nBy multiplication rule of probability , we have\nP(E ∩ F) = P(E) P(F|E)\n=10 9 3\n15 14 7× =\nMultiplication rule of probability for more than two events If E, F and G are\nthree events of sample space, we have\nP(E ∩ F ∩ G) = P(E) P(F|E) P(G|(E ∩ F)) = P(E) P(F|E) P(G|EF)\nSimilarly , the multiplication rule of probability can be extended for four or\nmore events.\nThe following example illustrates the extension of multiplication rule of probability\nfor three events.\nExample 9  Three cards are drawn successively , without replacement from a pack of\n52 well shuffled cards. What is the probability that first two cards are kings and the\nthird card drawn is an ace?\nSolution Let K denote the event that the card drawn is king and A be the event that\nthe card drawn is an ace. Clearly , we have to find P  (KKA)\nNow P(K) =4\n52\nAlso, P(K|K) is the probability of second king with the condition that one king has\nalready been drawn. Now there are three kings in (52  − 1) = 51 cards.\nTherefore P(K|K) =3\n51\nLastly , P(A|KK) is the probability of third drawn card to be an ace, with the condition\nthat two kings have already been drawn. Now there are four aces in left 50 cards.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPROBABILITY      417\nTherefore P(A|KK) =4\n50\nBy multiplication law of probability , we have\nP(KKA) = P(K)   P (K|K)  P(A|KK)\n=4 3 4 2\n52 51 50 5525× × =\n13.4  Independent Events\nConsider the experiment of drawing a card from a deck of 52 playing cards, in which\nthe elementary events are assumed to be equally likely . If E and F denote the events\n'the card drawn is a spade' and 'the card drawn is an ace' respectively , then\nP(E) =13 1 4 1and P(F)52 4 52 13= = =\nAlso E and F is the event ' the card drawn is the ace of spades' so that\nP(E∩F) =1\n52\nHence P(E|F) =1\nP(E F) 1 52\n1 P(F) 4\n13∩= =\nSince P(E) = 1\n4= P (E|F), we can say that the occurrence of event F has not\naffected the probability of occurrence of the event E.\nWe also have\nP(F|E) =1\nP(E F) 1 52P(F)1 P(E) 13\n4∩= = =\nAgain,  P (F) = 1\n13 = P(F|E) shows that occurrence of event E has not affected\nthe probability of occurrence of the event F .\nThus, E and F are two events such that the probability of occurrence of one of\nthem is not af fected by occurrence of the other .\nSuch events are called independent events .\nReprint 2025-26\n\n 418 MATHEMA TICS\nDefinition 2 T wo events E and F are said to be independent, if\nP(F|E) = P (F)  provided P (E)  ≠ 0\nand P(E|F) = P (E)  provided P (F)  ≠ 0\nThus, in this definition we need to have P (E) ≠ 0 and  P(F) ≠ 0\nNow , by the multiplication rule of probability , we have\nP(E ∩ F) = P(E) . P (F|E) ... (1)\nIf E and F are independent, then (1) becomes\nP(E ∩ F) = P(E) . P(F) ... (2)\nThus, using (2), the independence of two events is also defined as follows:\nDefinition 3  Let E and F be two events associated with the same random experiment,\nthen E and F are said to be independent if\nP(E ∩ F) = P(E) . P (F)\nRemarks\n(i)Two events E and F are said to be dependent if they are not independent, i.e. if\nP(E ∩ F ) ≠ P(E) . P (F)\n(ii) Sometimes there is a confusion between independent events and mutually\nexclusive events. Term ‘independent ’ is defined in terms of ‘probability of events ’\nwhereas mutually exclusive is defined in term of events (subset of sample space).\nMoreover , mutually exclusive events never have an outcome common, but\nindependent events, may have common outcome. Clearly , ‘independent ’ and\n‘mutually exclusive ’ do not have the same meaning.\nIn other words, two independent events having nonzero probabilities of occurrence\ncan not be mutually exclusive, and conversely , i.e. two mutually exclusive events\nhaving nonzero probabilities of occurrence can not be independent.\n(iii) Two experiments  are said to be independent if for every pair of events E and F ,\nwhere E is associated with the first experiment and F with the second experiment,\nthe probability of the simultaneous occurrence of the events E and F when the\ntwo experiments are performed is the product of P(E) and P(F) calculated\nseparately on the basis of two experiments, i.e., P (E ∩ F) = P (E) . P(F)\n(iv) Three events A, B and C are said to be mutually independent, if\nP(A ∩ B) = P(A) P(B)\nP(A ∩ C) = P(A) P(C)\nP(B ∩ C) = P(B) P(C)\nand P(A ∩ B ∩ C) = P(A) P(B) P(C)\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPROBABILITY      419\nIf at least one of the above is not true for three given events, we say that the\nevents are not independent.\nExample 10  A die is thrown. If E is the event ‘the number appearing is a multiple of\n3’ and F be the event ‘the number appearing is even ’ then find whether E and F are\nindependent ?\nSolution  We know that the sample space is S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\nNow E = { 3, 6}, F = { 2, 4, 6} and  E ∩ F = {6}\nThen P(E) = 2 1 3 1 1, P(F) and P(E  F)6 3 6 2 6= = = ∩ =\nClearly P(E ∩ F) = P(E). P (F)\nHence E and F are independent events.\nExample 1 1 An unbiased die is thrown twice. Let the event A be ‘odd number on the\nfirst throw ’ and B the event ‘odd number on the second throw ’. Check the independence\nof the events A and B.\nSolution If all the 36 elementary events of the experiment are considered to be equally\nlikely , we have\nP(A) =18 1\n36 2= and 18 1P(B)36 2= =\nAlso P(A ∩ B) = P (odd number on both throws)\n=9 1\n36 4=\nNow P(A) P(B) =1 1 1\n2 2 4× =\nClearly P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B)\nThus, A and B are independent events\nExample 12 Three coins are tossed simultaneously . Consider the event E ‘three heads\nor three tails ’, F ‘at least two heads ’ and G ‘at most two heads ’.

P(G)\nHence, the events (E and F) are independent, and the events (E and G) and\n(F and G) are dependent.\nExample 13  Prove that if E and F are independent events, then so are the events\nE and F′.\nSolution Since E and F are independent, we have\nP(E ∩ F) = P(E) . P(F) ....(1)\nFrom the venn diagram in Fig 13.3, it is clear\nthat E ∩ F and E ∩ F′ are mutually exclusive events\nand also  E = (E ∩ F) ∪ (E ∩ F′).\nTherefore P(E) = P(E ∩ F) + P(E ∩ F′)\nor P(E ∩ F′) =P(E) − P(E ∩ F)\n=P(E) − P(E) .

Bag I contains 2 white and 3 red balls and\nBag II contains 4 white and 5 red balls. One ball is drawn at random from one of the\nbags. We can find the probability of selecting any of the bags (i.e.1\n2) or probability of\ndrawing a ball of a particular colour (say white) from a particular bag (say Bag I). In\nother words, we can find the probability that the ball drawn is of a particular colour , if\nwe are given the bag from which the ball is drawn. But, can we find the probability that\nthe ball drawn is from a particular bag (say Bag II), if the colour of the ball drawn is\ngiven? Here, we have to find the reverse probability of Bag II to be selected when an\nevent occurred after it is known. Famous mathematician, John Bayes' solved the problem\nof finding reverse probability by using conditional probability. The formula developed\nby him is known as ‘Bayes theor em’ which was published posthumously in 1763.\nBefore stating and proving the Bayes' theorem, let us first take up a definition and\nsome preliminary results.\n13.5.1  Partition of a sample space\nA set of events E1, E2, ..., En is said to represent a partition of the sample space S if\n(a)Ei ∩ Ej = φ, i ≠ j, i, j = 1, 2, 3, ...,  n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n 424 MATHEMA TICS\nFig 13.4(b)E1 ∪ Ε2 ∪ ... ∪ En= S and\n(c)P(Ei) > 0 for all i = 1, 2, ..., n.\nIn other words, the events E1, E2, ..., En represent a partition of the sample space\nS if they are pairwise disjoint, exhaustive and have nonzero probabilities.\nAs an example, we see that any nonempty event E and its complement E ′ form a\npartition of the sample space S since they satisfy E ∩ E′ = φ and E ∪ E′ = S.\nFrom the Venn diagram in Fig 13.3, one can easily observe that if E and F are any\ntwo events associated with a sample space S, then the set  {E ∩ F′, E ∩ F, E′ ∩ F, E′ ∩ F′}\nis a partition of the sample space S. It may be mentioned that the partition of a sample\nspace is not unique. There can be several partitions of the same sample space.\nWe shall now prove a theorem known as Theor em of total pr obability .\n13.5.2  Theorem of total probability\nLet   {E1, E2,...,En}  be a partition of the sample space S,  and suppose that each of the\nevents E1, E2,..., En has nonzero probability of occurrence. Let A be any event associated\nwith S, then\nP(A) = P(E1) P(A|E1) + P(E2) P(A|E2) + ... + P(En) P(A|En)\n=\n1P(E ) P(A|E )n\nj j\nj=∑\nProof  Given that E1, E2,..., En is a partition of the sample space S (Fig 13.4). Therefore,\nS =E1 ∪ E2 ∪ ... ∪ En ... (1)\nand Ei ∩ Ej =φ, i ≠ j, i, j = 1, 2, ..., n\nNow , we know that for any event A,\nA =A ∩ S\n=A ∩ (E1 ∪ E2 ∪ ... ∪ En)\n=(A ∩ E1) ∪ (A ∩ E2) ∪ ...∪ (A ∩ En)\nAlso A ∩ Ei and A ∩ Ej are respectively the subsets of Ei and Ej. We know that\nEi  and Ej are disjoint, for ij≠, therefore, A  ∩ Ei and A  ∩ Ej  are also disjoint for all\ni ≠ j,  i, j = 1, 2, ..., n.\nThus, P(A) = P [(A ∩ E1) ∪ (A ∩ E2)∪ .....∪ (A ∩ En)]\n=P (A ∩ E1) + P (A ∩ E2) + ... + P (A \n∩ En)\nNow , by multiplication rule of probability , we have\nP(A ∩ Ei) =P(Ei) P(A|Ei) as  P (Ei) ≠ 0∀i = 1,2,..., n\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPROBABILITY      425\nTherefore, P (A) = P (E1) P (A|E1) + P (E2) P (A|E2) + ... + P (En)P(A|En)\nor P(A) =\n1P(E ) P(A|E )n\nj j\nj=∑\nExample 15  A person has undertaken a construction job. The probabilities are 0.65\nthat there will be strike, 0.80 that the construction job will be completed on time if there\nis no strike, and 0.32 that the construction job will be completed on time if there is a\nstrike. Determine the probability that the construction job will be completed on time.\nSolution Let A be the event that the construction job will be completed on time, and B\nbe the event that there will be a strike. We have to find P(A).\nWe have\nP(B) = 0.65, P(no strike) = P(B ′) = 1 − P(B) = 1 −  0.65 = 0.35\nP(A|B) = 0.32, P(A|B ′) = 0.80\nSince events B and B ′ form a partition of the sample space S, therefore, by theorem\non total probability , we have\nP(A) = P(B) P(A|B) + P(B ′) P(A|B ′)\n         = 0.65 × 0.32 + 0.35 × 0.8\n         = 0.208 + 0.28 = 0.488\nThus, the probability that the construction job will be completed in time is 0.488.\nWe shall now state and prove the Bayes' theorem.\nBayes’ Theorem If E1, E2 ,..., En are n non empty events which constitute a partition\nof sample space S, i.e. E1, E2 ,..., En are pairwise disjoint and E1∪ E2∪ ... ∪ En = S and\nA is any event of nonzero probability , then\nP(Ei|A) =\n1P(E ) P(A|E )\nP(E ) P(A|E )i i\nn\nj j\nj=∑   for any i = 1, 2, 3, ..., n\nProof By formula of conditional probability , we know that\nP(Ei|A) =P(A E )\nP(A)i∩\n=P(E )P(A|E )\nP(A)i i (by multiplication rule of probability)\n=\n1P(E ) P(A|E )\nP(E )P(A|E )i i\nn\nj j\nj=∑ (by the result of theorem of total probability)\nReprint 2025-26\n\n 426 MATHEMA TICS\nRemark   The following terminology is generally used when Bayes' theorem is applied.\nThe events E1, E2, ..., En are  called hypotheses.\nThe probability P(Ei) is called the priori pr obability  of the hypothesis Ei\nThe conditional probability P(Ei |A) is called a posteriori pr obability of the\nhypothesis Ei.\nBayes' theorem is also called the formula for the probability of \"causes\". Since the\nEi's are a partition of the sample space S, one and only one of the events Ei occurs (i.e.\none of the events Ei must occur and only one can occur). Hence, the above formula\ngives us the probability of a particular Ei (i.e. a \"Cause\"), given that the event A has\noccurred.\nThe Bayes'  theorem has its applications in variety of situations, few of which are\nillustrated in following examples.\nExample 16  Bag I contains 3 red and 4 black balls while another Bag II contains 5 red\nand 6 black balls. One ball is drawn at random from one of the bags and it is found to\nbe red. Find the probability that it was drawn from Bag II.\nSolution  Let E1 be the event of choosing the bag I, E2 the event of choosing the bag II\nand A be the event of drawing a red ba ll.\nThen P(E1) =P(E2) =  1\n2\nAlso P(A|E1) =P(drawing a red ball from Bag I) = 3\n7\nand P(A|E2) =P(drawing a red ball from Bag II) = 5\n11\nNow , the probability of drawing a ball from Bag II, being given that it is red,\nis P(E2|A)\nBy using Bayes' theorem, we have\nP(E2|A) =2 2\n1 1 2 2P(E )P(A|E )\nP(E )P(A|E )+ P(E )P(A|E ) = 1 5\n35 2 11\n1 3 1 5 68\n2 7 2 11×\n=\n× + ×\nExample 17 Given three identical boxes I, II and III, each containing two coins.

A treatise on gambling\nnamed liber de Ludo Alcae , by Geronimo Carden (1501-1576) was published\nposthumously in 1663. In this treatise, he gives the number of favourable cases\nfor each event when two  dice are thrown.\nGalileo (1564-1642) gave casual remarks concerning the correct evaluation\nof chance in a game of three dice. Galileo analysed that when three dice are\nthrown, the sum of the number that appear is more likely to be 10 than the sum 9,\nbecause the number of cases favourable to 10 are more than the number of\ncases for the appearance of number 9.\nApart from these early contributions, it is generally acknowledged that the\ntrue origin of the science of probability lies in the correspondence between two\ngreat men of the seventeenth century , Pascal (1623-1662) and Pierre de Fermat\n(1601-1665). A French gambler , Chevalier de Metre asked Pascal to explain\nsome seeming contradiction between his theoretical reasoning and the\nobservation gathered from gambling. In a series of letters written around 1654,\nPascal and Fermat laid the first foundation of science of probability . Pascal solved\nthe problem in algebraic manner while Fermat used the method of combinations.\nGreat Dutch Scientist, Huygens (1629-1695), became acquainted with the\ncontent of the correspondence between Pascal and Fermat and published a first\nbook on probability , \"De Ratiociniis in Ludo Aleae \" containing solution of many\ninteresting rather than difficult problems on probability in games of chances.\nThe next great work on probability theory is by Jacob Bernoulli (1654-1705),\nin the form of a great book, \" Ars Conjectendi \" published posthumously in 1713\nby his nephew , Nicholes Bernoulli. To him is due the discovery of one of the most\nimportant probability distribution known as Binomial distribution. The next\nremarkable work on probability lies in 1993. A. N. Kolmogorov (1903-1987) is\ncredited with the axiomatic theory of probability . His book, ‘Foundations of\nprobability’ published in 1933, introduces probability as a set function and is\nconsidered a ‘classic!’.\n—/xrhombus/xrhombus/xrhombus/xrhombus/xrhombus—\nReprint 2025-26\n\n",
