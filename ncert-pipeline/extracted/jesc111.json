Let us consider the analogy of\nflow of water . Char ges do not flow in a copper wir e by themselves, just as\nwater in a perfectly horizontal tube does not flow. If one end of the tube\nis connected to a tank of water kept at a higher level, such that there is a\npressure difference between the two ends of the tube, water flows out of\nthe other end of the tube. For flow of charges in a conducting metallic\nwire, the gravity, of course, has no role to play; the electrons move only\nif there is a difference of electric pressure – called the potential differenc e –\nalong the conductor . This dif ference of potential may be pr oduced by a\nbattery, consisting of one or more electric cells. The chemical action within\na cell generates the potential difference across the terminals of the cell,\neven when no current is drawn from it. When the cell is connected to a\nconducting circuit element, the potential difference sets the charges in\nmotion in the conductor and produces an electric current. In order to\nmaintain the current in a given electric circuit, the cell has to expend its\nchemical energy stored in it.\nWe define the electric potential dif ference between two points in an\nelectric circuit carrying some current as the work done to move a unit\ncharge from one point to the other –\nPotential dif ference ( V) between two points = Work done ( W)/Char ge (Q)\nV=W/Q (11.2)\nThe SI unit of electric potential difference is volt (V), named after\nAlessandr o Volta (174 5–1827), an Italian physicist. \nOne volt is the\npotential difference between two points in a current carrying conductor\nwhen 1 joule of work is done to move a charge of 1 coulomb from one\npoint to the other .\nTherefore, 1 volt =  1 joule\n1 coulomb\n(11.3)\n1 V  = 1 J C–1\nThe potential difference is measured by means of an instrument called\nthe voltmeter . The voltmeter is always connected in parallel across the\npoints between which the potential difference is to be measured.\nExample 11.2\nHow much work is done in moving a charge of 2 C across two points\nhaving a potential difference 12 V?\nSolution\nThe amount of charge Q,  that flows between two points at potential\ndifference V (= 12 V) is 2 C. Thus, the amount of work W,  done in\nmoving the charge [from Eq. (11.2)] is\nReprint 2025-26\n\nScience 174W= VQ\n= 12 V × 2 C\n= 24 J.\nQUESTIONS\n?\n11.3 CIRCUIT DIAGRAM11.3 CIRCUIT DIAGRAM11.3 CIRCUIT DIAGRAM11.3 CIRCUIT DIAGRAM11.3 CIRCUIT DIAGRAM\nWe know that an electric cir cuit, as shown in Fig. 11.1, comprises a cell\n(or a battery), a plug key, electrical component(s), and connecting wires.\nIt is often convenient to draw a schematic diagram, in which different\ncomponents of the circuit are represented by the symbols conveniently\nused.

Let us explore with an Activity.\nActivity 11.1Activity 11.1Activity 11.1Activity 11.1Activity 11.1\n/square6Set up a circuit as shown in Fig. 11.2,\nconsisting of a nichrome wire XY of length,\nsay 0.5 m, an ammeter , a voltmeter and\nfour cells of 1.5 V each. (Nichrome is an\nalloy of nickel, chromium, manganese, and\niron metals.)\n/square6First use only one cell as the source in the\ncircuit. Note the reading in the ammeter I,\nfor the current and reading of the voltmeter\nV for the potential difference across the\nnichrome wire XY in the circuit.

A\nstraight line plot shows that as the\ncurrent through a wire increases, the\npotential difference across the wire\nincreases linearly  – this is Ohm’s law.\nActivity 11.2Activity 11.2Activity 11.2Activity 11.2Activity 11.2\n/square6Take a nichrome wire, a torch bulb, a 10 W bulb and an ammeter (0 – 5 A range), a plug\nkey and some connecting wires.\n/square6Set up the circuit by connecting four dry cells of 1.5 V each in series with the ammeter\nleaving a gap XY in the circuit, as shown in Fig. 11.4.In this Activity, you will find that approximately the\nsame value for V/I  is obtained in each case. Thus the V–I\ngraph is a straight line that passes through the origin of\nthe graph, as shown in Fig. 11.3. Thus, V/I is a constant\nratio.\nIn 1827, a German physicist Georg Simon Ohm\n(1787–1854) found out the relationship between the current\nI, flowing in a metallic wire and the potential difference\nacross its terminals. The potential difference, V, across the\nends of a given metallic wire in an electric circuit is directly\nproportional to the current flowing through it,  provided its\ntemperature remains the same. This is called Ohm’s law. In\nother words –\nV ∝ I (11.4)\nor V/I =constant\n=R\nor V =IR (11.5)\nIn Eq. (11.4), R is a constant for the given metallic wire\nat a given temperature and is called its resistance. It is the\nproperty of a conductor to resist the flow of charges\n  through it. Its SI\nunit is ohm, r epresented by the Gr eek letter Ω. Accor ding to Ohm’s law,\nR = V/I (11.6)\nIf the potential difference across the two ends of a conductor is 1 V\nand the current through it is 1 A, then the resistance R, of the conductor\nis 1 Ω. That is, 1 ohm = 1 volt\n1 ampere\nAlso from Eq. (11.5) we get\nI = V/R (11.7)\nIt is obvious from Eq. (11.7) that the current through a resistor is\ninversely proportional to its resistance. If the resistance is doubled the\ncurrent gets halved. In many practical cases it is necessary to increase\nor decrease the current in an electric circuit. A component used to\nregulate current without changing the voltage source is called variable\nresistance. In an electric circuit, a device called rheostat is often used to\nchange the resistance in the cir cuit. W e will now study about electrical\nresistance of a conductor with the help of following Activity.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nElectricity 177In this Activity we observe that the current is different for different\ncomponents. Why do they differ? Certain components offer an easy path\nfor the flow of electric curr ent while the others r esist the flow. W e know\nthat motion of electrons in an electric circuit constitutes an electric\ncurrent. The electr ons, however , are not completely fr ee to move within a\nconductor . They ar e restrained by the attraction of the atoms among\nwhich they move. Thus, motion of electrons through a conductor is\nretarded by its resistance. A component of a given size that offers a low\nresistance is a good conductor . A conductor having some appreciable\nresistance is called a r esistor . A component of identical size that of fers a\nhigher r esistance is a poor conductor . An insulator of the same size of fers\neven higher resistance.\n11.5 FA 11.5 FA11.5 FA11.5 FA11.5 FA CTORS ON WHICH THE RESISTCTORS ON WHICH THE RESISTCTORS ON WHICH THE RESISTCTORS ON WHICH THE RESISTCTORS ON WHICH THE RESIST ANCE OF AANCE OF AANCE OF AANCE OF AANCE OF A\nCONDUCTOR DEPENDSCONDUCTOR DEPENDSCONDUCTOR DEPENDSCONDUCTOR DEPENDSCONDUCTOR DEPENDSFigure 11.4Figure 11.4Figure 11.4Figure 11.4Figure 11.4\n/square6Complete the cir cuit by connecting the nichr ome wir e in the gap XY . Plug the key. Note\ndown the ammeter reading. Take out the key from the plug. [Note:  Always take out the key\nfrom the plug after measuring the current through the circuit. ]\n/square6Replace the nichrome wire with the torch bulb in the circuit and find the current through\nit by measuring the r eading of the ammeter .\n/square6Now r epeat the above step with the 10 W bulb in the gap XY .\n/square6Are the ammeter readings different for different components connected in the gap XY?\nWhat do the above observations indicate?\n/square6You may r epeat this Activity by keeping any material component in the gap. Observe the\nammeter readings in each case. Analyse the observations.\nActivity 11.3Activity 11.3Activity 11.3Activity 11.3Activity 11.3\n/square6Complete an electric cir cuit consisting of a cell, an ammeter , a nichrome wir e of length l\n[say, marked (1)]  and a plug key, as shown in Fig. 11.5.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nScience 178It is observed that the ammeter reading decreases to one-half when\nthe length of the wire is doubled. The ammeter reading is increased when\na thicker wire of the same material and of the same length is used in the\ncircuit. A change in ammeter reading is observed when a wire of different\nmaterial of the same length and the same area of cross-section is used.\nOn applying Ohm’s law [Eqs. (11.5) – (11.7)], we observe that the\nresistance of the conductor depends (i) on its length, (ii) on its area of\ncross-section, and (iii) on the nature of its material. Precise measurements\nhave shown that resistance of a uniform metallic conductor is directly\nproportional to its length (l ) and inversely proportional to the area of\ncross-section ( A). That is,\nR ∝ l (11.8)\nand R ∝ 1/A (11.9)\nCombining Eqs. (11.8) and (11.9) we get\nR ∝ l\nA\nor, R = ρl\nA(11.10)\nwhere ρ (rho) is a constant of proportionality and is called the electrical\nresistivity of the material of the conductor . The SI unit of resistivity is\nΩ m. It is a characteristic property of the material.

A\nthicker wire has a larger cross-sectional area. Again note down the current through the\ncircuit.\n/square6Instead of taking a nichrome wire, connect a copper wire [marked (4) in Fig. 11.5] in the\ncircuit. Let the wire be of the same length and same area of cross-section as that of the\nfirst nichrome wire [marked (1)]. Note the value of the current.\n/square6Notice the difference in the current in all cases.\n/square6Does the current depend on the length of the conductor?\n/square6Does the current depend on the area of cross-section of the wire used?\nReprint 2025-26\n\nElectricity 179have very low resistivity in the  range of 10–8 Ω m to  10–6 Ω m. They are\ngood conductors of electricity. Insulators like rubber and glass have\nresistivity of the order of 1012 to 1017 Ω m. Both the resistance and\nresistivity of a material vary with temperature.\nTable 11.2 reveals that the resistivity of an alloy is generally higher\nthan that of its constituent metals. Alloys do not oxidise (burn) readily\nat high temperatures. For this reason, they are commonly used in\nelectrical heating devices, like electric iron, toasters etc. Tungsten is used\nalmost exclusively for filaments of electric bulbs, whereas copper and\naluminium are generally used for electrical transmission lines.\nTable 11.2  Electrical resistivity*  of some substances at 20°C\nMaterial Resistivity ( Ω ΩΩΩΩ m)\nConductors Silver 1.60 × 10–8\nCopper 1.62 × 10–8\nAluminium 2.63 × 10–8\nTungsten 5.20 × 10–8\nNickel 6.84 × 10–8\nIron 10.0 × 10–8\nChromium 12.9 × 10–8\nMercury 94.0 × 10–8\nManganese 1.84 × 10–6\nAlloys Constantan 49 × 10–6\n(alloy of Cu and Ni)\nManganin 44 × 10–6\n(alloy of Cu, Mn and Ni)\nNichrome 100 × 10–6\n(alloy of Ni, Cr\n, Mn and Fe)\nInsulators Glass 1010 – 1014\nHard rubber 1013 – 1016\nEbonite 1015 – 1017\nDiamond 1012 - 1013\nPaper (dry) 1012\n* You need not memorise these values.

(b) How much\ncurrent will an electric heater coil draw from a 220 V source, if\nthe resistance of the heater coil is 100 Ω?\nSolution\n(a)We are given V = 220 V ; R = 1200 Ω.\nFrom Eq. (12.6), we have the current I = 220 V/1200 Ω = 0.18 A.\n(b)We are given, V = 220 V , R = 100 Ω.\nFrom Eq.

W e\nhave noticed how the current through a conductor depends upon its\nresistance and the potential difference across its ends. In various electrical\ngadgets, we often use resistors in various combinations. W e now ther efore\nintend to see how Ohm’s law can be applied to combinations of resistors.\nThere ar e two methods of joining the r esistors together . Figur e 11.6\nshows an electric circuit in which three resistors having resistances R1,\nR2 and R3, respectively, are joined end to end. Here the resistors are said\nto be connected in series.\nFigure 11.6Figure 11.6Figure 11.6Figure 11.6Figure 11.6  Resistors in series\nReprint 2025-26\n\nScience 182Figure 11.7Figure 11.7Figure 11.7Figure 11.7Figure 11.7  Resistors in parallel\nYou will observe that the value of the current in the ammeter is the\nsame, independent of its position in the electric circuit. It means that in\na series combination of resistors the current is the same in every part of\nthe cir cuit or the same curr ent thr ough each r esistor .Activity 11.4Activity 11.4Activity 11.4Activity 11.4Activity 11.4\n/square6Join three resistors of different values in series. Connect them\nwith a battery, an ammeter and a plug key, as shown in Fig. 11.6.\nYou may use the r esistors of values like 1 Ω, 2 Ω, 3 Ω etc., and a\nbattery of 6 V for performing this Activity.\n/square6Plug the key. Note the ammeter reading.\n/square6Change the position of ammeter to anywhere in between the\nresistors. Note the ammeter reading each time.\n/square6Do you find any change in the value of current through the\nammeter?11.6.1 Resistors in Series\nWhat happens to the value of current when a number of resistors are\nconnected in series in a circuit? What would be their equivalent\nresistance? Let us try to understand these with the help of the following\nactivities.Figure 11.7 shows a combination of resistors in which three resistors\nare connected together between points X and Y . Here, the r esistors are\nsaid to be connected in parallel.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nElectricity 183Activity 11.5Activity 11.5Activity 11.5Activity 11.5Activity 11.5\n/square6In Activity 11.4, insert a voltmeter across the ends X and Y of the\nseries combination of three resistors, as shown in Fig. 11.6.\n/square6Plug the key in the circuit and note the voltmeter reading. It\ngives the potential difference across the series combination of\nresistors. Let it be V. Now measur e the potential dif ference acr oss\nthe two terminals of the battery. Compare the two values.\n/square6Take out the plug key and disconnect the voltmeter . Now insert\nthe voltmeter acr oss the ends X and P of the first r esistor , as\nshown in Fig. 11.8.\nFigure 11.8Figure 11.8Figure 11.8Figure 11.8Figure 11.8\n/square6Plug the key and measure the potential difference across the first\nresistor . Let it be V1.\n/square6Similarly, measure the potential difference across the other two\nresistors, separately. Let these values be V2 and V3, respectively.\n/square6Deduce a relationship between V, V1, V2 and V3.\nYou will observe that the potential dif ference V is equal to the sum of\npotential differences V1, V2, and V3. That is the total potential difference\nacross a combination of resistors in series is equal to the sum of potential\ndifference across the individual resistors. That is,\nV = V1 + V2  + V3(11.11)\nIn the electric circuit shown in Fig. 11.8, let I be the current through\nthe circuit. The current through each resistor is also I . It is possible to\nreplace the three resistors joined in series by an equivalent single resistor\nof resistance R, such that the potential difference \nV across it, and the\ncurrent I through the circuit remains the same. Applying the Ohm’s law\nto the entire circuit, we have\nV = I R (11.12)\nReprint 2025-26\n\nScience 184On applying Ohm’s law to the three resistors separately, we further\nhave\nV1=I R1[11.13(a)]\nV2=I R2[11.13(b)]\nand V3=I R3[11.13(c)]\nFrom Eq. (11.11),\nI R= I R1 + I R2 + I R3\nor\nRs= R1 +R2 + R3(11.14)\nWe can conclude that when several r esistors ar e joined in series, the\nresistance of the combination Rs equals the sum of their individual\nresistances, R1, R2, R3, and is thus greater than any individual resistance.\nExample 11.7\nAn electric lamp, whose resistance is 20 Ω, and a conductor of 4 Ω\nresistance are connected to a 6 V battery (Fig. 11.9). Calculate (a) the\ntotal resistance of the circuit, (b) the current through the circuit, and (c)\nthe potential dif ference acr oss the electric lamp and conductor .\nSolution\nThe resistance of electric lamp, R1 = 20 Ω ,\nThe r esistance of the conductor connected in series, R2 = 4 Ω.\nThen the total resistance in the circuit\nR= R1 + R2\nRs=20 Ω + 4 Ω\n = 24 Ω.\nThe total potential difference across the two terminals of the battery\nV = 6 V .\nNow by Ohm’s law, the current through the circuit is given by\nI=V/Rs\n=6 V/24 Ω\n=0.25 A.Figure 11.9Figure 11.9Figure 11.9Figure 11.9Figure 11.9  An electric lamp connected in series with\na resistor of 4 Ω to a 6 V battery\nReprint 2025-26\n\nElectricity 185Applying Ohm’s law to the electric lamp and conductor separately,\nwe get potential difference across the electric lamp,\nV1=20 Ω × 0.25 A\n=5 V;\nand,\nthat acr oss the conductor , V2  =  4 Ω × 0.25 A\n         =  1 V .\nSuppose that we like to replace the series combination of electric\nlamp and conductor by a single and equivalent r esistor . Its resistance\nmust be such that a potential difference of 6 V across the battery\nterminals will cause a current of 0.25 A in the circuit. The resistance\nR of this equivalent resistor would be\nR=V/I\n=6 V/ 0.25 A\n=24 Ω.\nThis is the total resistance of the series circuit; it is equal to the sum\nof the two resistances.\nQUESTIONS\n?1. Draw a schematic diagram of a circuit consisting of a battery of three\ncells of 2 V each, a 5 Ω resistor , an 8 Ω resistor , and a 12 Ω resistor , and\na plug key, all connected in series.\n2. Redraw the circuit of Question 1, putting in an ammeter to measure\nthe current through the resistors and a voltmeter to measure the\npotential dif ference acr oss the 12 Ω resistor . What would be the r eadings\nin the ammeter and the voltmeter?\n11.6.2 Resistors in Parallel\nNow, let us consider the arrangement of three resistors joined in parallel\nwith a combination of cells (or a battery), as shown in Fig.11.7.\nActivity 11.6Activity 11.6Activity 11.6Activity 11.6Activity 11.6\n/square6Make a parallel combination, XY, of three\nresistors having resistances R1, R2, and R3,\nrespectively. Connect it with a battery, a\nplug key and an ammeter , as shown in\nFig. 11.10. Also connect a voltmeter in\nparallel with the combination of resistors.\n/square6Plug the key and note the ammeter reading.\nLet the current be I. Also take the voltmeter\nreading. It gives the potential difference V,\nacross the combination. The potential\ndifference acr oss each r esistor is also V. This\ncan be checked by connecting the voltmeter\nacross each individual resistor (see\nFig. 11.11).Figure 11.10Figure 11.10Figure 11.10Figure 11.10Figure 11.10\nReprint 2025-26\n\nScience 186/square6Take out the plug from the key. Remove the ammeter and voltmeter from the circuit.\nInsert the ammeter in series with the resistor R1, as shown in Fig. 11.11. Note the ammeter\nreading, I1.\nFigure 11.11Figure 11.11Figure 11.11Figure 11.11Figure 11.11\n/square6Similarly, measure the currents through R2 and R3. Let these be I2 and I3, respectively.\nWhat is the relationship between I, I1, I2 and I3?\nIt is observed that the total current I , is equal to the sum of the\nseparate currents through each branch of the combination.\nI = I1 + I2 + I3(11.15)\nLet Rp be the equivalent resistance of the parallel combination of\nresistors. By applying Ohm’s law to the parallel combination of resistors,\nwe have\nI = V/Rp(11.16)\nOn applying Ohm’s law to each resistor , we have\nI1 = V /R1;    I2 = V /R2; and I3 = V /R3(11.17)\nFrom Eqs. (11.15) to (11.17), we have\n  V/Rp = V/R1 + V/R2 + V/R3\nor\n  1/Rp = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3(11.18)\nThus, we may conclude that the reciprocal of the equivalent resistance\nof a group of resistances joined in parallel is equal to the sum of the\nreciprocals of the individual resistances.\nExample 11.8\nIn the circuit diagram given in Fig. 11.10, suppose the resistors R1,\nR2 and R3 have the values 5 Ω, 10 Ω, 30 Ω, respectively, which have\nbeen connected to a battery of 12 V . Calculate (a) the curr ent thr ough\neach r esistor , (b) the total curr ent in the cir cuit, and (c) the total cir cuit\nresistance.\nSolution\nR1 = 5 Ω, R2 = 10 Ω, and R3 = 30 Ω.\nPotential dif ference acr oss the battery, V = 12 V .\nThis is also the potential difference across each of the individual\nresistor; therefore, to calculate the current in the resistors, we use\nOhm’s law.\nThe current  I1, through R1 = V/ R1\nI1=12 V/5 \nΩ  = 2.4 A.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nElectricity 187The current  I2, through R2=V/ R2\nI2=12 V/10 Ω=1.2 A.\nThe current  I3, through R3=V/R3\nI3=12 V/30 Ω=0.4 A.\nThe total current in the circuit,\nI= I1 + I2 + I3\n=(2.4 + 1.2 + 0.4) A\n=4 A\nThe total resistance Rp, is given by [Eq. (11.18)]\n1 1 1 1 1\n5 10 30 3pR= + + =\nThus, Rp = 3 Ω.\nExample 11.9\nIf in Fig. 11.12, R1 = 10 Ω, R2 = 40 Ω, R3 = 30 Ω, R4 = 20 Ω, R5 = 60 Ω,\nand a 12 V battery is connected to the arrangement. Calculate\n(a) the total resistance in the circuit, and (b) the total current flowing\nin the circuit.\nSolution\nSuppose we replace the parallel resistors R1 and R2 by an\nequivalent resistor of resistance, R ′. Similarly we replace\nthe parallel resistors R3, R4 and R5 by an equivalent single\nresistor of resistance R″. Then using Eq. (11.18), we have\n1/ R′ = 1/10 + 1/40 =5/40; that is R′  = 8 Ω .\nSimilarly, 1/ R″=1/30 + 1/20 + 1/60 = 6/60;\nthat is, R″  = 10 Ω.\nThus, the total resistance, R  = R′ + R″ = 18 Ω.\nTo calculate the current, we use Ohm’s law, and get\n I = V/R = 12 V/18 Ω = 0.67 A.\nWe have seen that in a series cir cuit the curr ent is constant\nthroughout the electric circuit. Thus it is obviously impracticable to\nconnect an electric bulb and an electric heater in series, because they\nneed currents of widely different values to operate properly (see Example\n11.3). Another major disadvantage of a series circuit is that when one\ncomponent fails the circuit is broken and none of the components works.\nIf you have used ‘fairy lights’ to decorate buildings on festivals, on\nmarriage celebrations etc., you might have seen the electrician spending\nlot of time in trouble-locating and replacing the ‘dead’ bulb – each has\nto be tested to find which has fused or gone. On the other hand, a parallel\ncircuit divides the current through the electrical gadgets. The total\nresistance in a parallel circuit is decreased as per Eq. (11.18). This is\nhelpful particularly when each gadget has different resistance and\nrequires different current to operate properly.Figure 11.12Figure 11.12Figure 11.12Figure 11.12Figure 11.12\nAn electric circuit showing\nthe combination of series\nand parallel resistors\nReprint 2025-26\n\nScience 18811.7 HEA 11.7 HEA11.7 HEA 11.7 HEA11.7 HEA TING EFFECT OF ELECTRIC CURRENTTING EFFECT OF ELECTRIC CURRENTTING EFFECT OF ELECTRIC CURRENTTING EFFECT OF ELECTRIC CURRENTTING EFFECT OF ELECTRIC CURRENT\nWe know that a battery or a cell is a sour ce of electrical ener gy. The\nchemical reaction within the cell generates the potential difference between\nits two terminals that sets the electrons in motion to flow the current\nthrough a r esistor or a system of r esistors connected to the battery. W e\nhave also seen, in Section 11.2, that to maintain the current, the source\nhas to keep expending its energy. Where does this energy go? A part of\nthe source energy in maintaining the current may be consumed into\nuseful work (like in rotating the blades of an electric fan). Rest of the\nsource energy may be expended in heat to raise the temperature of\ngadget. W e often observe this in our everyday life. For example, an electric\nfan becomes warm if used continuously for longer time etc. On the other\nhand, if the electric circuit is purely resistive, that is, a configuration of\nresistors only connected to a battery; the source energy continually gets\ndissipated entirely in the form of heat. This is known as the heating\neffect of electric current. This effect is utilised in devices such as electric\nheater , electric ir on etc.\nConsider a current I flowing through a resistor of resistance \nR. Let\nthe potential difference across it be  V (Fig. 11.13). Let t be the time during\nwhich a charge Q flows across. The work done in moving the charge Q\nthrough a potential difference V is VQ. Therefore, the source must supply\nenergy equal to VQ in time t. Hence the power input to the circuit by the\nsource is\nP V VI =Q\nt= (11.19)\nOr the energy supplied to the circuit by the source in time t  is P × t,\nthat is, VIt. What happens to this energy expended by the source? This\nenergy gets dissipated in the resistor as heat. Thus for a steady\ncurrent  I, the amount of heat \nH produced in time t is\nH = VIt (11.20)QUESTIONS\n?1. Judge the equivalent resistance when the following are connected in\nparallel – (a) 1 Ω and 106 Ω, (b) 1 Ω and 103 Ω, and 106 Ω.\n2. An electric lamp of 100 Ω, a toaster of resistance 50 Ω, and a water\nfilter of resistance 500 Ω are connected in parallel to a 220 V source.\nWhat is the resistance of an electric iron connected to the same source\nthat takes as much current as all three appliances, and what is the\ncurrent through it?\n3. What are the advantages of connecting electrical devices in parallel\nwith the battery instead of connecting them in series?\n4. How can three resistors of resistances 2 Ω, 3 Ω, and 6 Ω be connected\nto give a total resistance of (a) 4 Ω, (b) 1 Ω?\n5. What is (a) the highest, (b) the lowest total resistance that can be secured\nby combinations of four coils of resistance 4 Ω, 8 Ω, 12 Ω, 24 Ω?\nReprint 2025-26\n\nElectricity 189Applying Ohm’s law [Eq. (11.5)], we get\nH = I2 Rt (11.21)\nThis is known as Joule’s law of heating. The\nlaw implies that heat produced in a resistor is\n(i) directly proportional to the square of current\nfor a given  resistance, (ii) directly proportional to\nresistance for a given current, and (iii) directly\nproportional to the time for which the current flows\nthrough the r esistor . In practical situations, when\nan electric appliance is connected to a known\nvoltage source, Eq. (11.21) is used after\ncalculating the current through it, using the\nrelation I = V/R .\nExample 11.10\nAn electric iron consumes energy at a rate of 840 W when heating is\nat the maximum rate and 360 W when the heating is at the minimum.\nThe voltage is 220 V . What ar e the curr ent and the r esistance in each\ncase?\nSolution\nFrom Eq. (11.19), we know that the power input is\nP = V I\nThus the current I = P/V\n(a)When heating is at the maximum rate,\nI = 840 W/220 V = 3.82 A;\nand the resistance of the electric iron is\nR = V/I = 220 V/3.82 A = 57.60 Ω.\n(b)When heating is at the minimum rate,\nI = 360 W/220 V = 1.64 A;\nand the resistance of the electric iron is\nR = V/I = 220 V/1.64 A = 134.15 Ω.\nExample 11.11\n100 J of heat is produced each second in a 4 Ω  resistance. Find the\npotential dif ference acr oss the r esistor .\nSolution\nH = 100 J, R = 4 Ω, t = 1 s, V = ?\nFrom Eq. (11.21) we have the current through the resistor as\nI = √(H/Rt )\n= √[100 J/(4 Ω ×\n 1 s)]\n=5 A\nThus the potential dif ference acr oss the r esistor , V [from Eq. (11.5)] is\nV=IR\n=5 A × 4 Ω\n=20 V.Figure 11.13Figure 11.13Figure 11.13Figure 11.13Figure 11.13\nA steady current in a purely resistive electric circuit\nReprint 2025-26\n\nScience 19011.7.1 Practical Applications of Heating Effect of\nElectric Current\nThe generation of heat in a conductor is an inevitable consequence of\nelectric current. In many cases, it is undesirable as it converts useful\nelectrical energy into heat. In electric circuits, the unavoidable heating\ncan increase the temperature of the components and alter their properties.\nHowever , heating ef fect of electric curr ent has many useful applications.\nThe electric laundry ir on, electric toaster , electric oven, electric kettle\nand electric heater are some of the familiar devices based on Joule’s\nheating.\nThe electric heating is also used to produce light, as in an electric\nbulb. Here, the filament must retain as much of the heat generated as is\npossible, so that it gets very hot and emits light. It must not melt at such\nhigh temperature. A strong metal with high melting point such as\ntungsten (melting point 3380°C) is used for making bulb filaments. The\nfilament should be thermally isolated as much as possible, using\ninsulating support, etc. The bulbs are usually filled with chemically\ninactive nitrogen and argon gases to prolong the life of filament. Most of\nthe power consumed by the filament appears as heat, but a small part\nof it is in the form of light radiated.\nAnother common application of Joule’s heating is the fuse used  in\nelectric circuits. It protects circuits and appliances by stopping the flow\nof any unduly high electric current. The fuse is placed in series with\nthe device. It consists of a piece of wire made of a metal or an alloy of\nappropriate melting point, for example aluminium, copper , iron, lead\netc. If a current larger than the specified value flows through the circuit,\nthe temperature of the fuse wire increases. This melts the fuse wire and\nbreaks the circuit. The fuse wire is usually encased in a cartridge of\nporcelain or similar material with metal ends. The fuses used for domestic\npurposes are rated as 1 A, 2 A, 3 A, 5 A, 10 A, etc. For an electric iron\nwhich consumes 1 kW electric power when operated at 220 V, a current\nof (1000/220) A, that is, 4.54 A will flow in the circuit. In this case, a 5 A\nfuse must be used.QUESTIONS\n?1. Why does the cord of an electric heater not glow while the heating element\ndoes?\n2.

This is also the rate of consumption of ener gy.\nEquation (11.21) gives the rate at which electric energy is dissipated\nor consumed in an electric cir cuit. This is also ter med as electric power .\nThe power P is given by\nP  =  VI\nOr P  =  I2R = V2/R (11.22)\nThe SI unit of electric power is watt (W). It is the power consumed by\na device that carries 1 A of current when operated at a potential difference\nof 1 V . Thus,\n       1 W  =  1 volt × 1 ampere = 1 V A (11.23)\nThe unit ‘watt’ is very small. Therefore, in actual practice we use a\nmuch larger unit called ‘kilowatt’. It is equal to 1000 watts. Since electrical\nenergy is the product of power and time, the unit of electric energy is,\ntherefore, watt hour (W h). One watt hour is the energy consumed when\n1 watt of power is used for 1 hour . The commer cial unit of electric ener gy\nis kilowatt hour (kW h), commonly known as ‘unit’.\n1 kW h =1000 watt × 3600 second\n=3.6 × 106 watt second\n=3.6 × 106 joule (J)More to Know!Many people think that electrons are consumed in an electric circuit.
