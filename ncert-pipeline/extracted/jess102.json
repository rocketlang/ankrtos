The thrust of the programme was\ntowards protecting the remaining population\nof certain endangered species by banning\nhunting, giving legal protection to their\nhabitats, and restricting trade in wildlife.\nSubsequently, central and many state\ngovernments established national parks and\nwildlife sanctuaries about which you have\nalready studied. The central government also\nannounced several projects for protecting\nspecific animals, which were gravely\nthreatened, including the tiger , the one-\nhorned r hinocer os, the Kashmir stag or\nhangul , three types of crocodiles – fresh\nwater crocodile, saltwater crocodile and the\nGharial , the Asiatic lion, and others. Most\nrecently, the Indian elephant, black buck\n(chinkara), the great Indian bustard\n(godawan ) and the snow leopard, etc. have\nbeen given full or partial legal protection\nagainst hunting and trade throughout India.Fig. 2.1\nTribal girls using bamboo saplings in a\nnursery at Mukhali near Silent V alley\nTribal women selling minor for est pr oduce Leaf litter collection by women folk\nProject Tiger\nTiger is one of the key wildlife species in\nthe faunal web. In 1973, the authorities\nrealised that the tiger population had\ndwindled to 1,827 from an estimated\n55,000 at the turn of the century . The major\nthreats to tiger population are numerous,\nsuch as poaching for trade, shrinking\nhabitat, depletion of prey base species,\ngrowing human population, etc. The trade\nof tiger skins and the use of their bones in\ntraditional medicines, especially in the\nAsian countries left the tiger population on\nthe verge of extinction. Since India and\nNepal provide habitat to about two-thirds\nof the surviving tiger population in the\nworld, these two nations became prime\ntargets for poaching and illegal trading.\n“Project Tiger ”, one of the well-\npublicised wildlife campaigns in the world,\nwas launched in 1973.  Tiger conservation\nhas been viewed not only as an effort to\nsave an endangered species, but with\nReprint 2025-26\n\n15 FOREST AND WILDLIFE  RESOURCES\nmuch of its forest and wildlife resources are\neither owned or managed by the government\nthrough the For est Department or other\ngovernment departments. These are classified\nunder the following categories.\n(i)Reserved Forests:  More than half of the\ntotal forest land has been declared\nreserved forests . Reserved forests are\nregarded as the most valuable as far as the\nconservation of forest and wildlife resources\nare concerned.\n(ii)Protected Forests:  Almost one-third of the\ntotal forest area is protected forest, as\ndeclared by the Forest Department. This\nforest land are protected from any further\ndepletion.\n(iii)Unclassed Forests:  These are other\nforests and wastelands belonging to\nboth government and private individuals\nand communities.\nReserved and protected forests are also\nreferred to as permanent forest estates\nmaintained for the purpose of producing\ntimber and other forest produce, and for\nprotective reasons. Madhya Pradesh has the\nlargest area under permanent forests,\nconstituting 75 per cent of its total forest area.\nJammu and Kashmir , Andhra Pradesh,\nUttarakhand, Kerala, T amil Nadu, W est\nBengal, and Maharashtra have large\npercentages of reserved forests of its total forest\narea whereas Bihar , Haryana, Punjab,\nHimachal Pradesh, Odisha and Rajasthan have\na bulk of it under protected forests.

There is now a more intensive\nsearch for different conservation measures.\nIncreasingly, even insects are beginning to find\na place in conservation planning. In the\nnotification under Wildlife Act of 1980 and\n1986, several hundred butterflies, moths,\nbeetles, and one dragonfly have been added to\nthe list of protected species. In 1991, for the\nfirst time plants were also added to the list,\nstarting with six species.\nTypes and Distribution of Forest and\nWildlife Resources\nEven if we want to conserve our vast forest and\nwildlife resources, it is rather difficult to\nmanage, control and regulate them.

W e often ignor\ne that in India, forests\nare also home to some of the traditional\ncommunities. In some areas of India, local\ncommunities are struggling to conserve these\nhabitats along with gover nment of ficials,\nrecognising that only this will secure their\nown long-term livelihood. In Sariska Tiger\nReserve, Rajasthan, villagers have fought\nagainst mining by citing the Wildlife Protection\nAct. In many areas, villagers themselves are\nprotecting habitats and explicitly rejecting\ngovernment involvement. The inhabitants of\nfive villages in the Alwar district of Rajasthan\nhave declared 1,200 hectares of forest as the\nBhairodev Dakav ‘Sonchuri’, declaring their\nown set of rules and regulations which do not\nallow hunting, and are protecting the wildlife\nagainst any outside encroachments.\nThe famous Chipko  movement in the\nHimalayas has not only successfully resisted\ndeforestation in several areas but has also\nshown that community afforestation with\nindigenous species can be enormously\nsuccessful. Attempts to revive the traditional\nconservation methods or developing new\nmethods of ecological farming are now\nwidespr ead. Far mers and citizen’s gr oups like\nthe Beej Bachao Andolan\n in T ehri and\nNavdanya  have shown that adequate levels of\ndiversified crop production without the use of\nsynthetic chemicals are possible and\neconomically viable.\nIn India joint for est management (JFM)\nprogramme furnishes a good example for\ninvolving local communities in the\nmanagement and restoration of degradedCan you find out the reasons for the above mentioned problems?\nReprint 2025-26\n\n17 FOREST AND WILDLIFE  RESOURCES\nSacred groves - a wealth of diverse and rare\nspecies\nNature worship is an age old tribal belief based on\nthe premise that all creations of nature have to be\nprotected. Such beliefs have preserved several virgin\nforests in pristine form called Sacred Groves (the\nforests of God and Goddesses). These patches of\nforest or parts of large forests have been left\nuntouched by the local people and any interference\nwith them is banned.\nCertain societies revere a particular tree which\nthey have preserved from time immemorial. The\nMundas and the Santhal of Chota Nagpur region\nworship mahua ( Bassia latifolia ) and kadamba\n(Anthocaphalus cadamba ) trees, and the tribals of\nOdisha and Bihar worship the tamarind ( Tamarindus\nindica ) and mango ( Mangifera indica ) trees during\nweddings. T o many of us, peepal and banyan trees\nare considered sacred.\nIndian society comprises several cultures, each\nwith its own set of traditional methods of conserving\nnature and its creations. Sacred qualities are often\nascribed to springs, mountain peaks, plants and\nanimals which are closely protected. Y ou will find\ntroops of macaques and langurs around many\ntemples. They are fed daily and treated as a part of\ntemple devotees.

The programme has been in formal\nexistence since 1988 when the state of\nOdisha passed the first resolution for joint\nforest management. JFM depends on the\nformation of local (village) institutions that\nundertake protection activities mostly on\ndegraded forest land managed by the forest\ndepartment. In return, the members of\nthese communities are entitled to\nintermediary benefits like non-timber\nforest produces and share in the timber\nharvested by ‘successful protection’.\nThe clear lesson from the dynamics of\nboth environmental destruction and\nreconstruction in India is that local\ncommunities everywhere have to be\ninvolved in some kind of natural resource\nmanagement. But there is still a long way\nto go before local communities are at the\ncentre-stage in decision-making. Accept\nonly those economic or developmental\nactivities, that are people centric,\nenvironment-friendly and economically\nrewarding.\n“The tree is a peculiar organism of unlimited kindness and benevolence and\nmakes no demand for its sustenance, and extends generously the products of its\nlife activity . It affords protection to all beings, offering shade even to the axemen\nwho destroy it”.\nGautama Buddha (487 B.C.)\nWrite a short essay on any practices\nwhich you may have observed and\npractised in your everyday lives that\nconserve and protect the environment\naround you.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n",
