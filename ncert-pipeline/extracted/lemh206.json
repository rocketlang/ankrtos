Kantorovich\nReprint 2025-26\n\nLINEAR PROGRAMMING          395\n12.2  Linear Programming Problem and its Mathematical Formulation\nWe begin our discussion with the above example of furniture dealer which will further\nlead to a mathematical formulation of the problem in two variables. In this example, we\nobserve\n(i)The dealer can invest his money in buying tables or chairs or combination thereof.\nFurther he would earn different profits by following different investment\nstrategies.\n(ii) There are certain overriding conditions  or constraints viz., his investment is\nlimited to a maximum  of Rs 50,000 and so is his storage space which is for a\nmaximum of 60 pieces.\nSuppose he decides to buy tables only and no chairs, so he can buy 50000 ÷ 2500,\ni.e., 20 tables. His profit in this case will be Rs (250 × 20), i.e., Rs 5000.\nSuppose he chooses to buy chairs only and no tables. With his capital of  Rs 50,000,\nhe can buy 50000 ÷ 500, i.e. 100 chairs. But he can store only 60 pieces. Therefore, he\nis forced to buy only 60 chairs which will give him a total profit of Rs (60 × 75), i.e.,\nRs 4500 .\nThere are many other possibilities, for instance, he may choose to buy 10 tables\nand 50 chairs, as he can store only 60 pieces. Total profit in this case would be\nRs (10 × 250 + 50 × 75), i.e., Rs 6250  and so on.\nWe, thus, find that the dealer can invest his money in dif ferent ways and he would\nearn different profits by following different investment strategies.\nNow the problem is : How should he invest his money in order to get maximum\nprofit? To answer this question, let us try to formulate the problem mathematically .\n12.2.1 Mathematical formulation of the problem\nLet x be the number of tables and y be the number of chairs that the dealer buys.\nObviously , x and y must be non-negative, i.e.,\n0 ... (1)(Non-negative constraints)... (2) 0x\ny≥ \n ≥ \nThe dealer is constrained by the maximum amount he can invest (Here it is\nRs 50,000) and by the maximum number of items he can store (Here it is 60).\nStated mathematically ,\n2500 x + 500 y ≤50000 (investment constraint)\nor 5x + y ≤100 ... (3)\nand x + y ≤60  (storage constraint) ... (4)\nReprint 2025-26\n\n396 MATHEMA TICS\nThe dealer wants to invest in such a way so as to maximise his profit, say , Z which\nstated as a function of x and y is given by\nZ = 250 x + 75 y (called objective function ) ... (5)\nMathematically , the given problems now reduces to:\nMaximise Z = 250 x + 75 y\nsubject to the constraints:\n5x + y ≤100\nx + y ≤60\nx ≥ 0,  y ≥0\nSo, we have to maximise the linear function Z subject to certain conditions determined\nby a set of linear inequalities with variables as non-negative. There are also some other\nproblems where we have to minimise a linear function subject to certain conditions\ndetermined by a set of linear inequalities with variables as non-negative. Such problems\nare called Linear Programming Problems.\nThus, a Linear Programming Problem is one that is concerned with finding the\noptimal value (maximum or minimum value) of  a linear function (called  objective\nfunction ) of several variables (say x and y), subject to the conditions that the variables\nare non-negative and satisfy a set of linear inequalities (called  linear constraints).\nThe term linear  implies that all the mathematical relations used in the problem are\nlinear relations  while the term programming refers to the method of determining a\nparticular programme  or plan of action.\nBefore we proceed further , we now formally define some terms (which have been\nused above) which we shall be using in the linear programming problems:\nObjective function Linear function Z = ax + by, where a, b are constants, which has\nto be maximised or minimized is called a linear objective function.\nIn the above example, Z = 250 x + 75 y is a linear objective function. Variables x and\ny are called decision variables .\nConstraints The linear inequalities or equations or restrictions on the variables of a\nlinear programming problem are called constraints . The conditions x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 are\ncalled non-negative restrictions. In the above example, the set of inequalities (1) to (4)\nare constraints .\nOptimisation pr oblem  A problem which seeks to maximise or minimise a linear\nfunction (say of two variables x and y) subject to certain constraints as determined by\na set of linear inequalities is called an optimisation problem . Linear programming\nproblems are sp ecial type of optimisation problems. The above problem of investing a\nReprint 2025-26\n\nLINEAR PROGRAMMING          397\ngiven sum by the dealer in purchasing chairs and tables is an example of an optimisation\nproblem as well as of a linear programming problem.\nWe will now discuss how to find solutions to a linear programming problem. In this\nchapter , we will be concerned only with the graphical method.\n12.2.2  Graphical method of solving linear programming problems\nIn Class XI, we have learnt how to graph a system of linear inequalities involving two\nvariables x and y and to find its solutions graphically . Let us refer to the problem of\ninvestment in tables and chairs discussed in Section 12.2. We will now solve this problem\ngraphically .  Let us graph the constraints stated as linear inequalities:\n5x + y ≤100 ... (1)\nx + y ≤60 ... (2)\nx ≥0 ... (3)\ny ≥0 ... (4)\nThe graph of this system (shaded region) consists of the points common to all half\nplanes determined by the inequalities (1) to (4) (Fig 12.1). Each point in this region\nrepresents a feasible choice  open to the dealer for investing in tables and chairs. The\nregion, therefore, is called the feasible region  for the problem. Every point of this\nregion is called a feasible solution  to the pro blem. Thus, we have,\nFeasible region The common region determined by all the constraints including\nnon-negative c onstraints x, y ≥ 0 of a linear programming problem is called the feasible\nregion  (or solution region) for the problem. In Fig 12.1, the region OABC (shaded) is\nthe feasible region for the problem. The region other than feasible region is called an\ninfeasible region .\nFeasible solutions Points within and on the\nboundary of the feasible region represent\nfeasible solutions of the constraints. In\nFig 12.1, every point within and on the\nboundary of the feasible region OABC\nrepresents feasible solution to the problem.\nFor example, the point (10, 50) is a feasible\nsolution of the problem and so are the points\n(0, 60), (20, 0) etc.\nAny point outside the feasible region is\ncalled an  infeasible solution. For example,\nthe point (25, 40) is an infeasible solution of\nthe problem.Fig 12.1\nReprint 2025-26\n\n398 MATHEMA TICS\nOptimal (feasible) solution : Any point in the feasible region that gives the optimal\nvalue (maximum or minimum) of the objective function is called an optimal solution.\nNow, we see that every point in the feasible region OABC satisfies all the constraints\nas given in (1) to (4), and since there are infinitely many points , it is not evident how\nwe should go about finding a point that gives a maximum value of the objective function\nZ = 250 x + 75 y. To handle this situation, we use the following theorems which are\nfundamental in solving linear programming problems. The proofs of these theorems\nare beyond the scope of the book.\nTheorem 1  Let R be the feasible region (convex polygon) for a linear programming\nproblem and let Z = ax + by be the objective function. When Z has an optimal value\n(maximum or minimum), where the variables x and y are subject to constraints described\nby linear inequalities, this optimal value must occur at a corner point* (vertex) of the\nfeasible region.\nTheorem 2  Let R be the feasible region for a linear programming problem, and let\nZ = ax + by be the objective function.  If R is bounded** , then the objective function\nZ has both a maximum  and a minimum  value on R and each of these occurs at a\ncorner point (vertex) of R.\nRemark  If R is unbounded , then a maximum or a minimum value of the objective\nfunction may not exist. However , if it exists, it must occur at a corner point of R.\n(By Theorem 1).\nIn the above example, the corner points (vertices) of the bounded (feasible) region\nare: O, A, B and C and it is easy to find their coordinates as (0, 0), (20, 0), (10, 50) and\n(0, 60) respectively . Let us now compute the values of Z at these points.\nWe have\n* A corn er point of a feasible region is a point in the region which is the intersection of two boundary lines.\n** A feasible region of a system of linear inequalities is said to be bounded if it can be enclosed within a\ncircle. Otherwise, it is called unbounded. Unbounded means that the feasible region does extend\nindefinitely in any direction.Vertex of the Corresponding value\nFeasible Region of Z (in Rs)\nO (0,0) 0\nC (0,60) 4500\nB (10,50) 6250\nA (20,0)  5000Maximum ←\nReprint 2025-26\n\nLINEAR PROGRAMMING          399\nWe observe that the maximum profit to the dealer results from the investment\nstrategy (10, 50), i.e. buying 10 tables and 50 chairs.\nThis method of solving linear programming problem is referred as Corner Point\nMethod . The method comprises of the following steps:\n1.Find the feasible region of the linear programming problem and determine its\ncorner points (vertices) either by inspection or by solving the two equations of\nthe lines intersecting at that point.\n2.Evaluate the objective function Z = ax + by at each corner point. Let M and m,\nrespectively denote the largest and smallest values of these points.\n3.(i)When the feasible region is bounded , M and m are the maximum and\nminimum values of Z.\n(ii)In case, the feasible region is unbounded , we have:\n4.(a)M is the maximum value of Z, if the open half plane determined by\nax + by > M has no point in common with the feasible region. Otherwise, Z\nhas no maximum value.\n(b)Similarly , m is the minimum value of Z,  if the open half plane determined by\nax + by < m has no point in common with the feasible region. Otherwise, Z\nhas no minimum value.\nWe will now illustrate these steps of Corner Point Method by considering some\nexamples:\nExample 1  Solve the following linear programming problem graphically:\nMaximise Z = 4 x + y ... (1)\nsubject to the constraints:\nx + y ≤50 ... (2)\n3x + y ≤90 ... (3)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥0 ... (4)\nSolution  The shaded region in Fig 12.2 is the feasible region determined by the system\nof constraints (2) to (4). We observe that the feasible region OABC is  bounded.  So,\nwe now use Corner Point Method to determine the maximum value of Z.\nThe coordinates of the corner points O, A, B and C are (0, 0), (30, 0), (20, 30) and\n(0, 50) respectively . Now we evaluate Z at each corner point.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n400 MATHEMA TICS\nFig 12.2\nHence, maximum value of Z is 120 at the point (30, 0).\nExample 2  Solve the following linear programming problem graphically:\nMinimise Z = 200 x + 500 y ...

Now we evaluate Z  = 200 x + 500 y\nat these poin ts.\nHence, minimum value of Z is 2300 attained at the point (4, 3)\nExample 3  Solve the following problem graphically:\nMinimise and Maximise Z = 3 x + 9y ...

(5)\nSolution  First of all, let us graph the feasible region of the system of linear inequalities\n(2) to (5). The feasible region ABCD is shown in the Fig 12.4. Note that the region is\nbounded. The coordinates of the corner points A, B, C and D are (0, 10), (5, 5), (15,15)\nand (0, 20) respectively .\nFig 12.4Corner Corresponding value of\nPoint  Z = 3 x + 9y\nA (0, 10) 90\nB (5, 5) 60\nC (15, 15) 180\nD (0, 20) 180Minimum\nMaximum\n(Multiple\noptimal\nsolutions)←}←\nWe now find the minimum and maximum value of Z. From the table, we find that\nthe minimum value of Z is 60 at the point B (5, 5) of the feasible region.\nThe maximum value of Z on the feasible region occurs at the two corner points\nC (15, 15) and D (0, 20) and it is 180 in each case.\nRemark  Observe that in the above example, the  problem  has multiple optimal solutions\nat the corner points C and D, i.e. the both points produce same maximum value 180. In\nsuch cases, you can see that every point on the line segment CD joining the two corner\npoints C and D also give the same maximum value. Same is also true in the case if the\ntwo points produce same minimum value.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n402 MATHEMA TICS\nExample 4  Determine graphically the minimum value of the objective function\nZ =– 50x + 20 y ...

(5)\nSolution  First of all, let us graph the feasible region of the system of inequalities (2) to\n(5). The feasible region (shaded) is shown in the Fig 12.5. Observe that the feasible\nregion is unbounded .\nWe now evaluate Z at the corner points.\nFrom this table, we find that  – 300 is the smallest value of Z at the corner point\n(6, 0). Can we say that minimum value of Z is – 300? Note that if the region would\nhave been bounded, this smallest value of Z is the minimum value of Z (Theorem 2).\nBut here we see that the feasible region is unbounded. Therefore, – 300 may or may\nnot be the minimum value of Z. To decide this issue, we graph the inequality\n– 50x + 20 y < – 300 (see Step 3(ii) of corner Point Method.)\ni.e., – 5x + 2y <– 30\nand check whether the resulting open half plane has points in common with feasible\nregion or not. If it has common points, then –300 will not be the minimum value of Z.\nOtherwise, –300 will be the minimum value of Z.Fig 12.5Corner Point Z = – 50 x + 20 y\n(0, 5) 100\n(0, 3) 60\n(1, 0) –50\n(6, 0) –300 smallest←\nReprint 2025-26\n\nLINEAR PROGRAMMING          403\nAs shown in the Fig 12.5, it has common points. Therefore, Z = –50 x + 20 y\nhas no minimum value subject to the given constraints.\nIn the above example, can you say whether z = – 50 x + 20 y has the maximum\nvalue 100 at (0,5)? For this, check whether the graph of – 50 x + 20 y > 100 has points\nin common with the feasible region. (Why?)\nExample 5  Minimise Z = 3 x + 2y\nsubject to the constraints:\nx + y ≥8 ... (1)\n3x + 5y ≤15 ... (2)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥0 ... (3)\nSolution  Let us graph the inequalities (1) to (3) (Fig 12.6). Is there any feasible region?\nWhy is so?\nFrom Fig 12.6, you can see that\nthere is no point satisfying all the\nconstraints simultaneously . Thus, the\nproblem is having no feasible region and\nhence no feasible solution.\nRemarks  From the examples which we\nhave discussed so far , we notice some\ngeneral features of linear programming\nproblems:\n(i)The feasible region is always a\nconvex region.\n(ii)The maximum (or minimum)\nsolution of the objective function occurs at the vertex (corner) of the feasible\nregion. If two  corner points produce the same maximum (or minimum) value\nof the objective function , then every point on the line segment joining these\npoints will also give the same maximum (or minimum) value.\nEXERCISE 12.1\nSolve the following Linear Programming Problems graphically:\n1.Maximise Z =  3 x + 4y\nsubject to the constraints : x + y ≤ 4, x  ≥  0, y ≥ 0.Fig 12.6\nReprint 2025-26\n\n404 MATHEMA TICS\n2.Minimise Z = – 3 x + 4 y\nsubject to x + 2y ≤ 8, 3x + 2y ≤ 12,  x  ≥  0, y ≥ 0.\n3.Maximise Z = 5 x + 3y\nsubject to 3 x + 5y  ≤ 15, 5 x + 2y ≤ 10, x  ≥ 0, y ≥ 0.\n4.Minimise Z = 3 x + 5y\nsuch that x + 3y  ≥ 3, x + y  ≥ 2, x, y ≥ 0.\n5.Maximise Z = 3 x + 2y\nsubject to x + 2y ≤ 10, 3 x + y ≤ 15, x, y ≥ 0.\n6.Minimise Z = x + 2y\nsubject to 2\nx + y ≥ 3, x + 2y ≥ 6, x, y ≥ 0.\nShow that the minimum of Z occurs at more than two points.\n7.Minimise and Maximise Z = 5 x + 10 y\nsubject to x + 2y  ≤ 120, x + y ≥ 60, x – 2y  ≥ 0, x, y ≥ 0.\n8.Minimise and Maximise Z = x  + 2y\nsubject to x + 2y ≥ 100, 2 x – y ≤ 0, 2x + y ≤ 200; x, y ≥ 0.\n9.Maximise Z = – x + 2y, subject to the constraints:\nx ≥ 3, x + y ≥ 5, x + 2y ≥ 6, y ≥ 0.\n10.

Kantorovich and the American economist, F . L. Hitchcock,\nReprint 2025-26\n\nLINEAR PROGRAMMING          405\nboth of whom worked at it independently of each other . This was the well\nknown transpor tation pr oblem . In 1945, an English economist, G .Stigler ,\ndescribed yet another linear programming problem – that of determining an\noptimal diet .\nIn 1947, the American economist, G . B. Dantzig suggested an ef ficient method\nknown as the simplex method which is an iterative procedure to solve any\nlinear programming problem in a finite number of steps.\nL. Katorovich and American mathematical economist, T. C. Koopmans were\nawarded the nobel prize in the year 1975 in economics for their pioneering\nwork in linear programming. With the advent of computers and the necessary\nsoftwares, it has become possible to apply linear programming model to\nincreasingly complex problems in many areas.\n—/xrhombus/xrhombus/xrhombus/xrhombus/xrhombus—\nReprint 2025-26\n\n",
