It was\nbelieved that resources are free gifts of nature.\nAs a result, human beings used them\nindiscriminately and this has led to the\nfollowing major problems.\n•Depletion of resources for satisfying the\ngreed of a few individuals.\n•Accumulation of resources in few hands, which,\nin turn, divided the society into two segments\ni.e. haves  and have nots or rich and poor.\n•Indiscriminate exploitation of resources has\nled to global ecological crises such as, global\nwarming, ozone layer depletion, environmental\npollution and land degradatio n.\nAn equitable distribution of resources has\nbecome essential for a sustained quality of life\nand global peace. If the present trend of\nresource depletion by a few individuals and\ncountries continues, the future of our planet\nis in danger .\nTherefore, resource planning is essential for\nsustainable existence of all forms of life.\nSustainable existence is a component of\nsustainable development.\nSustainable development\nSustainable economic development means\n‘development should take place without\ndamaging the environment, and development\nin the present should not compromise with the\nneeds of the future generations.’\nRio de Janeiro Earth Summit, 1992\nIn June 1992, more than 100 heads of states\nmet in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, for the first\nInternational Earth Summit. The Summit was\nconvened for addressing urgent problems of\nenvironmental protection and socio-\neconomic development at the global level.\nThe assembled leaders signed the\nDeclaration on Global Climatic Change and\nBiological Diversity . The Rio Convention\nendorsed the global Forest Principles and\nadopted Agenda 21  for achieving\nSustainable Development in the 21st century .\nAgenda 21\nIt is the declaration signed by world leaders\nin 1992 at the United Nations Conference\non Environment and Development (UNCED),\nwhich took place at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It\naims at achieving global sustainable\ndevelopment. It is an agenda to combat\nenvironmental damage, poverty , disease\nthrough global co-operation on common\ninterests, mutual needs and shared\nresponsibilities. One major objective of the\nAgenda 21 is that every local government\nshould draw its own local Agenda 21.\nRESOURCE  PLANNING\nPlanning is the widely accepted strategy for\njudicious use of resources.

There are some regions which can\nbe considered self sufficient in terms of the\navailability of resources and there are some\nregions which have acute shortage of some vital\nresources. For example, the states of\nJharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Madhya\nPradesh are rich in minerals and coal deposits.\nArunachal Pradesh has abundance of water\nresources but lacks in infrastructural\ndevelopment. The state of Rajasthan is very well\nendowed with solar and wind energy but lacks\nin water resources. The cold desert of Ladakh\nis relatively isolated from the rest of the\ncountry. It has very rich cultural heritage but\nit is deficient in water , infrastructur e and some\nvital minerals. This calls for balanced resource\nplanning at the national, state, regional and\nlocal levels.technology and institutions may hinder\ndevelopment. There are many regions in our\ncountry that are rich in resources but these\nare included in economically backward\nregions. On the contrary there are some regions\nwhich have a poor resource base but they are\neconomically developed.\nCan you name some resource rich but\neconomically backward regions and some\nresource poor but economically developed\nregions? Give reasons for such a situation.\nThe history  of colonisation reveals that\nrich resources in colonies were the main\nattractions for the foreign invaders. It was\nprimarily the higher level of technological\ndevelopment of the colonising countries that\nhelped them to exploit resources of other\nregions and establish their supremacy over\nthe colonies. Therefore, resources can\ncontribute to development only when they are\naccompanied by appropriate technological\ndevelopment and institutional changes. India\nhas experienced all this in different phases of\ncolonisation. Therefore, in India, development,\nin general, and resource development in\nparticular does not only involve the\navailability of resources, but also the\ntechnology, quality of human resources and\nthe historical experiences of the people.\nConservation of Resources:  Resources are\nvital for any developmental activity. But\nirrational consumption and over -utilisation\nof resources may lead to socio-economic and\nenvironmental problems. To overcome these\nproblems, resource conservation at various\nlevels is important. This had been the main\nconcern of the leaders and thinkers in the\npast. For example, Gandhiji was very apt in\nvoicing his concern about resource\nconservation in these words : “There is enoughResource Planning in India\nResource planning is a complex process\nwhich involves : (i) identification and\ninventory of resources across the regions of\nthe country. This involves surveying,\nmapping and qualitative and quantitative\nestimation and measurement of the\nresources. (ii) Evolving a planning structure\nendowed with appropriate technology, skill\nand institutional set up for implementing\nresource development plans. (iii) Matching\nthe resource development plans with overall\nnational development plans.\nIndia has made concerted efforts for\nachieving the goals of resource planning right\nfrom the First Five Y ear Plan launched after\nIndependence.\nThe availability of resources is a necessary\ncondition for the development of any region,\nbut mere availability of resources in the\nabsence of corresponding changes in\nWhat resources are being developed in your\nsurroundings by the community/village\npanchayats/ward level communities with the\nhelp of community participation?\nPrepare a list of resources found in your state\nand also identify the resources that are\nimportant but deficit in your st ate.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n",

About 43 per cent of the land area\nis plain, which provides facilities for agriculture\nand industry. Mountains account for 30 per\ncent of the total surface area of the country and\nensure perennial flow of some rivers, provide\nfacilities for tourism and ecological aspects.\nAbout  27 per cent of the area of the country is\nthe plateau region. It possesses rich reserves\nof minerals, fossil fuels and forests.\nLAND UTILISATION\nLand resources are used for the following\npurposes:\n1.Forests\n2.Land not available for cultivation\n(a)Barren and waste land\n(b)Land put to non-agricultural uses, e.g.\nbuildings, roads, factories, etc.\n3.Other uncultivated land (excluding\nfallow land)\n(a)Permanent pastures and grazing land,\n(b)Land under miscellaneous tree crops\ngroves (not included in net  sown area),\n(c)Culturable waste land (left uncultivated\nfor more than 5 agricultural years).\n4.Fallow lands\n(a)Current fallow-(left without cultivation\nfor one or less than one agricultural year),\n(b)Other than current fallow-(left\nuncultivated for the past 1 to 5\nagricultural years).\n5.Net sown area– the physical extent of land\non which crops are sown harvested is\nknown as net sown area.\nArea sown more than once in an\nagricultural year plus net sown area is\nknown as gross cropped area .\nLAND USE PATTERN  IN INDIA\nThe use of land is determined both by physical\nfactors such as topography, climate, soil types\nas well as human factors such as population\ndensity, technological capability and culture\nand traditions etc.for everybody’s need and not for any body’s\ngreed.” He placed the greedy and selfish\nindividuals and exploitative nature of modern\ntechnology as the root cause for resource\ndepletion at the global level. He was against\nmass production and wanted to replace it with\nthe production by the masses.\nAt the international level, the Club of Rome\nadvocated resource conservation for the first\ntime in a more systematic way in 1968.\nSubsequently , in 1974, Gandhian philosophy\nwas once again presented by Schumacher\nin his book Small is Beautiful . The seminal\ncontribution with respect to resource\nconservation at the global level was made\nby the Brundtland Commission Report, 1987.\nThis report introduced the concept of\n‘Sustainable Development’ and advocated\nit as a means for resource conservation,\nwhich was subsequently published in a book\nentitled Our Common Future . Another\nsignificant contribution was made at the Earth\nSummit at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 1992.\nLAND RESOURCES\nWe live on land, we per form our economic\nactivities on land and we use it in different\nways. Thus, land is a natural resource of\nutmost importance. It supports natural\nvegetation, wild life, human life, economic\nactivities, transport and communication\nsystems.

W aste land\nincludes rocky, arid and d esert areas and land\nput to other non-agricultural uses includes\nsettlements, roads, railways, industry etc.\nContinuous use of land over a long period of\ntime without taking appropriate measures to\nconserve and manage it, has resulted in land\ndegradation. This, in turn, has serious\nrepercussions on society and the\nenvir onment.\nLAND DEGRADA TION AND CONSER VATION\nMEASURES\nWe have shar ed our land with the past\ngenerations and will have to do so with the future\ngenerations too. Ninety-five per cent of our basic\nneeds for food, shelter and clothing are obtained\nfrom land. Human activities have not only\nbrought about degradation of land but have\nalso aggravated the pace of natural forces to\ncause damage to land.\nSome human activities such as\ndeforestation, over grazing, mining and\nquarrying too have contributed significantly in\nland degradation.\nMining sites are abandoned after\nexcavation work is complete leaving deep\nscars and traces of over -burdening. In states\nlike Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Madhya\nPradesh and Odisha deforestation due to\nmining have caused severe land degradation.\nIn states like Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya\nPradesh and Maharashtra overgrazing is one\nof the main reasons for land degradation. In\nthe states of Punjab, Haryana, western Uttar\nPradesh, over irrigation is responsible for land\ndegradation due to water logging leading to\nincrease in salinity and alkalinity in the soil.\nThe mineral processing like grinding of\nlimestone for cement industry and calcite and\nsoapstone for ceramic industry generate huge\nquantity of dust in the atmosphere. It retards\nthe process of infiltration of water into the soil\nafter it settles down on the land. In recent\nyears, industrial effluents as waste have\nbecome a major source of land and water\npollution in many parts of the country.There are many ways to solve the problems\nof land degradation. Afforestation and proper\nmanagement of grazing can help to some extent.\nPlanting of shelter belts of plants, control on\nover grazing, stabilisation of sand dunes by\ngrowing thorny bushes are some of the\nmethods to check land degradation in arid\nareas. Proper management of waste lands,\ncontrol of mining activities, proper discharge\nand disposal of industrial ef fluents and wastes\nafter treatment can reduce land and water\ndegradation in industrial and suburban areas.\nSOIL AS A RESOURCE\nSoil is the most important renewable natural\nresour ce. It is the medium of plant gr owth\nand supports dif fer\nent types of living or ganisms\non the earth. The soil is a living system. It\ntakes  millions of years to form soil upto a few\ncm in depth.

These\nhave contributed in the development of various\ntypes of soils.\nAlluvial Soils\nThis is the most widely spread and important\nsoil. In fact, the entire northern plains are\nmade of alluvial soil. These have been\ndeposited by three important Himalayan river\nsystem s– the Indus, the Ganga and the\nBrahmaputra. These soils also extend in\nRajasthan and Gujarat thr ough a narr ow\ncorridor . Alluvial soil is also found in the\neastern coastal plains particularly in the deltas\nof the Mahanadi, the Godavari, the Krishna\nand the Kaveri rivers.nodules than the Khadar . It has mor e fine\nparticles and is mor e fertile than the bangar .\nAlluvial soils as a whole are very fertile.\nMostly these soils contain adequate proportion\nof potash, phosphoric acid and lime which\nare ideal for the growth of sugarcane, paddy,\nwheat and other cereal and pulse crops. Due\nto its high fertility, regions of alluvial soils are\nintensively cultivated and densely populated.\nSoils in the drier areas are more alkaline and\ncan be productive after proper treatment and\nirrigation.\nBlack Soil\nThese soils are black in colour and are also\nknown as regur  soils. Black soil is ideal for\ngrowing cotton and is also known as black\ncotton soil . It is believed that climatic condition\nalong with the parent rock material are the\nimportant factors for the formation of black\nsoil. This type of soil is typical of the Deccan\ntrap ( Basalt ) region spread over northwest\nDeccan plateau and is made up of lava flows.\nThey cover the plateaus of Maharashtra,\nSaurashtra, Malwa, Madhya Pradesh and\nChhattisgar h and extend in the south east\ndirection along the Godavari and the Krishna\nvalleys.\nFig. 1.6:   Alluvial Soil\nThe alluvial soil consists of various\nproportions of sand, silt and clay. As we move\ninlands towards the river valleys, soil particles\nappear some what bigger in size. In the upper\nreaches of the river valley i.e. near the place\nof the break of slope, the soils are coarse. Such\nsoils are more common in piedmont plains\nsuch as Duars, Chos  and Terai .\nApart from the size of their grains or\ncomponents, soils are also described on the\nbasis of their age. According to their age\nalluvial soils can be classified as old alluvial\n(Bangar ) and new alluvial ( Khadar ). The\nbangar  soil has higher concentration of kankerThe black soils are made up of extremely\nfine i.e. clayey material. They are well-known\nfor their capacity to hold moisture.

Y ellow\nand red soils are also found in parts of\nOdisha, Chhattisgar h, souther n parts of the\nmiddle Ganga plain and along the piedmont\nzone of the W estern Ghats. These soils develop\na reddish colour due to dif fusion of ir on in\ncrystalline and metamorphic r ocks. It looks\nyellow when it occurs in a hydrated form.\nLaterite Soil\nLaterite has been derived fr om the Latin word\n‘later’ which means brick. The laterite soil\ndevelops under tropical and subtropical\nclimate with alternate wet and dry season.\nThis soil is the result of intense leaching due\nto heavy rain. Lateritic soils ar e mostly deep\nto very deep, acidic (pH<6.0), generally\ndeficient in pla nt nutrients and occur mostly\nin souther n states, W ester n Ghats r egion of\nMaharashtra, Odisha, some parts of W est\nBengal and North-east regions. Where these\nsoils support deciduous and evergreen\nforests, it is humus rich, but under sparsevegetation and in semi-arid environment, it is\ngenerally humus poor . They ar e prone to\nerosion and degradation due to their position\non the landscape. After adopting appropriate\nsoil conservation techniques particularly in\nthe hilly areas of Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil\nNadu, this soil is very useful for growing tea\nand coffee. Red laterite soils in Tamil Nadu,\nAndhra Pradesh and Kerala are more suitable\nfor crops like cashew nut.\nArid Soils\nArid soils range fr om red to br own in colour .\nThey are generally sandy in texture and saline\nin nature.  In some areas the salt content is\nvery high and common salt is obtained by\nevaporating the water. Due to the dry climate,\nhigh temperature, evaporation is faster and\nthe soil lacks humus and moisture. The lower\nhorizons of the soil are occupied by Kankar\nbecause of the increasing calcium content\ndownwards. The Kankar  layer formations in\nthe bottom horizons restrict the infiltration of\nwater . After pr oper irrigation these soils\nbecome cultivable as has been in the case of\nwestern Rajasthan .\nFig. 1.8:   Laterite SoilForest Soils\nThese soils  are found in the hilly and\nmountainous areas where sufficient rain\nforests are available.

The soils found in the lower parts of\nthe valleys particularly on the river terraces\nand alluvial fans are fertile.\nSoil Erosion and Soil Conservation\nThe denudation of the soil cover and\nsubsequent washing down is described as soil\nerosion. The processes of soil formation and\nerosion, go on simultaneously and generally\nthere is a balance between the two. Sometimes,\nthis balance is disturbed due to human\nactivities like defor estation, over -grazing,\nconstruction and mining etc., while natural\nforces like wind, glacier and water lead to\nsoil erosion. The running water cuts through\nthe clayey soils and makes deep channels as\ngullies . The land becomes unfit for cultivation\nand is known as \nbad land . In the Chambal\nbasin such lands are called ravines.\nSometimes water flows as a sheet over large\nareas down a slope. In such cases the top\nFig. 1.11:  Gully Erosion\nsoil is washed away. This is known as sheet\nerosion . Wind blows loose soil of f flat or\nsloping land known as wind erosion. Soil\nerosion is also caused due to defective methods\nof farming. Ploughing in a wrong way i.e. up\nand down the slope form channels for the\nquick flow of water leading to soil erosion.\nPloughing along the contour lines can\ndecelerate the flow of water down the slopes.\nThis is called contour ploughing. Steps can\nbe cut out on the slopes making terraces.\nTerrace cultivation r estricts er osion. W ester n\nand central Himalayas have well developed\nterrace farming. Large fields can be divided into\nstrips. Strips of grass are left to grow between\nthe crops. This breaks up the force of the wind.\nThis method is known as strip cropping.\nPlanting lines of trees to create shelter also\nworks in a similar way. Rows of such trees are\ncalled shelter belts.
