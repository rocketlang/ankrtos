Since A, B and cos θ are\nscalars, the dot product of A and B is a scalar\nquantity. Each vector , A and B, has a dir ection\nbut their scalar product does not have a\ndirection.\nFrom Eq. (5.1a), we have\nA.B  = A (B cos θ )\n       = B (A cos θ )\nGeometrically, B cos θ is the projection of B onto\nA in Fig.5.1 (b) and A cos θ  is the projection of A\nonto B in Fig. 5.1 (c). So, A.B is the product of\nthe magnitude of A and the component of B along\nA. Alternatively, it is the product of the\nmagnitude of B and the component of A along B.\nEquation (5.1a) shows that the scalar product\nfollows the commutative law :\nA.B = B.A\nScalar product obeys the distributive\nlaw:\nA. (B + C ) = A.B + A.C\nFurther ,A.

Consider\na drop of mass 1.00 g falling from a height\n1.00 km.  It hits the ground with a speed of\n50.0 m s-1.  (a) What is the work done by the\ngravitational force ?

Consider a\nconstant for ce F acting on an object of mass m.\nThe object undergoes a displacement d in the\npositive x-direction as shown in Fig. 5.2.\nFig. 5.2 An object undergoes a displacement d\nunder the influence of the for ce F.5.2 NOTIONS OF WORK AND KINETIC\nENERGY: THE WORK-ENERGY THEOREM\nThe following relation for rectilinear motion under\nconstant acceleration a has been encountered\nin Chapter 3,\n      v2 − u2 = 2 as (5.2)\nwhere u and v  are the initial and final speeds\nand \ns the distance traversed.  Multiplying both\nsides by m/2, we have\n2 2 1 1\n2 2mv mu mas Fs− = = (5.2a)\nwhere the last step follows from Newton’s Second\nLaw. W e can generalise Eq. (5.2) to thr ee\ndimensions by employing vectors\nv2 − u2 = 2 a.d\nHere a and d are acceleration and displacement\nvectors of the object respectively.\nOnce again multiplying both sides by m/2 , we obtain\n2 2 1 1\n2 2mv mu m − = = a.d F.d (5.2b)\nThe above equation provides a motivation for\nthe definitions of work and kinetic energy. The\nleft side of the equation is the difference in the\nquantity ‘half the mass times the square of the\nspeed’ fr om its initial value to its final value. W e\ncall each of these quantities the ‘kinetic energy’,\ndenoted by K. The right side is a product of the\ndisplacement and the component of the force\nalong the displacement.  This quantity is called\n‘work’ and is denoted by W.  Eq. (5.2b) is then\nKf −  Ki = W (5.3)\nwhere Ki  and Kf  are respectively the initial and\nfinal kinetic energies of the object. W ork r efers\nto the force and the displacement over which it\nacts. Work is done by a for ce on the body over\na certain displacement .\nEquation (5.2) is also a special case of the\nwork-energy (WE) theorem : The change in\nkinetic energy of a particle is equal to the\nwork done on it by the net for ce. We shall\ngeneralise the above derivation to a varying force\nin a later section.\nExample 5.2   It is well known that a\nraindrop falls under the influence of the\ndownward gravitational force and the\nopposing resistive force.  The latter is known\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPHYSICS 74⊳Table 5.1   Alter native Units of W ork/Ener gy in J\nExample 5.3   A cyclist comes to a skidding\nstop in 10 m.  During this process, the force\non the cycle due to the road is 200 N and\nis directly opposed to the motion.  (a) How\nmuch work does the road do on the cycle ?\n(b) How much work does the cycle do on\nthe road ?\nAnswer  Work done on the cycle by the r oad is\nthe work done by the stopping (frictional) force\non the cycle due to the road.\n(a) The stopping force and the displacement make\nan angle of 180o  (π rad) with each other .\nThus, work done by the road,\nWr =  Fd cosθ\n     =  200 ×  10 × cos π\n      = – 2000 J\nIt is this negative work that brings the cycle\nto a halt in accordance with WE theorem.\n(b) From Newton’s Third Law an equal and\nopposite force acts on the road due to the\ncycle. Its magnitude is 200 N. However , the\nroad undergoes no displacement.  Thus,\nwork done by cycle on the road is zero.            ⊳\nThe lesson of Example 5.3 is that though the\nforce on a body A exerted by the body B is always\nequal and opposite to that on B by A (Newton’s\nThird Law); the work done on A by B is not\nnecessarily equal and opposite to the work done\non B by A.\n5.4  KINETIC ENERGY\nAs noted earlier , if an object of mass m has\nvelocity v, its kinetic energy K  is\n2K m mv1 1= =2 2v v.                        (5.5)\nKinetic  energy is a scalar quantity. The kinetic\nenergy of an object is a measure of the work anThe work done by the force is defined to be\nthe product of component of the force in the\ndirection of the displacement and the\nmagnitude of this displacement .  Thus\nW = (F cos θ )d = F.d (5.4)\nWe see that if ther e is no displacement, ther e\nis no work done even if the force is large.  Thus,\nwhen you push hard against a rigid brick wall,\nthe for ce you exert on the wall does no work.  Y et\nyour muscles are alternatively contracting and\nrelaxing and internal energy is being used up\nand you do get tired.  Thus, the meaning of work\nin physics is different from its usage in everyday\nlanguage.\nNo work is done if :\n(i)the displacement is zero as seen in the\nexample above. A weightlifter holding a 150\nkg mass steadily on his shoulder for 30 s\ndoes no work on the load during this time.\n(ii)the force is zero.  A block moving on a smooth\nhorizontal table is not acted upon by a\nhorizontal force (since there is no friction), but\nmay undergo a large displacement .\n(iii)the force and displacement are mutually\nperpendicular . This is so since, for θ = π/2 rad\n(= 90o), cos (π/2) = 0.  For the block moving on\na smooth horizontal table, the gravitational\nforce mg  does no work since it acts at right\nangles to the displacement. If we assume that\nthe moon’s orbits around the earth is\nperfectly circular then the earth’s\ngravitational force does no work.  The moon’s\ninstantaneous displacement is tangential\nwhile the earth’s force is radially inwards and\nθ  = π/2.\nWork can be both positive and negative.  If θ  is\nbetween 0o and 90o, cos θ  in Eq. (5.4) is positive.\nIf  θ  is  between 90o and 180o,   cos θ  is negative.\nIn many examples the frictional force opposes\ndisplacement and θ  = 180o. Then the work done\nby friction is negative (cos 180o = –1).\nFrom Eq. (5.4) it is clear that  work and energy\nhave the same dimensions,  [ML2T–2]. The SI unit\nof these is joule (J), named after the famous British\nphysicist James Prescott Joule  (1811-1869). Since\nwork and energy are so widely used as physical\nconcepts, alternative units abound and some of\nthese are listed in Table 5.1.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nWORK, ENERGY AND POWER 75⊳object can do by the virtue of its motion. This\nnotion has been intuitively known for a long time.\nThe kinetic energy of a fast flowing stream\nhas been used to grind corn. Sailing\nships employ the kinetic energy of the wind.  Table\n5.2 lists the kinetic energies for various\nobjects.\nExample 5.4  In a ballistics demonstration\na police officer fires a bullet of mass 50.0 g\nwith speed 200 m s-1 (see Table 5.2) on soft\nplywood of thickness 2.00 cm.  The bullet\nemerges with only 10% of its initial kinetic\nenergy.  What is the emergent speed of the\nbullet ?\nAnswer   The initial kinetic ener gy of the bullet\nis mv2/2 = 1000 J.  It has a final kinetic ener gy\nof 0.1×1000 = 100 J.  If vf  is the emer gent speed\nof the bullet,\n1\n2= mvf2100 J\nkg  05 . 0 J  100 2×=fv\n                =  63.2 m s–1\nThe speed is reduced by approximately 68%\n(not 90%) .                                                                      ⊳\n5.5  WORK DONE BY A V ARIABLE FORCE\nA constant force is rare.  It is the variable force,\nwhich is more commonly encountered.  Fig. 5.3\nis a plot of a varying force in one dimension.\nIf the displacement \n∆x is small, we can take\nthe force F(x)  as approximately constant and\nthe work done is then\n∆W =F(x) ∆xTable 5.2  Typical kinetic energies ( K)\nThis is illustrated in Fig. 5.3(a).  Adding\nsuccessive rectangular areas in Fig. 5.3(a) we\nget the total work done as\n( )∑∆ ≅f\nix\nxx x F W (5.6)\nwhere the summation is from the initial position\nxi  to the final position xf.\nIf the displacements are allowed to approach\nzero, then the number of terms in the sum\nincreases without limit, but the sum approaches\na definite value equal to the area under the curve\nin Fig. 5.3(b). Then the work done is\n          =()∫F x x\nxx\nif\nd(5.7)\nwhere ‘ lim’ stands for the limit of the sum when\n∆x  tends to zero.  Thus, for a varying force\nthe work done can be expressed as a definite\nintegral of force over displacement (see also\nAppendix 3.1).lim W =lim\nx∆→( )∑∆f\nix\nxx x F0\nFig. 5.3(a)\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPHYSICS 76⊳Fig. 5. 3(a) The shaded rectangle represents the\nwork done by the varying force F( x), over\nthe small displacement ∆ x,  ∆W = F(x) ∆x.\n(b) adding the areas of all the rectangles we\nfind that for ∆x → 0, the area under the curve\nis exactly equal to the work done by F( x).\nExample 5.5  A woman pushes a trunk on\na railway platform which has a rough\nsurface.  She applies a force of 100 N over a\ndistance of 10 m.  Ther eafter , she gets\nprogressively tired and her applied force\nreduces linearly with distance to 50 N.  The\ntotal distance through which the trunk has\nbeen moved is 20 m.  Plot the force applied\nby the woman and the frictional force, which\nis 50 N versus displacement.  Calculate the\nwork done by the two forces over 20 m.\nAnswer\nFig. 5.4 Plot of the force F applied by the woman and\nthe opposing frictional force f  versus\ndisplacement .\nThe plot of the applied force is shown in Fig.\n5.4.  At x   = 20 m, F   = 50 N (≠  0).  W e are given\nthat the frictional force f is |f|= 50 N. It opposes\nmotion and acts in a dir ection opposite to F.  It\nis therefore, shown on the negative side of the\nforce axis.\nThe work done by the woman is\nWF → area of the rectangle ABCD + area of\nthe trapezium CEID\n( ) WF= × + + ×100 101\n2100 50 10\n       = 1000 + 750\n      = 1750 JThe work done by the frictional force is\nWf → area of the rectangle AGHI\nWf  = (−50) × 20\n      = − 1000 J\nThe area on the negative side of the force axis\nhas a negative sign. ⊳\n5.6THE WORK-ENERGY THEOREM FOR A\nVARIABLE FORCE\nWe are now familiar with the concepts of work\nand kinetic energy to prove the work-energy\ntheor em for a variable for ce.  W e confine\nourselves to one dimension. The time rate of\nchange of kinetic energy is\nd\ndd\ndK\nt tm v=\n\n1\n22\n      d\ndvm vt=\n      v  F= (from Newton’s Second Law)\n      d\ndxFt=\nThus\n             dK = F dx\nIntegrating fr om the initial position  ( x i ) to final\nposition ( x f ), we have\nd dK F x\nKK\nxx\nif\nif\n∫ ∫=\nwhere,  Ki  and K f  are the initial and final kinetic\nenergies corr esponding to x i  and  x f.\norK K F xf i\nxx\nif\n− =∫d (5.8a)\nFrom Eq. (5.7), it follows that\n           Kf −  Ki  = W (5.8b)\nThus, the WE theorem is proved for a variable\nforce.\nWhile the WE theorem is useful in a variety of\nproblems, it does not, in general, incorporate the\ncomplete dynamical information of Newton’s\nsecond law. It is an integral form of Newton’s\nsecond law. Newton’s second law is a relation\nbetween acceleration and force at any instant of\ntime. W ork-ener gy theor em involves an integral\nover an interval of time. In this sense, the temporal\n(time) information contained in the statement of\nNewton’s second law is ‘integrated over’ and is\nReprint 2025-26\n\nWORK, ENERGY AND POWER 77⊳not available explicitly. Another observation is that\nNewton’s second law for two or three dimensions\nis in vector form whereas the work-energy\ntheorem is in scalar form. In the scalar form,\ninformation with respect to directions contained\nin Newton’s second law is not present.\nExample 5.6   A block of mass m  = 1 kg,\nmoving on a horizontal sur face with speed\nvi = 2 m s–1 enters a rough patch ranging\nfrom x = 0.10 m to x = 2.01 m. The retarding\nforce Fr on the block in this range is inversely\nproportional  to x  over this range,\nFk\nxr=− for 0.1 < x < 2.01 m\n= 0 for x < 0.1m and x > 2.01 m\nwhere k = 0.5 J.  What is the final kinetic\nenergy and speed vf  of the block as it\ncrosses this patch ?\nAnswer   From Eq.

The term potential energy\nbrings to one’s mind ‘stored’ energy. A stretched\nbow-string possesses potential energy. When it\nis released, the arrow flies off at a great speed.\nThe earth’s crust is not uniform, but has\ndiscontinuities and dislocations that are called\nfault lines. These fault lines in the earth’s crustare like ‘compressed springs’. They possess a\nlarge amount of potential energy. An earthquake\nresults when these fault lines readjust. Thus,\npotential energy is the ‘stored energy’ by virtue\nof the position or configuration of a body. The\nbody left to itself releases this stored energy in\nthe form of kinetic energy. Let us make our notion\nof potential energy more concrete.\nThe gravitational force on a ball of mass m is\nmg . g may be treated as a constant near the earth\nsurface. By ‘near’ we imply that the height h  of\nthe ball above the earth’s surface is very small\ncompared to the earth’s radius RE (h <<RE) so that\nwe can ignore the variation of g near the earth’s\nsurface *. In what follows we have taken the\nupward direction to be positive. Let us raise the\nball up to a height h. The work done by the external\nagency against the gravitational force is mgh. This\nwork gets stored as potential energy.\nGravitational potential energy of an object, as a\nfunction of the height h, is denoted by V(h) and it\nis the negative of work done by the gravitational\nforce in raising the object to that hei ght.\nV (h) = mgh\nIf h is taken as a variable, it is easily seen that\nthe gravitational for ce F equals the negative of\nthe derivative of V(h) with respect to h. Thus,\nd\ndF V(h) m gh= − = −\nThe negative sign indicates that the\ngravitational force is downward. When released,\nthe ball comes down with an increasing speed.\nJust before it hits the ground, its speed is given\nby the kinematic relation,\nv2 = 2gh\nThis equation can be written as\n21\nm v2 = m g h\nwhich shows that the gravitational potential\nenergy of the object at height h, when the object\nis released, manifests itself as kinetic energy of\nthe object on reaching the ground.\nPhysically, the notion of potential energy is\napplicable only to the class of forces where work\ndone against the force gets ‘stored up’ as energy.\nWhen external constraints are removed, it\nmanifests itself as kinetic energy. Mathematically,\n(for simplicity, in one dimension) the potential\n*The variation of g with height is discussed in ",

In the previous chapter we have worked\non examples dealing with inclined planes. If an\nobject of mass m is released from rest, from the\ntop of a smooth (frictionless) inclined plane of\nheight h, its speed at the bottom\nis gh2irrespective of the angle of inclination.\nThus, at the bottom of the inclined plane it\nacquires a kinetic energy, mgh . If the work done\nor the kinetic energy did depend on other factors\nsuch as the velocity or the particular path taken\nby the object, the force would be called non-\nconservative.\nThe  dimensions  of  potential  energy are\n[ML2T –2] and the unit is joule (J), the same as\nkinetic energy or work. To reiterate, the change\nin potential energy, for a conservative force,\n∆V  is equal to the negative of the work done by\nthe force\n∆V = − F(x) ∆x (5.9)\nIn the example of the falling ball considered in\nthis section we saw how potential energy was\nconverted to kinetic energy. This hints at an\nimportant principle of conservation in mechanics,\nwhich we now proceed to examine.\n5.8THE CONSER VATION OF MECHANICAL\nENERGY\nFor simplicity we demonstrate this important\nprinciple for one-dimensional motion. Suppose\nthat a body undergoes displacement ∆x under\nthe action of a conservative for ce F. Then fr om\nthe WE theorem we have,\n∆K =  F (x) ∆x\nIf the force is conservative, the potential energy\nfunction V(x) can be defined such that\n− ∆V  =  F( x) ∆x\nThe above equations imply that\n∆K + ∆V = 0\n∆(K + V ) = 0 (5.10)which means that K + V , the sum of the kinetic\nand potential energies of the body is a constant.\nOver the whole path,  \nxi to xf, this means that\nKi + V(xi) = Kf  + V(xf) (5.11)\nThe quantity K +V(x), is called the total\nmechanical energy of the system.  Individually\nthe kinetic energy K  and the potential energy\nV(x) may vary from point to point,  but the sum\nis a constant. The aptness of the term\n‘conservative for ce’ is now clear .\nLet us consider some of  the definitions of a\nconservative force.\nlA force F(x) is conservative if it can be derived\nfrom a scalar quantity V(x) by the relation\ngiven by Eq. (5.9). The three-dimensional\ngeneralisation requires the use of a vector\nderivative, which is outside the scope of this\nbook.\nlThe work done by the conservative for ce\ndepends only on the end points. This can be\nseen fr om the r elation,\nW = Kf – Ki = V (xi) – V(xf)\nwhich depends on the end points.\nlA thir d definition states that the work done\nby this force in a closed path is zer o.  This is\nonce  again apparent from Eq. (5.11) since\nxi  = xf .\nThus, the principle of conservation of total\nmechanical energy can be stated as\nThe total mechanical energy of a system is\nconserved if the forces, doing work on it, are\nconservative .\nThe above discussion can be made more\nconcrete by considering the example of the\ngravitational force once again and that of the\nspring force in the next section.

Hence, the mechanical\nenergy is conserved.  Thus\nEH = E0\nor,1\n22\nf mgH mv=\n2fv gH=\na result that was obtained in section 5.7 for a\nfreely falling body.\nFurther ,\nEH = Eh\nwhich implies,\nv g(H h)h22= −               (5.11 d)\nand is a familiar result from kinematics.\nAt the height H, the energy is purely potential.\nIt is partially converted to kinetic at height h  and\nis fully kinetic at ground level. This illustrates\nthe conservation of mechanical ener gy.\nExample 5. 7  A bob of mass m is suspended\nby a light string of length L .  It is imparted a\nhorizontal velocity vo at the lowest point A\nsuch that it completes a semi-circular\ntrajectory in the vertical plane with the string\nbecoming slack only on reaching the topmost\npoint, C.  This is shown in Fig. 5.6 . Obtain an\nexpression for (i) vo; (ii)  the speeds at points\nB and C; (iii) the ratio  of  the kinetic energies\n(KB/KC) at B and C. Comment on the nature\nof the trajectory of the bob after it reaches\nthe point C.\nFig. 5.6Answer  (i)  There are two external forces on\nthe bob : gravity and the tension ( T) in the\nstring. The latter does no work since the\ndisplacement of the bob is always normal to the\nstring. The potential energy of the bob is thus\nassociated with the gravitational force only. The\ntotal mechanical energy E  of the system is\nconserved.  W e take the potential ener gy of the\nsystem to be zero at the lowest point A. Thus,\nat A :\nE mv02=1\n2(5.12)\n       [Newton’s Second Law]\nwhere TA is the tension  in the string at A.

If\nthe connecting string is cut at this instant, the\nbob will execute a projectile motion with\nhorizontal projection akin to a rock kicked\nhorizontally from the edge of a cliff.  Otherwise\nthe bob will continue on its cir cular path and\ncomplete the revolution.              ⊳\n5.9  THE POTENTIAL ENERGY OF A SPRING\nThe spring force is an example of a variable force\nwhich is conservative. Fig. 5.7 shows a block\nattached to a spring and resting on a smooth\nhorizontal surface.  The other end of the spring\nis attached to a rigid wall. The spring is light\nand may be tr eated as massless.  In an ideal\nspring, the spring for ce Fs  is pr oportional to\nxwhere x  is the displacement of the block from\nthe equilibrium position. The displacement could\nbe either positive [Fig. 5.7(b)] or negative\n[Fig. 5.7(c)].  This force law for the spring is called\nHooke’s law and is mathematically stated as\nFs =  − kx\nThe constant k is called the spring constant.  Its\nunit is N m-1.  The spring is said to be stiff if k\n is\nlarge and soft if k is small.\nSuppose that we pull the block outwards as in\nFig. 5. 7(b). If the extension is xm, the work done by\nthe spring force is\nW F  xs s\n0xm\n=∫d    = −∫kx x\n0xm\nd\n22\nmx  k− =     (5.15)\nThis expression may also be obtained by\nconsidering the area of the triangle as in\nFig. 5.7(d).  Note that the work don e by the\nexternal pulling force F is positive since it\novercomes the spring force.22\nmx  kW+ = (5.16)\nFig. 5.7 Illustration of the spring force with a block\nattached to the free end of the spring.\n(a) The spring force Fs is zero when the\ndisplacement x  from the equilibrium position\nis zer o. (b) For the str etched spring x > 0\nand Fs  < 0 (c) For the compressed spring\nx < 0 and   Fs > 0.(d) The plot of Fs  versus x.\nThe area of the shaded triangle represents\nthe work done by the spring force. Due to the\nopposing signs of Fs and x, this work done is\nnegative, W kx /s m2= − 2.\nThe same is true when the spring is\ncompressed with a displacement xc (< 0).  The\nspring force does work 2 /  2\nc s kx W− =  while the\nReprint 2025-26\n\nWORK, ENERGY AND POWER 81\nFig. 5.8 Parabolic plots of the potential energy V and\nkinetic ener gy K of a block attached to a\nspring obeying Hooke’s law. The two plots\nare complementary, one decr easing as the\nother incr eases. The total mechanical\nenergy E = K + V remains constant.⊳external force F does work + kxc2/ 2. If the block\nis moved from an initial displacement xi  to a\nfinal displacement xf , the work done by the\nspring force Ws is\n  W k x x k x k x\ns\nxx\ni f\nif\n= − = − ∫d   \n  2 2\n2 2           (5.17)\nThus the work done by the spring force depends\nonly on the end points.  Specifically, if the block\nis pulled from xi  and allowed to return to xi ;\n      W k x x       k x k x si i\nxx\nii\n= − = − ∫d     2 2\n2 2\n       = 0 (5.18)\nThe work done by the spring force in a cyclic\nprocess is zer o.  We have explicitly demonstrated\nthat the spring force (i) is position dependent\nonly as first stated by Hooke, ( Fs = − kx); (ii)\ndoes work which only depends on the initial and\nfinal positions, e.g. Eq. (5.17).  Thus, the spring\nfor\nce is a conservative for ce.\nWe define the potential ener gy V(x) of the spring\nto be zero when block and spring system is in the\nequilibrium position.  For an extension (or\ncompression) x  the above analysis suggests that\nV(x)kx2\n=2(5.19)\nYou may easily verify that − dV/dx = −k x, the\nspring force.  If the block of mass m in Fig. 5. 7 is\nextended to xm and r eleased fr om rest, then its\ntotal mechanical energy at any arbitrary point x,\nwhere x lies between – xm  and + xm, will be given by\n2 2 2\nm v  m x  k x  k21\n21\n21+ =\nwhere we have invoked the conservation of\nmechanical energy.  This suggests that the speed\nand the kinetic ener gy will be maximum at the\nequilibrium position, x = 0, i.e.,\n2\nm2\nm x  k   v  m21\n21=\nwhere vm is the maximum speed.\nor m m x  mkv=\nNote that k/m  has the dimensions of [T-2] and\nour equation is dimensionally correct. The\nkinetic energy gets converted to potential energyand vice versa, however, the total mechanical\nenergy remains constant. This is graphically\ndepicted in Fig. 5.8.\nExample 5. 8  To simulate car accidents, auto\nmanufacturers study the collisions of moving\ncars with mounted springs of different spring\nconstants.  Consider a typical simulation with\na car of mass 1000 kg moving with a speed\n18.0 km/h on a smooth road and colliding\nwith a horizontally mounted spring of spring\nconstant 5.25  × 103 N m–1. What is the\nmaximum compression of the spring  ?\nAnswer    At maximum compression the kinetic\nenergy of the car is converted entirely into the\npotential energy of the spring.\nThe kinetic ener gy of the moving car is\nK mv2=1\n2\n    5 5 1021 3× × × =\n            K  = 1.25 × 104 J\nwhere we have converted 18 km h–1 to 5 m s–1  [It is\nuseful to remember that 36 km h–1 = 10 m s–1].\nAt maximum compression xm, the potential\nenergy V of the spring is equal to the kinetic\nenergy K  of the moving car from the principle of\nconservation of mechanical energy.\n2\nmx  k   V21=\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPHYSICS 82⊳                = 1.25 × 104 J\nWe obtain\nxm = 2.00 m\nWe note that we have idealised the situation.\nThe spring is considered to be massless. The\nsurface has been considered to possess\nnegligible friction. ⊳\nWe conclude this section by making a few\nremarks on conservative forces.\n(i)Information on time is absent from the above\ndiscussions. In the example considered\nabove, we can calculate the compression, but\nnot the time over which the compression\noccurs.  A solution of Newton’s Second Law\nfor this system is required for temporal\ninformation.\n(ii)Not all forces are conservative. Friction, for\nexample, is a non-conservative force. The\nprinciple of conservation of energy will have\nto be modified in this case. This is illustrated\nin Example 5.9.\n(iii)The zero of the potential energy is arbitrary.\nIt is set according to convenience.  For the\nspring force we took V(x) = 0, at  x = 0, i.e. the\nunstretched spring had zero potential\nenergy.  For the constant gravitational force\nmg, we took V = \n0  on the earth’s surface.  In\na later chapter we shall see that for the force\ndue to the universal law of gravitation, the\nzero is best defined at an infinite distance\nfrom the gravitational sour ce. However , once\nthe zero of the potential energy is fixed in a\ngiven discussion, it must be consistently\nadher ed to thr oughout the discussion. Y ou\ncannot change horses in midstream !\nExample 5. 9   Consider Example 5. 8 taking\nthe coefficient of friction, µ, to be 0.5 and\ncalculate the  maximum compression of the\nspring.\nAnswer  In presence of friction, both the spring\nforce and the frictional force act so as to oppose\nthe compression of the spring as shown in\nFig. 5.9.\nWe invoke the work-energy theor em, rather\nthan the conservation of mechanical energy.\nThe change in kinetic energy isFig. 5.9  The forces acting on the car .\n∆K  = Kf − Ki 2v  m    210− =\nThe work done by the net force is\n1\n22\nm m W   kx   m g x= − −µ\nEquating we have\n1 1\n2 22 2\nm m m v   k x  m g x= +µ\nNow  µmg  = 0.5 × 103 × 10 = 5 × 103 N (taking\ng =10.0 m s-2). After rearranging the above\nequatio n we obtain the following quadratic\nequation in the unknown xm.\n22 2\nm m k x m g x m v 0+ − =µ\nwhere we take the positive square root since\nxm is positive. Putting in numerical values we\nobtain\nxm  = 1.35 m\nwhich, as expected, is less than the result in\nExample 5.8.\nIf the two forces on the body consist of a\nconservative force Fc and a non-conservative\nforce  Fnc , the conservation of mechanical energy\nformula will have to be modified. By the WE\ntheorem\n(Fc+ Fnc) ∆x = ∆K\nBut     Fc ∆x = − ∆V\nHence,             ∆(K + V ) = Fnc ∆x\n                       ∆E    = Fnc ∆x\nwhere E  is the total mechanical energy. Over\nthe path this assumes the form\nEf −−−\n−− Ei  = Wnc\nwhere Wnc  is the total work done by the\nnon-conservative forces over the path. Note that\nReprint 2025-26\n\nWORK, ENERGY AND POWER 83\nOur electricity bills carry the energy\nconsumption in units of kWh.  Note that kWh is\na unit of ener gy and not of power .\nExample 5.10   An elevator can carry a\nmaximum load of 1800 kg (elevator +\npassengers) is moving up with a constant\nspeed of 2 m s–1. The frictional force opposing\nthe motion  is 4000 N. Determine the\nminimum power delivered by the motor to\nthe elevator in watts as well as in horse\npower .\nAnswer  The downward force on the elevator is\nF = m g  + Ff = (1800 × 10) + 4000 = 22000 N\nThe motor must supply enough power to balance\nthis force.  Hence,\nP\n = F. v = 22000 × 2 = 44000 W = 59 hp         ⊳\n5.11  COLLISIONS\nIn physics we study motion (change in position).\nAt the same time, we try to discover physical\nquantities, which do not change in a physical\nprocess. The laws of momentum and energy\nconservation are typical examples. In this\nsection we shall apply these laws to a commonly\nencountered phenomena, namely collisions.\nSeveral games such as billiards, marbles or\ncarrom involve collisions.W e shall study the\ncollision of two masses in an idealised form.\nConsider two masses m1 and m2.  The particle\nm1 is moving with speed v1i , the subscript ‘i ’\nimplying initial. W e can cosider m2  to be at r est.\nNo loss of generality is involved in making such\na selection. In this situation the  mass m1\ncollides  with  the stationary  mass m2  and  this\nis depicted in  Fig. 5.10.\nFig. 5. 10 Collision of mass m1, with a stationary mass m2.\nThe masses m1 and m2 fly-off in different\ndirections.  W e shall see that ther e are\nrelationships, which connect the masses, the\nvelocities and the angles.uunlike the conservative force, Wnc  depends on\nthe particular path i  to  f. ⊳\n5.10  POWER\nOften it is interesting to know not only the work\ndone on an object, but also the rate at which\nthis work is done. W e say a person is physically\nfit if he not only climbs four floors of a building\nbut climbs them fast. Power is defined as the\ntime rate at which work is done or energy is\ntransferred.\nThe average power of a force is defined as the\nratio of the work, W, to the total time t taken\nPW\ntav=\nThe instantaneous power is defined as the\nlimiting value of the average power as time\ninterval approaches zero,\nd\ndWPt= (5.20)\nThe work dW done by a force F for a displacement\ndr is dW = F.dr.  The instantaneous power can\nalso be expressed as\nd\ndPt=F.r\n= F.v (5.21)\nwhere v is the instantaneous velocity when the\nforce is F.\nPower , like work and ener gy, is a scalar\nquantity.  Its dimensions are [ML2T–\n3]. In the SI,\nits unit is called a watt (W).  The watt is 1 J s–1.\nThe unit of power is named after James W att,\none of the innovators of the steam engine in the\neighteenth century.\nThere is another unit of power , namely the\nhorse-power (hp)\n1 hp = 746 W\nThis unit is still used to describe the output of\nautomobiles, motorbikes, etc.\nWe encounter the unit watt when we buy\nelectrical goods such as bulbs, heaters and\nrefrigerators.  A 100 watt bulb which is on for 10\nhours uses 1 kilowatt hour (kWh) of energy.\n100 (watt) × 10 (hour)\n= 1000 watt hour\n=1 kilowatt hour (kWh)\n= 103 (W) × 3600 (s)\n= 3.6 × 106 J\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPHYSICS 84\n5.11.1   Elastic and  Inelastic Collisions\nIn all collisions the total linear momentum is\nconserved; the initial momentum of the system\nis equal to the final momentum of the system.\nOne can argue this as follows.  When two objects\ncollide, the mutual impulsive forces acting over\nthe collision time ∆t cause a change in their\nrespective momenta :\n∆p1 = F12  ∆t\n∆p2 = F21  ∆t\nwhere F12 is  the force exerted on the first particle\nby the second particle. F21 is likewise the force\nexerted on the second particle by the first particle.\nNow from Newton’s third law, F12 = − F21.  This\nimplies\n∆p1 + ∆p2 =  0\nThe above conclusion is true even though the\nforces vary in a complex fashion during the\ncollision time ∆t. Since the third law is true at\nevery instant, the total impulse on the first object\nis equal and opposite to that on the second.\nOn the other hand, the total kinetic energy of\nthe system is not necessarily conserved. The\nimpact and deformation during collision may\ngenerate heat and sound. Part of the initial kinetic\nenergy is transformed into other forms of energy.\nA useful way to visualise  the deformation during\ncollision is in terms of a ‘compressed spring ’. If\nthe ‘spring ’ connecting the two masses regains\nits original shape without loss in energy , then\nthe initial kinetic energy is equal to the final\nkinetic energy but the kinetic energy during the\ncollision time ∆t is not constant. Such a collision\nis called an elastic collision . On the other hand\nthe deformation may not be relieved and the two\nbodies could move together after the collision. A\ncollision in which the two particles move together\nafter the collision is called a completely inelastic\ncollision . The intermediate case where the\ndeformation is partly relieved and some of the\ninitial kinetic energy is lost is more common and\nis appropriately called an inelastic collision .\n5.11.2   Collisions in One Dimension\nConsider first a completely inelastic collision\nin one dimension.

In practice,\nhowever , this number is smaller since head-on\ncollisions are rare. ⊳\nIf the initial velocities and final velocities of\nboth the bodies are along the same straight line,\nthen it is called a one-dimensional collision, or\nhead-on collision.  In the case of small spherical\nbodies, this is possible if the direction of travel\nof body 1 passes through the centre of body 2\nwhich is at rest. In general, the collision is two-dimensional, where the initial velocities and the\nfinal velocities lie in a plane.\n5.11.3  Collisions in Two Dimensions\nFig. 5.10 also depicts the collision of a moving\nmass m1 with the stationary mass m2. Linear\nmomentum is conserved in such a collision.\nSince momentum is a vector this implies three\nequations for the three directions { x, y, z }.\nConsider the plane determined by the final\nvelocity directions of m1 and m2 and choose it to\nbe the x-y plane. The conservation of the\nz-component of the linear momentum implies\nthat the entire collision is in the x-y \nplane. The\nx- and y-component equations are\nm1v1i = m1v1f cos θ 1 + m2v2f cos θ 2     (5.28)\n0  = m1v1f  sin θ1 −  m2v2f sin θ2        (5.29)\nOne knows { m1, m2, v1i} in most situations.  There\nare thus four unknowns { v1f, v2f, θ1 and θ2}, and\nonly two equations. If θ 1 = θ 2 = 0, we regain\nEq. (5.23) for one dimensional collision.\nIf, further the collision is elastic,\n2 2 2\n1 1 1 1 2 21 1 1\n2 2 2i f f m v m v m v= + (5.30)\nWe obtain an additional equation. That still\nleaves us one equation short.  At least one of\nthe four unknowns, say θ 1, must be made known\nfor the problem to be solvable. For example, θ1\ncan be determined by moving a detector in an\nangular fashion from the x  to the y  axis. Given\n{m1, m2, v1i, θ1} we can determine { v1f, v2f, θ2}\nfrom Eqs. (5.28)-(5.30).\nExample 5.12  Consider the collision\ndepicted in Fig. 5.10 to be between two\nbilliard balls with equal masses  m1 = m2.\nThe first  ball  is  called the cue while the\nsecond ball is called the target. The\nbilliard player wants to ‘sink’ the target\nball in a corner pocket, which is at an\nangle θ2 = 37°. Assume that the collision is\nelastic and that friction and rotational\nmotion are not important.  Obtain θ 1.\nAnswer    From momentum conservation, since\nthe masses are equal\n2f 1f 1iv v v+ =\nor()()2\n1 2 1 2 1iv= + ⋅ +v v v vf f f f\n          2 2\n1 2 1 22 .f f f f v v= + + v v\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPHYSICS 86\n() { }2 2\n1 2 1 2 1 2 cos  37  f f f f v v v v θ = + + + ° (5.31)\nSince the collision is elastic and m1 = m2 it follows\nfrom conservation of kinetic energy that\n2 2 2\n1 1 2  i f fv v v= + (5.32)\nComparing Eqs. (5.31) and (5.32), we get\ncos (θ1 + 37°) = 0\norθ1 + 37°  = 90°\nThus,    θ1 = 53°\nThis proves the following result :  when two equal\nmasses undergo a glancing elastic collision with\none of them at rest, after the collision, they will\nmove at right angles to each other .                ⊳The matter simplifies greatly if we consider\nspherical masses with smooth surfaces, and\nassume that collision takes place only when the\nbodies touch each other . This is what happens\nin the games of marbles, carrom and billiards.\nIn our everyday world, collisions take place only\nwhen two bodies touch each other . But consider\na comet coming from far distances to the sun, or\nalpha particle coming towards a nucle us and\ngoing away in some direction. Here we have to\ndeal with forces involving action at a distance.\nSuch an event is called scattering. The velocities\nand directions in which the two particles go away\ndepend on their initial velocities as well as the\ntype of interaction between them, their masses,\nshapes and sizes.\nSUMMARY\n1.The work-energy theorem states  that  the change in kinetic energy of a body is the work\ndone by the net force on the body.\nKf - Ki = Wnet\n2.A  force is conservative if (i) work done by it on an object is path  independent and\ndepends only on the end points { xi, xj}, or (ii) the work done by the force is zero for an\narbitrary closed path taken by the object such that it returns to its initial position.\n3.For a conservative force in one dimension, we may define a potential energy function V(x)\nsuch that\nF xV x\nx( )= −( )d\nd\norV V = F x  xi f\nxx\nif\n− ()∫d\n4.The principle of conservation of mechanical energy states that the total mechanical\nenergy of a body remains constant if the only forces that act on the body are conservative.\n5.The gravitational potential energy of a particle of mass m at a height x  about the earth’s\nsurface is\nV(x) = m g x\nwhere the variation of g with height is ignored.\n5.The elastic potential energy of a spring of force constant k  and extension x is\nV x    k x()=1\n22\n7. The scalar or dot product of two vectors A and B is written as A.B  and is a scalar\nquantity given by : A.B = AB cos θ,  where θ  is the angle between A and B.  It can be\npositive, negative or zero depending upon the value of θ. The scalar product of two\nvectors can be interpreted as the product of magnitude of one vector and component\nof the other vector along the first vector . For unit vectors :\nˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆi i j j k k⋅ = ⋅ = ⋅ = 1 and ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆi j j k k i⋅ = ⋅ = ⋅ = 0\nScalar products obey the commutative and  the distributive laws.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nWORK, ENERGY AND POWER 87\nPOINTS TO PONDER\n1.The phrase ‘calculate the work done’ is incomplete. W e should r efer (or imply\nclearly by context) to the work done by a specific force or a group of forces on a\ngiven  body over a certain displacement.\n2.Work done is a scalar quantity. It can be positive or negative unlike mass and\nkinetic energy which are positive scalar quantities. The work done by the friction\nor viscous force on a moving body is negative.\n3.For two bodies, the sum of the mutual forces exerted between them is zero from\nNewton’s Third Law,\nF12  +  F21  =  0\nBut the sum of the work done by the two forces need not always cancel, i.e.\nW12  + W21  ≠  0\nHowever , it may sometimes be true.\n4.The work done by a force can be calculated sometimes even if the exact nature of\nthe force is not known. This is clear from Example 5.2 where the WE theorem is\nused in such a situation.\n5.The WE theorem is not independent of Newton’s Second Law. The WE theorem\nmay be viewed as a scalar form of the Second Law. The principle of conservation\nof mechanical energy may be viewed as a consequence of the  WE theorem for\nconservative forces.\n5.The WE theorem holds in all inertial frames. It can also be extended to non-\ninertial frames provided we include the pseudoforces in the calculation of the\nnet force acting on the body under consideration.\n7.The potential energy of a body subjected to a conservative force is always\nundetermined upto a constant. For example, the point where the potential\nenergy is zero is a matter of choice. For the gravitational  potential energy mg h,\nthe zero of the potential energy is chosen to be the ground. For the spring\npotential energy kx2/2 , the zero of the potential energy is the equilibrium position\nof the oscillating mass.\n8.Every force encountered in mechanics does not have an associated potential\nenergy. For example, work done by friction over a closed path is not zero and no\npotential energy can be associated with friction.\n9.During a collision  : (a) the total linear momentum is conserved at each instant of\nthe collision  ; (b) the kinetic energy conservation (even if the collision is  elastic)\napplies after the collision is over and does not hold at every instant of the collision.\nIn fact the two colliding objects are deformed and may  be momentarily at rest\nwith r espect to each other .\nReprint 2025-26\n\nPHYSICS 88\nEXERCISES\n5.1 The sign of work done by a force on a body is important to understand.
