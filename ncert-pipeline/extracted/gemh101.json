Can we say that their\ndifference is also an integer?\nObserve the following table and complete it:\nStatement Observation\n(i)7 – 9 = – 2 Result is an integer\n(ii)17 – (– 21) = _______ ______________\n(iii)(– 8) – (–14) = 6 Result is an integer\n(iv)(– 21) – (– 10) = _______ ______________\n(v)32 – (–17) = _______ ______________\n(vi)(– 18) – (– 18) = _______ ______________\n(vii) (– 29) – 0 = _______ ______________\nWhat do you observe? Is there any pair of integers whose difference is not an integer?\nCan we say integers are closed under subtraction? Yes, we can see that integers are\nclosed under subtraction .\nThus, if a and b ar e two integers  then a – b is also an intger . Do the whole numbers\nsatisfy this property?\n1.1.3  Commutative Property\nWe know that 3 + 5 = 5 + 3 = 8, that is, the whole numbers can be added in any order . In\nother words, addition is commutative for whole numbers.\nCan we say the same for integers also?\nWe have 5 + (– 6) = –1 and (– 6) + 5 = –1\nSo, 5 + (– 6) = (– 6) + 5\nAre the following equal?\n(i)(– 8) + (– 9) and (– 9) + (– 8)\n(ii) (– 23) + 32 and 32 + (– 23)\n(iii) (– 45) + 0 and 0 + (– 45)\nTry this with five other pairs of integers. Do you find any pair of integers for which the\nsums are dif ferent when the order is changed? Certainly not. We say that addition is\ncommutative for integers .\n2024-25\n\nINTEGERS 3\nIn general, for any two integers a and b, we can say\na + b =b + a\n/circle6We know that subtraction is not commutative for whole numbers. Is it commutative\nfor  integers?\nConsider the integers 5 and (–3).\nIs 5 – (–3) the same as (–3) –5? No, because  5 – ( –3) = 5 + 3 = 8, and (–3) – 5\n= – 3 – 5 = – 8.\nTake atleast five dif ferent pairs of integers and check this.\nWe conclude that subtraction is not commutative for integers.\n1.1.4  Associative Property\nObserve the following examples:\nConsider the integers –3, –2 and –5.\nLook at (–5) + [(–3) + (–2)] and [(–5) + (–3)] + (–2).\nIn the first sum (–3) and (–2) are grouped together and in the second (–5) and (–3)\nare grouped together . We will check whether we get dif ferent results.\n(–5) + [(–3) + (–2)] [(–5) + (–3)] + (–2)\nIn both the cases, we get –10.\ni.e., (–5) + [(–3) + (–2)] = [(–5) + (–2)] + (–3)\nSimilarly consider  –3 , 1 and  –7.\n( –3) + [1 + (–7)] = –3 + __________ = __________\n[(–3) + 1] + (–7) = –2 + __________ = __________\nIs (–3) + [1 + (–7)] same as [(–3) + 1] + (–7)?\nTake five more such examples. You will not find any example for which the sums are\ndifferent. Addition is associative for integers .\nIn general for any integers a, b and c, we can say\na + (b+ c) = (a + b) + c\n2024-25\n\nMATHEMA TICS 4\nTRY THESE\nEXAMPLE  1Write down a pair of integers whose\n(a)sum is –3 (b)difference is  –5\n(c)difference is 2 (d)sum is 0\nSOLUTION (a)(–1) + (–2) = –3 or (–5) + 2 = –3\n(b)(–9) – (– 4) = –5 or (–2) – 3 = –5\n(c)(–7) – (–9) = 2 or 1 – (–1) = 2\n(d)(–10) + 10 = 0 or 5 + (–5) = 0\n              Can you write more pairs in these examples?1.1.5  Additive Identity\nWhen we add zero to any whole number , we get the same whole number . Zero is an\nadditive identity for whole numbers. Is it an additive identity again for integers also?\nObserve the following and fill in the blanks:\n(i)(– 8) + 0  = – 8 (ii)0 + (– 8) = – 8\n(iii) (–23) + 0 = _____ (iv) 0 + (–37) = –37\n(v)0 + (–59) = _____ (vi) 0 + _____ = – 43\n(vii) – 61 + _____ = – 61 (viii) _____ + 0 = _____\nThe above examples show that zero is an additive identity for integers.\nYou can verify it by adding zero to any other five integers.\nIn general, for any integer a\na + 0 = a = 0 + a\n1.Write a pair of integers whose sum gives\n(a)a negative integer (b) zero\n(c)an integer smaller than both the integers. (d) an integer smaller than only one of the integers.\n(e)an integer greater than both the integers.\n2.Write a pair of integers whose dif ference gives\n(a)a negative integer .

Which team scored more? Can we say that we can add integers in\nany order?\n4.Fill in the blanks to make the following statements true:\n(i)(–5) + (– 8) = (– 8) + (............)\n(ii)–53 + ............ = –53\n(iii) 17 + ............ = 0\n(iv) [13 + (– 12)] + (............) = 13 + [(–12) + (–7)]\n(v)(– 4) + [15 + (–3)] = [– 4 + 15] + ............\n1.2  M ULTIPLICATION  OF INTEGERS\nWe can add and subtract integers. Let us now learn how to multiply integers.\n1.2.1  Multiplication of a Positive and a Negative Integer\nWe know that multiplication of whole numbers is repeated addition. For example,\n5 + 5 + 5 = 3 × 5 = 15\nCan you represent addition of integers in the same way?\nWe have from the following number line, (–5) + (–5) + (–5) = –15\nBut we can also write\n(–5) + (–5) + (–5) = 3 × (–5)\nTherefore, 3 × (–5) = –15–20 –15 –10 –5 0TRY THESE\nFind:\n4 × (– 8),\n8 × (–2),\n3 × (–7),\n10 × (–1)\nusing number line.\n2024-25\n\nMATHEMA TICS 6\nSimilarly (– 4) + (– 4) + (– 4) + (– 4) + (– 4) = 5 × (– 4) = –20\nAnd (–3) + (–3) + (–3) + (–3) = __________ = __________\nAlso, (–7) + (–7) + (–7) = __________ = __________\nLet us see how t o find the product of a positive integer and a negative integer without\nusing number line.\nLet us find 3 × (–5) in a dif ferent way . First find 3 × 5 and then put minus sign (–)\nbefore the product obtained. You get –15. That is we find – (3 × 5) to get –15.\nSimilarly , 5 × (– 4) = – (5×4) = – 20.\nFind in a similar way ,\n4 × (– 8) = _____  = _____,  3 × (– 7) = _____ = _____\n6 × (– 5) = _____  = _____,  2 × (– 9) = _____ = _____\nUsing this method we thus have,\n10 × (– 43) = _____ – (10 × 43) = – 430\nTill now we multiplied integers as (positive integer) × (negative integer).\nLet us now multiply them as (negative integer) × (positive integer).\nWe first find –3 × 5.\nTo find this, observe the following pattern:\nWe have, 3 × 5 = 15\n2 × 5 = 10 = 15 – 5\n1 × 5 = 5 = 10 – 5\n0 × 5 = 0 = 5 – 5\nSo, –1 × 5 = 0 – 5 = –5\n–2 × 5 = –5 – 5 = –10\n–3 × 5 = –10 – 5 = –15\nWe alread y have 3 × (–5) = –15\nSo we get (–3) × 5 = –15 = 3 × (–5)\nUsing such patterns, we also get (–5) × 4 = –20 = 5 × (– 4)\nUsing patterns, find (– 4) × 8, (–3) × 7, (– 6) × 5 and (– 2) × 9\nCheck whether ,(– 4) × 8 = 4 × (– 8), (– 3) × 7 = 3 × (–7), (– 6) × 5 = 6 × (– 5)–20 –16 –12 –8 –4 0\nTRY THESE\nFind:\n(i)6 × (–19)\n(ii)12 × (–32)\n(iii) 7 × (–22)\n2024-25\n\nINTEGERS 7\nTRY THESE\nand (– 2) × 9 = 2 × (– 9)\nUsing this we get, (–33) × 5 = 33 × (–5) = –165\nWe thus find that while multiplying a positive integer and a negative integer , we\nmultiply them as whole numbers and put a minus sign (–) befor e the pr oduct. W e\nthus get a negative integer .\n 1.Find: (a) 15 × (–16) (b) 21 × (–32)\n(c) (– 42) × 12 (d) –55 × 15\n 2.Check if (a) 25 × (–21) = (–25) × 21 (b) (–23) × 20 = 23 × (–20)\nWrite five more such examples.\nIn general, for any two positive integers a and b we can say\na × (– b) = (– a) × b = – (a × b)\n1.2.2  Multiplication of two Negative Integers\nCan you find the product  (–3) × (–2)?\nObserve the following:\n–3 × 4 = – 12\n–3 × 3 = –9 = –12 – (–3)\n–3 × 2 = – 6 = –9 – (–3)\n–3 × 1 = –3 = – 6 – (–3)\n–3 × 0 = 0   = –3 – (–3)\n–3 × –1 = 0 – (–3) = 0 + 3 = 3\n–3 × –2 = 3 – (–3) = 3 + 3 = 6\nDo you see any pattern? Observe how the products change.\nBased on this observation, complete the following:\n–3 × –3 = _____ –3 × – 4 = __ ___\nNow observe these products and fill in the blanks:\n– 4 × 4 = –16\n– 4 × 3 = –12  = –16 + 4\n– 4 × 2 =  _____ = –12 + 4\n2024-25\n\nMATHEMA TICS 8\n– 4 × 1 = _____\n– 4 × 0 = _____\n– 4 × (–1) = _____\n– 4 × (–2) = _____\n– 4 × (–3) = _____\nFrom these patterns we observe that,\n(–3) × (–1) = 3 = 3 × 1\n(–3) × (–2) = 6 = 3 × 2\n(–3) × (–3) = 9 = 3 × 3\nand (– 4) × (–1) = 4 = 4 × 1\nSo, (– 4) × (–2) = 4 × 2   =  _____\n(– 4) × (–3) = _____ = _____\nSo observing these products we can say that the product of two negative integers is\na positive integer . We multiply the two negative integers as whole numbers and put\nthe positive sign befor e the pr oduct.\nThus, we have (–10) × (–12) = + 120 = 120\nSimilarly (–15) × (– 6) = + 90 = 90\nIn general, for any two positive integers a and b,\n(– a) × (–  b) = a × b\nFind:  (–31) × (–100), (–25) × (–72), (–83) × (–28)\nGame 1\n(i)Take a board marked from –104 to 104 as shown in the figure.\n(ii)Take a bag containing two blue and two red dice.

That is, a + 0 = 0 + a = a  for every\ninteger a.\n2.We studied, how integers could be multiplied, and found that product of a positive\nand a negative integer is a negative integer , whereas the product of two negative\nintegers is a positive integer . For example, – 2 × 7 = – 14 and – 3 × – 8 = 24.\n3.Product of even number of negative integers is positive, whereas the product of odd\nnumber of negative integers is negative.\n4.Integers show some properties under multiplication.\n(a)Integers are closed under multiplication. That is, a × b is an integer for any two\nintegers a and b.\n(b)Multiplication is commutative for integers. That is, a × b = b × a for any integers\na and b.\n(c)The integer 1 is the identity under multiplication, i.e., 1 × a = a × 1 = a for any\ninteger a.\n(d)Multiplication is associative for integers, i.e., ( a × b) × c = a × (b × c) for any\nthree integers a, b and c.\n5.Under addition and multiplication, integers show a property called distributive\nproperty .
