The Department of Environment is to decide whether some portion of a\nforest in your area could be cleared for a housing complex. Write a letter\nto the department explaining your point of view as a concerned citizen.\n2. Visit a forest. Here is a list of points that would make your visit more\nfruitful.\n(a) Make sure that you have permission to go into the forest.\n(b) Make sure that you can find your way around. Get a map and go\nalong with some one who is familiar with the area.\n(c) Keep a record of the things you see and do. Observations make\nthe visit interesting. Sketches and photographs are useful.\n(d) You may record bird calls.\n(e) Collect different kinds of seeds or hard fruits like nuts.\n(f ) Try to recognise various types of trees, shrubs, herbs, etc. Make\nlists of plants from different places in the forest and of different\nlayers. You may not be able to name all the plants, but it is worthrecording and seeing where they grow. Make a record ofapproximate heights of plants, crown shape, bark texture, leafsize, and flower colour.\n(g) Learn to recognise the animal’s droppings.\n(h) Interview the forest officials and the people of surrounding vil\nlages and other visitors.\nYou must never collect birds’ eggs, and their nests should never bedisturbed.\nYou can read more on the following website:www.wild-india.com\nDid you know?\nIn India the area under forest cover is about 21% of the total area. It had\nsteadily been falling since independence. But people now seem to haverealised the importance of the forest cover. Reports suggest that the areaunder forest cover has slightly increased in recent years.\nReprint 2024-25\n\n",
