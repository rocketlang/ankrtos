This lesson contains activities,\nwhich require visits — visit to consumer\nprotection councils, consumer organisations,\nDistrict/State/National level Consumer\nDisputes Redressal Commissions, retail shops,\nmarketplaces, etc. Organise the visits to\nmaximise learners’ experience.  Have a\ndiscussion with them about the purpose of the\nvisit, things they need to do beforehand and\nthings that need to be collected and the task\n(report/ project / article, etc.) they would carry\nout after the visit. As part of this chapter , the\nlearners may do letter -writing and speaking\nactivities. W e may have to be sensitive to the\nlanguage aspect of exercises.\nThis chapter contains material collected\nfrom authenticated websites, books, newspapers\nand magazines. For example, https://consumer\naffairs.nic.in  is a website of Central Government\nMinistry of Consumer Affairs, Food & Public\nDistribution. Another website www.cuts-\ninternational.org  is the website of a consumer\norganisation working in India for 40 years. It\npublishes a variety of material to create\nconsumer awareness in India. They need to be\nshared among learners so that they can also\ncollect material as part of their activities. For\nexample, case histories were taken from\nnewspaper clippings and consumers who fought\nin Consumer Disputes Redressal Commissions.\nLet learners collect and read such material from\ndifferent sources: consumer protection councils,\nConsumer Disputes Redressal Commissions\nand internet.\nReprint 2025-26\nReprint 2025-26\n\nCONSUMER RIGHTSCONSUMER RIGHTSCONSUMER RIGHTSCONSUMER RIGHTSCONSUMER RIGHTSCHAPTER 5\nThe collage you see below contains\nsome news clippings of Consumer\nDisputes Redressal Commission\nverdicts. Why did the people go to\nthese organisations in these cases?\nThese verdicts came about because\nsome people persisted and struggled\nto get justice. In what ways were they\ndenied justice? More importantly,what are the ways in which they can\nexercise their rights as consumers to\nget a fair deal from the sellers when\nthey felt they had been denied a just\ntreatment?\nReprint 2025-26\nReprint 2025-26\n\nWe participate in the market both as\nproducers and consumers. As\nproducers of goods and services we\ncould be working in any of the sectors\ndiscussed earlier such as agriculture,\nindustry, or services. Consumers\nparticipate in the market when they\npurchase goods and services that they\nneed. These are the final goods that\npeople as consumers use.\nIn the preceding chapters we\ndiscussed the need for rules and\nregulations or steps that would\npromote development. These could be\nfor the protection of workers in the\nunorganised sector or to protect\npeople from high interest rates\ncharged by moneylenders  in the\ninformal sector . Similarly, rules and\nregulations are also required for\nprotecting the environment.\nFor example, moneylenders in the\ninformal sector that you read about\nin Chapter 3 adopt various tricks to\nbind the borrower: they could make\nthe producer sell the produce to them\nat a low rate in return for a timely loan;\nthey could force a small farmer like\nSwapna to sell her land to pay back\nthe loan. Similarly, many people who\nwork in the unorganised sector have\nto work at a low wage and accept\nconditions that are not fair and are\nalso often harmful to their health. To\nprevent such exploitation, we\nhave talked of rules and regulations\nfor their protection. There are\norganisations that have struggled\nfor long to ensure that these rules are\nfollowed.THE CONSUMER IN THE MARKETPLACE\nLikewise, r ules and regulations are\nrequired for the protection of the\nconsumers in the marketplace.\nIndividual consumers often find\nthemselves in a weak position.\nWhenever there is a complaint\nregarding a good or service that had\nbeen bought, the seller tries to shift\nall the responsibility on to the buyer .\nTheir position usually is – “If you\ndidn’t like what you bought, please\ngo elsewhere”. As if the seller has no\nresponsibility once a sale is\ncompleted! The consumer movement,\nas we shall discuss later , is an ef fort\nto change this situation.\nExploitation in the marketplace\nhappens in various ways. For\nexample, sometimes traders indulge\nin unfair trade practices such as when\nshopkeepers weigh less than what\nthey should or when traders add\ncharges that were not mentioned\nbefore, or when adulterated/defective\ngoods are sold.\nMarkets do not work in a fair\nmanner when producers are few and\npowerful whereas consumers\npurchase in small amounts and are\nscattered. This happens especially\nwhen large companies are producing\nthese goods. These companies with\nhuge wealth, power and reach can\nmanipulate the market in various\nways. At times false information is\npassed on through the media, and\nother sources to attract consumers.\nFor example, a company for years\nsold powder milk for babies all over\nTHEY PURPOSEL Y MADE IT\nSO IT WOULD F ALL AP ART\nAFTER A FEW MONTHS SO\nTHAT I WILL BUY A NEW ONE!\nReprint 2025-26\nReprint 2025-26\n\n77 7777 7777 C CCCCONSUMERONSUMERONSUMERONSUMERONSUMER  R  R R  R RIGHTSIGHTSIGHTS IGHTSIGHTS1. What are the various ways by which people may be exploited in the market?\n2. Think of one example from your experience where you thought that there was some\n‘cheating’ in the market. Discuss in the classroom.\n3.What do you think should be the role of government to protect consumers?LET’S WORK THESE OUTthe world as the most scientific\nproduct claiming this to be better\nthan mother’s milk. It took years of\nstruggle before the company was\nforced to accept that it had been\nmaking false claims. Similarly, a\nlong battle had to be fought with\ncourt cases to make cigarette-\nmanufacturing companies accept that\ntheir pr oduct could cause cancer .\nHence, there is a need for rules and\nregulations to ensure protection for\nconsumers.\nCONSUMER MO VEMENT\nquality of goods and services on the\nsellers.\nIn India, the consumer movement\nas a ‘social force’ originated with the\nnecessity of protecting and promoting\nthe interests of consumers against\nunethical and unfair trade practices.\nRampant food shortages, hoarding,\nblack marketing, adulteration of food\nand edible oil gave birth to the\nconsumer movement in an organised\nform in the 1960s. T ill the 1970s,\nconsumer organisations were largely\nengaged in writing articles and\nholding exhibitions. They formed\nconsumer groups to look into the\nmalpractices in ration shops and\novercrowding in the road passenger\ntransport. More recently, India\nwitnessed an upsurge in the number\nof consumer groups.The consumer movement arose out\nof dissatisfaction of the consumers\nas many unfair practices were being\nindulged in by the sellers. There was\nno legal system available to\nconsumers to protect them from\nexploitation in the marketplace. For\na long time, when a consumer was\nnot happy with a particular brand\nproduct or shop, he or she generally\navoided buying that brand product,\nor would stop purchasing from that\nshop. It was presumed that it was\nthe responsibility of consumers to be\ncareful while buying a commodity\nor service. It took many years for\norganisations in India, and around\nthe world, to create awareness\namongst people. This has also\nshifted the responsibility of ensuring\nEVERYONE KNOWS\nTOBACCO KILLS PEOPLE,\nBUT WHO CAN SA Y THA T\nTOBACCO COMP ANIES\nSHOULD NOT BE FREE\nTO SELL T OBACCO?\nReprint 2025-26\nReprint 2025-26\n\n1.What could have been the steps taken by consumer groups?\n2.There may be rules and regulations but they are often not followed. Why? Discuss.LET’S WORK THESE OUTConsumers International\nIn 1985 United Nations adopted\nthe UN Guidelines for Consumer\nProtection. This was a tool for\nnations to adopt measures to\nprotect consumers and for\nconsumer advocacy groups to\npress their gover nments to do\nso. At the inter national level, this\nhas become the foundation for\nconsumer movement. Today,\nConsumers Inter national has\nbecome an umbrella body  to\nover 200 member organisations\nfrom over 100 countries.\nBecause of all these efforts, the movement succeeded in\nbringing pressure on business firms as well as government\nto correct business conduct which may be unfair and against\nthe interests of consumers at large. A major step taken in\n1986 by the Indian government was the enactment of the\nConsumer Protection Act 1986, popularly known as COPRA.\nYou will lear n mor e about COPRA later .\nReprint 2025-26\nReprint 2025-26\n\n79 7979 7979 C CCCCONSUMERONSUMERONSUMERONSUMERONSUMER  R  R R  R RIGHTSIGHTSIGHTS IGHTSIGHTSSAFETY IS EVER YONE’S RIGHT\nReji’s SufferingReji’s SufferingReji’s SufferingReji’s SufferingReji’s SufferingCONSUMER RIGHTS\nReji’s suffering shows how a\nhospital, due to negligence by the\ndoctors and staff in giving\nanaesthesia, crippled a student for\nlife. While using many goods and\nservices, we as consumers, have the\nright to be protected against the\nmarketing of goods and delivery of\nservices that are hazardous to life and\nproperty. Producers need to strictly\nfollow the required safety rules and\nregulations. There are many goods\nand services that we purchase that\nrequire special attention to safety. For\nexample, pressure cookers have a\nsafety valve which, if it is defective, can\ncause a serious accident. The\nmanufacturers of the safety valve have\nto ensur e high quality. Y ou also need\npublic or government action to see\nthat this quality is maintained.\nHowever , we do find bad quality\nproducts in the market because the\nsupervision of these rules is weak and\nthe consumer movement is also not\nstrong enough.\n1.For the following (you can add to the list) product s/services discuss what safety\nrules should be observed by the producer?\n(a) LPG cylinder (b) cinema theatre (c) circus (d) medicines (e) edible oil\n(f) marriage pandal (g) a high-rise building.\n2.Find out any case of accident or negligence from people around you, where you think\nthat the responsibility lay with the producer . Discuss.LET’S WORK THESE OUT\nReji Mathew, a healthy boy studying in\nClass IX, was admitted in a private clinic in\nKerala for removal of tonsils. An ENT\nsurgeon per formed the tonsillectomy\noperation under general anaesthesia. As a\nresult of improper anaesthesia Reji showed\nsymptoms of some brain abnor malities\nbecause of which he was crippled for life.\nHis father filed a complaint in the State\nConsumer Disputes Redressal Commission\nclaiming compensation of Rs 5,00,000 for\nmedical negligence and deficiency, in\nservice. The State Commission, saying that\nthe evidence was not sufficient, dismissed\nit. Reji’s father appealed again in the\nNational Consumer Disputes Redressal\nCommission located\nin New Delhi. The\nNational Commission\nafter looking into the\ncomplaint, held the\nhospital responsible\nfor medical negligence\nand directed it to pay\nthe compensation.\nReprint 2025-26\nReprint 2025-26\n\n80 8080 8080 U UU UUNDERSTNDERSTNDERST NDERSTNDERST ANDING ANDINGANDING ANDINGANDING  E  E E  E ECONOMICCONOMICCONOMICCONOMICCONOMIC  D  D D  D DEVEL EVELEVEL EVELEVEL OPMENT OPMENTOPMENT OPMENTOPMENTInformation about goods and\nservices\nWhen you buy any commodity, you\nwill find certain details given on the\npacking. These details are about\ningredients used, price, batch\nnumber , date of manufactur e, expiry\ndate and the address of the\nmanufactur er. When we buy\nmedicines, on the packets, you might\nfind ‘directions for proper use’ and\ninformation relating to side effects and\nrisks associated with usage of that\nmedicine. When you buy garments,\nyou will find information on\n‘instructions for washing’.\nWhy is it that rules have been made\nso that the manufacturer displays this\ninformation? It is because consumers\nhave the right to be informed  about\nthe particulars of goods and services\nthat they purchase. Consumers\ncan then complain and ask for\ncompensation or replacement if the\nproduct proves to be defective in any\nmanner . For example, if we buy aproduct a nd find it defective well\nwithin the expiry period, we can ask\nfor a replacement. If the expiry period\nwas not printed, the manufacturer\nwould blame the shopkeeper and will\nnot accept the responsibility. If people\nsell medicines that have expired\nsevere action can be taken against\nthem. Similarly, one can protest and\ncomplain if someone sells a good at\nmore than the printed price on the\npacket. This is indicated by ‘MRP’ —\nmaximum retail price. In fact\nconsumers can bargain with the seller\nto sell at less than the MRP .\nIn recent times, the right to\ninformation has been expanded to\ncover various services provided by the\nGovernment. In October 2005, the\nGovernment of India enacted a law,\npopularly known as R TI (Right to\nInformation) Act, which ensures its\ncitizens all the information about the\nfunctions of government departments.\nThe ef fect of the R TI Act can be\nunderstood from th e following case.\nWaiting...Waiting...Waiting...Waiting...Waiting...\nAmritha, an engineering graduate\nafter submitting all the certificates\nand attending the interview for a\njob in a gover nment department, did\nnot receive any news of the result.\nThe officials also refused to comply\nwith her queries. She therefore filed\nan application using the R TI Act\nsaying that it was her right to know\nthe result in a reasonable time so\nthat she could plan her future. She\nwas  not only infor med about the\nreasons for delay in the declaration\nof results but also got her call letter\nfor appointment as she per formed\nwell in the interview.\nReprint 2025-26\nReprint 2025-26\n\n81 8181 8181 C CCCCONSUMERONSUMERONSUMERONSUMERONSUMER  R  R R  R RIGHTS IGHTSIGHTSIGHTSIGHTS1.When we buy commodities we find that the price charged is sometimes higher or\nlower than the Maximum Retail Price printed on the pack.

At the\ntime of joining the course,\nshe paid the fees Rs 61,020\nas lumpsum for the entire\ncourse of two years.\nHowever , she decided to opt\nout of the course at the end of one year\nas she found that the quality of\nteaching was not up to the mark. When\nshe asked for a refund of the fee for one\nyear, it was denied to her .\nWhen she filed the case in the District\nConsumer Disputes Redressal\nCommission, the Commission directed\nthe Institute to refund Rs 28,000 saying\nthat she had the right to choose. TheInstitute again appealed\nin the State Consumer\nCom-mission. The State\nCommission upheld the\nDistrict Commission’s\ndirection and further\nfined the institute\nRs 25,000 for a frivolous\nappeal. It also directed\nthe institute to pay\nRs 7000 as compensation and\nlitigation cost.\nThe State Commission also restrained\nall the educational and professional\ninstitutions in the state from charging\nfees from students for the entire\nduration of the course in advance and\nthat too at one go. Any violation of this\norder may invite penalties and\nimprisonment, the commission said.\nif you buy a toothbrush. If you are not\ninterested in buying the brush, your\nright to choice is denied. Similarly ,\nsometimes gas supply dealers insist\nthat you have to buy the stove from\nthem when you take a new connection.\nIn this way many a times you are\nforced to buy things that you may not\nwish to and you are left with no choice.What do we understand from this\nincident?
