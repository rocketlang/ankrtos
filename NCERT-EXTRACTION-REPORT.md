## 🏗️ Infrastructure Built

### Extraction Pipeline
- ✅ Automated PDF processing with pdftotext
- ✅ AI-powered exercise parsing (Claude 3.5 Sonnet)
- ✅ Structured JSON output format
- ✅ Database ingestion with conflict handling
- ✅ Automatic module creation
- ✅ Priority-based processing (Class 10 first)

### Solving Pipeline
- ✅ Batch processing with error handling
- ✅ AI solution generation via proxy (localhost:4444)
- ✅ Step-by-step solution formatting
- ✅ Transaction-safe database updates
- ✅ Progress tracking and logging

### Key Features
- **Parallel processing:** Extraction and solving run concurrently
- **Fault tolerance:** Handles corrupted PDFs, network errors gracefully
- **Incremental:** Skips already processed files
- **Resumable:** Can restart from any point

## ⚠️ Known Issues & Limitations

### Corrupted PDFs
Several PDFs are unreadable due to file corruption:
- `jemh102.pdf` (Class 10 Math Ch 2)
- `jemh105.pdf` (Class 10 Math Ch 5)
- `jesc104.pdf` (Class 10 Science Ch 4)
- `jesc108.pdf` (Class 10 Science Ch 8)

**Impact:** ~10-15 chapters could not be extracted
**Solution:** Need to re-download these PDFs from source

### Missing Courses
English course entries don't exist in the database:
- `class-10-english-firstflight`
- `class-10-english-footprints`

**Impact:** ~30-40 English chapter files skipped
**Solution:** Create course entries or extract to temporary course

### AI Extraction Failures
Some PDFs failed AI parsing due to:
- Complex formatting
- Unusual exercise structures
- Network timeouts to AI proxy

**Impact:** ~5% of attempted extractions
**Solution:** Retry with adjusted prompts or manual extraction
