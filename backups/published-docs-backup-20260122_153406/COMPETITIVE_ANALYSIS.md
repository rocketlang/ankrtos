## Key Takeaways

**What we learned:**
1. **Blue ocean in AI governance** - No one is doing personal AI agent monitoring
2. **Consumers want visibility** - Blocking alone is not enough anymore
3. **Cross-platform is rare** - Most solutions are platform-specific
4. **Trust matters** - Privacy-first positioning is differentiator
5. **Timing is perfect** - AI era + privacy regulations + consumer awareness

**Our Strategy:**
1. **Own the "AI privacy" category** - Be the Kleenex of AI agent security
2. **Consumer-first, enterprise later** - Build bottom-up
3. **Transparent & trustworthy** - Open core, audits, no BS
4. **Education, not fear** - Empower users with knowledge
5. **Fast iteration** - Ship features competitors can't match

---

**The Bottom Line:**

ankrshield is not competing in an existing market.

We're **creating** the market for personal AI-era security.

Our only real competitor is **user apathy** - and we beat that with education, transparency, and an amazing product.
