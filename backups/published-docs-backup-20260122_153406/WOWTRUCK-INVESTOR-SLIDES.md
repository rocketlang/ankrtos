# Slide 1: The Problem

## Indian Road Transport is Fragmented & Inefficient

| Pain Point | Impact |
|------------|--------|
| **Unorganized Sector** | 90% of trucking is owner-operated, no tech |
| **Manual Operations** | Paper LRs, phone-based tracking |
| **No Pricing Transparency** | Rates negotiated per trip, high variance |
| **Driver Management** | No visibility on HOS, behavior, documents |
| **Compliance Burden** | GST, E-way, TDS done manually |
| **Cash Leakage** | Fuel theft, route deviation, fake trips |

> **$50B+ wasted annually** in operational inefficiencies
