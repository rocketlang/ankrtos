## Slide 2: The Problem

### Users Are Losing Control of Their Digital Lives

**Three Converging Threats:**

1. **Invisible Surveillance**
   - Apps track everything (Swiggy, Zomato, Google, Microsoft)
   - 1,000+ trackers per day per user
   - Zero visibility, zero control

2. **Autonomous AI Agents**
   - ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot gaining system access
   - Reading files, accessing emails, uploading data
   - No oversight, no governance

3. **Nation-State Spyware**
   - Pegasus, Candiru targeting civilians
   - Zero-click exploits
   - Undetectable by traditional tools

**The Result:** Users are surveilled, AI is uncontrolled, devices are compromised.

## Slide 3: The Market Opportunity

### Massive, Growing, Underserved

**Market Size (2026-2031):**
- AI Security: $800B - $1.2T

## Slide 4: The Solution

# ankrshield
**Three-Layer Protection**

### Layer 1: OBSERVE

- "You had 847 tracking attempts today. We blocked 823."

### Layer 2: CONTROL
- Granular policies for apps and AI agents
- "ChatGPT can read code files, but not financial documents"
- User-friendly, not technical

### Layer 3: PROTECT
- DNS blocking (1M+ trackers)
- Network firewall
- AI agent governance
- Spyware detection (Pegasus, etc.)

**Unique Approach:** Educate, don't scare. Empower, don't overwhelm.
