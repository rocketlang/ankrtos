# AnkrForge - Product Vision

> **"Forged For You"** - Mass customization platform for personalized physical products

---

## Executive Summary

AnkrForge is a **Custom-Fit-as-a-Service (CFaaS)** platform that enables the creation of perfectly personalized physical products through 3D scanning, AI-driven design, and on-demand manufacturing. The platform abstracts the complexity of custom manufacturing into a pluggable architecture where product verticals are swappable modules while core infrastructure remains constant.

---

## The Problem

### Current State of Custom Products
- **Expensive**: Custom-fit products require manual measurements, specialist visits
- **Slow**: Weeks to months for delivery
- **Limited Access**: Only available in premium markets
- **Fragmented**: Each product category has separate infrastructure
- **Poor Fit**: "One size fits all" or limited size ranges don't serve diverse body types

### Market Pain Points
| Stakeholder | Pain Point |
|-------------|------------|
| **Consumers** | Can't get affordable custom-fit products |
| **Brands** | Building custom-fit infrastructure is expensive |
| **Manufacturers** | No standardized way to receive custom orders |
| **Startups** | Each vertical requires full-stack investment |

---

## The Solution: AnkrForge

### Core Value Proposition
A **platform that commoditizes custom-fit manufacturing** by:
1. Standardizing the scan-to-product pipeline
2. Making product verticals pluggable modules
3. Providing shared infrastructure for all custom products
