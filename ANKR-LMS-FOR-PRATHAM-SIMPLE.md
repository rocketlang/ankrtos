## 🎯 The Problem We're Solving

### **Pratham's Challenges:**

1. **Students struggle with textbooks** 📚
   - 268-page books are overwhelming
   - Can't find answers quickly
   - No one to ask questions after school
   - Result: Students give up, drop out

2. **Teachers are overworked** 👨‍🏫
   - 50+ students per class
   - Can't give individual attention
   - Hours spent creating tests manually
   - No time to track each student's progress

3. **Existing solutions are too expensive** 💰
   - Byju's: ₹10,000-20,000/year per student
   - Unacademy: ₹5,000-15,000/year
   - For 10,000 students = ₹10-20 crores/year ❌

## ✨ ANKR LMS Solution

### **For Students: Your Personal AI Teacher (24/7)**

#### **1. Ask Questions Anytime**

**Problem:** It's 9 PM. You're stuck on homework. Nobody to ask.

**Solution:**
```
Student: "I don't understand probability. What is it?"

ANKR AI: "Probability tells you how likely something is to happen.

Example: Rolling a dice (6 sides)
- Chance of getting 4 = 1 out of 6
- We write this as: 1/6

Think of it like this:
If you roll 60 times, you'll get 4 about 10 times.

[From your textbook: Pages 194-198]"

⏱️ Answered in 10 seconds!
```

**Real Impact:**
