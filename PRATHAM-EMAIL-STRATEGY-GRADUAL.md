# Pratham Email Strategy - Gradual Engagement Approach

**Date:** 2026-01-24
**Version:** 2.0 (Revised - More Patient, Less Salesy)

---

## Core Philosophy

**Build trust → Understand needs → Offer tailored solution → Earn the meeting**

NOT: "Here's what we built, want a demo?"

BUT: "Here's what we learned, what are you trying to solve?"

---

## The 3-Email Sequence

### Email 1: Share Insights + Broad Questions
**Goal:** Show value, start dialogue, NO MEETING ASK
**Timing:** Send immediately (today)
**File:** PRATHAM-EMAIL-1-INSIGHTS-QUESTIONS.md

**What it does:**
- Shares analysis results (347 questions, 12 topics)
- Provides insights on content structure
- Asks 3 broad open-ended questions:
  1. Primary challenge for students?
  2. How do they access content today?
  3. Ideal experience in 6-12 months?
- Patient tone: "No rush on these"
- NO meeting suggestion

**Expected outcome:**
- They respond with context about their situation
- You learn about pain points, infrastructure, vision
- Relationship building starts

---

### Email 2: Tailored Directions + Technical Questions
**Goal:** Show you listened, suggest relevant directions, ask technical details
**Timing:** 1-2 days after they respond to Email 1
**File:** PRATHAM-EMAIL-2-TAILORED-DIRECTIONS.md

**What it does:**
- References their specific answers from Email 1
- Suggests 1-2 directions that match their pain points
- Asks technical questions:
  - Current infrastructure?
  - Student devices?
  - Online vs offline?
  - Integration vs fresh build?
- Soft meeting suggestion: "Would a call be useful, or continue email?"

**Expected outcome:**
- They answer technical questions
- They express interest in specific direction
- They might suggest call themselves

---

### Email 3: Meeting Suggestion
**Goal:** Earn the meeting through demonstrated value
**Timing:** After they respond to Email 2 with interest
**File:** PRATHAM-EMAIL-3-MEETING-SUGGESTION.md

**What it does:**
- "Based on your answers, Direction X seems best because..."
- Proposes 20-minute call with clear agenda
- Multiple time slot options
- Exit option: "Or continue via email"
- No pressure tone

**Expected outcome:**
- They schedule the call
- Or ask for more info (continue email dialogue)

---

## Key Principles

### 1. Patience Over Pressure
- Don't rush to the meeting ask
- Let them guide the pace
- Each email adds value independently
- If they ghost, graceful exit

### 2. Listen Before Pitching
- Email 1: Ask questions
- Email 2: Show you heard them
- Email 3: Propose relevant solution
- Never generic, always tailored

### 3. Multiple Exit Options
- They can say "not now" at any stage
- They can choose email over call
- They can disengage without awkwardness
- Professional relationship preserved

### 4. Value First, Always
- Every email shares insights or information
- Never just "checking in"
- Never "just following up"
- Always adding to the conversation

### 5. No Assumptions
- Don't assume they have an LMS
- Don't assume they have budget
- Don't assume they're tech-savvy
- Ask, don't assume

## What Makes This Different From Original Strategy

### Original Approach (Too Aggressive):
- Email 1: "We parsed it, here's a demo, want to see?"
- Pushed meeting in first email
- Showed all features upfront
- Assumed they wanted what we built

### New Approach (Patient & Consultative):
- Email 1: "Here's what we found, what are you trying to solve?"
- No meeting ask until Email 3
- Show only relevant features
- Build solution based on their needs

---

## Email Response Decision Tree

### After Email 1:

**If they respond with detailed answers:**
→ Send Email 2 (tailored directions)

**If they respond with brief answers:**
→ Send follow-up clarifying questions, then Email 2

**If they respond asking questions:**
→ Answer their questions, then Email 2

**If no response in 5 days:**
→ Send gentle nudge (Email 1B)

**If no response in 10 days:**
→ One final follow-up, then pause

**If they say "not interested":**
→ Thank them, stay in touch for future

---

### After Email 2:

**If they answer technical questions + express interest:**
→ Send Email 3 (meeting suggestion)

**If they say "interesting, let us discuss internally":**
→ "Take your time, I'm here when ready"

**If they ask for more information:**
→ Provide info, don't push for call yet

**If they suggest a call themselves:**
→ Great! Schedule it immediately

**If no response in 5 days:**
→ Send brief follow-up, then wait

---

### After Email 3:

**If they schedule the call:**
→ Prepare for call, send calendar invite

**If they decline call but want to continue via email:**
→ Continue dialogue, propose pilot via email

**If they say "let's revisit in a few months":**
→ "Sure, I'll check back in [timeframe]"

**If no response:**
→ One follow-up after 5 days, then back off

---

## Templates for Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: They Ghost After Email 1

**Follow-up (Day 5):**

Subject: Re: ANKR - Pratham | Quick nudge

Dear Ankit, Pranav,

Following up on my previous email about the Quantitative Aptitude analysis.

I know you're busy - no pressure. Even a one-liner on the primary challenge you're trying to solve would help me focus on relevant possibilities.

Happy to wait until you have a moment.

Best regards,
Captain Anil Sharma

---

### Scenario 2: They Say "Interesting, Let Us Discuss Internally"

**Your Response:**

Absolutely - take your time.

If it's helpful, I can provide any additional information for your internal discussions (technical feasibility, rough timelines, example use cases, etc.). Just let me know.

I'm here whenever you're ready to continue the conversation.

Best regards,
Captain Anil Sharma

---

### Scenario 3: They Ask "How Much Would This Cost?"

**Your Response (Email 1 or 2 stage):**

Good question - pricing depends heavily on the specific approach and scale.

To give you a meaningful answer, I'd need to understand:
- How many students?
- Which features are most important to you?
- Pilot first, or full deployment?
- Your budget range?

We typically work with educational institutions on either:
1. Per-student SaaS model (scales with your growth)
2. Annual licensing (predictable budgeting)
3. Revenue share (zero upfront, we grow together)

Happy to discuss specific numbers once we align on the approach.

---

### Scenario 4: They Say "We're Exploring Multiple Vendors"

**Your Response:**

That makes total sense - you should explore options.

What I can offer that might be unique:
- We've already analyzed your content (347 questions indexed)
- We can do a small proof-of-concept quickly (1-2 weeks)
- Flexible on partnership models

Happy to be one of the options you evaluate. Let me know if a quick demo would help with your comparison.

---

### Scenario 5: They Ask Technical Questions

**Your Response:**

Great questions - here are answers:

[Answer their specific technical questions clearly and honestly]

Would it be helpful to have a brief technical call with your team? I can walk through architecture, APIs, security, scalability, etc.

Or happy to continue via email if you prefer.

---

## Red Flags to Watch For

🚩 **They keep saying "soon" but never commit** → Politely back off, check in monthly

🚩 **They ask for free work/POC without commitment** → Clarify pilot terms upfront

🚩 **They want all features but have no budget** → Discuss revenue share model

🚩 **They ghost repeatedly** → Send one final "should we pause this?" email

🚩 **They compare pricing without understanding value** → Educate on ROI first

---

## When to Walk Away Gracefully

### Walk Away If:
- They've ghosted 3+ times despite follow-ups
- They want everything custom-built for free
- They're comparing only on price, not value
- Timeline keeps extending indefinitely ("let's talk next quarter" × 3)
- They're not decision-makers and won't connect you to them

### How to Walk Away:

**Subject:** Re: ANKR - Pratham | Pausing This Conversation

Dear Ankit, Pranav,

I haven't heard back in a while, so I'm assuming this isn't a priority right now - totally understand.

I'll pause this conversation for now. If things change in future and you'd like to revisit, my door is always open.

Best of luck with your educational initiatives - Pratham is doing important work.

Best regards,
Captain Anil Sharma

## On the Call (When You Get There)

### Call Structure (20 minutes):

**Minutes 1-5: Listen**
- "Tell me about your current setup"
- "What's working? What's not?"
- "What would make the biggest difference?"

**Minutes 6-15: Show Relevant Demo**
- "Based on what you said, let me show you..."
- Demo ONLY features that solve their pain
- Pause for questions

**Minutes 16-20: Next Steps**
- "Does this address your [pain point]?"
- "What would you need to see to move forward?"
- "Would a pilot make sense?"
- Let them guide

### After the Call:

**Same Day:**
Send summary email:
- Thank them
- Recap their pain points (show you listened)
- Recap what you showed
- Confirm next steps
- No pressure

---

## Pricing Discussion (When It Comes Up)

### Pilot Pricing:
**Small Pilot (50 students, 1 month):** ₹25,000
**Standard Pilot (100 students, 2 months):** ₹50,000

Credited against Year 1 if they continue.

### Commercial Pricing:

**Option 1: Per-Student SaaS** (Recommended)
- ₹50-75 per student per month
- Pay only for active students
- Scales naturally
- No long-term commitment

**Option 2: Annual License**
- ₹6,00,000 per year (up to 5,000 students)
- Predictable budgeting
- Unlimited usage
- Best for larger scale

**Option 3: Revenue Share**
- Zero upfront
- They charge students ₹100-150/month
- We take 30%, they keep 70%
- Perfect for budget-constrained

### Pricing Psychology:
- Lead with Option 1 (most flexible)
- Mention Option 2 (makes Option 1 seem cheap)
- Offer Option 3 if budget is an issue
- Never discount just to close - maintain value

This strategy is about understanding, not pitching.
