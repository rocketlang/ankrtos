## 📚 For Students: How It Helps You

### **1. Ask Questions Anytime**

**Situation:** It's 9 PM. You're stuck on a math problem. Your teacher isn't available.

**What you do:**
```
1. Open ANKR app on phone/computer
2. Type or speak your question:
   "I don't understand what probability means"

3. Get answer in 10 seconds:
   "Probability is how likely something is to happen.

   Example: When you flip a coin
   - 2 possible outcomes: Heads or Tails
   - Chance of getting Heads = 1 out of 2 = 50%

   Try this: Flip a coin 10 times. You'll probably
   get Heads about 5 times.

   (From your textbook: Page 194)"

4. If still confused, ask more questions!
```

**Real benefit:** Never feel stuck or alone while studying.

---

### **2. Listen and Learn While Traveling**

       A fraction is when you divide something into parts.
       Like cutting a pizza into 8 slices..."

   [10-15 minutes of clear explanation]
```

**Real benefit:** Use travel time to study instead of just sitting.
