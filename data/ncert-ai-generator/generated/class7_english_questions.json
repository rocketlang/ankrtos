The 'spider's web hanging across the door' suggests the shed is unused and abandoned, adding a sense of stillness and isolation. The 'rusty hinges' that 'creak in the wind' introduce a auditory detail that evokes emptiness and perhaps a hint of suspense, as if the shed holds untold stories or secrets.

      "answer": "(i) The author establishes the emotional bond by using the simile 'loved as if it were their child', which elevates the dog from a pet to a family member. This comparison suggests deep affection, care, and parental attachment, highlighting the couple's loneliness and capacity for love despite their poverty. (ii) The event reveals that loyalty is rewarded unexpectedly and that genuine affection brings prosperity. The dog's instinctive action ('began to scratch') leads to the discovery, showing that the couple's kindness to the dog is reciprocated. The theme suggests that selfless love (treating the dog as their child) is rewarded with material wealth (gold coins), blending moral values with folktale elements. Evidence includes the dog's intuitive behavior and the couple's consistent care, which contrasts with the greedy neighbor's later actions.",

      "answer": "a) The wicked neighbour borrowed the dog out of greed and jealousy after hearing about the old couple's good fortune. This reveals his envious, selfish, and opportunistic character, as he wants to exploit the dog for personal gain without genuine care for the animal.\n\nb) The old couple reacted with gratitude and kindness - they thanked the dog repeatedly and fed him their best rice cakes, showing appreciation and reciprocity. In contrast, the wicked neighbour acted with entitlement and cruelty - he commanded the dog to find treasure and received only a dead snake as result. This highlights the theme that greed and jealousy lead to misfortune, while gratitude and kindness bring rewards. The extract shows how different human values produce different outcomes.\n\nc) One literary device used is **contrast** (or juxtaposition).
