Interactive sessions by environmental experts educated students on recycling and alternatives to single-use plastics. New recycling bins were installed across the campus.\n\nParticipation was remarkable, with over 300 students and 25 teachers actively involved. The drive collected approximately 50 kg of plastic waste, which was sent to a local recycling unit. The outcomes included heightened awareness, cleaner school premises, and a commitment to continue the practice. The event concluded with a pledge ceremony where students vowed to minimize plastic usage.",

The primary objectives were to promote environmental awareness, instill civic responsibility, and contribute to a cleaner community.\n\nThe event commenced at 8:00 AM with a briefing by our teacher-in-charge, Ms. Sharma. Over 60 students from classes 6 to 9 participated enthusiastically, divided into teams for waste segregation, sweeping, and planting saplings. Activities included collecting plastic waste, cleaning benches, and creating posters on 'Say No to Plastic.'\n\nThe drive concluded by 11:00 AM, resulting in the collection of 15 bags of recyclable waste and 5 bags of non-recyclable waste. The park's caretaker appreciated our efforts, and local residents joined in during the final hour.\n\n**Follow-up Measures:**\n1. **Monthly Park Visits:** Eco-Club will conduct monthly cleanliness checks and awareness sessions.\n2. **Waste Segregation Bins:** Propose to municipal authorities to install labeled bins in the park for effective waste management.\n\nThis initiative not only beautified the park but also reinforced the importance of community service among students.",
