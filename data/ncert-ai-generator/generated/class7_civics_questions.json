It promotes equality among citizens in the following ways: 1) Every citizen has one vote and each vote has equal value, ensuring political equality. 2) All citizens are equal before the law, regardless of their background. 3) Democratic governments work to reduce inequalities through laws and policies that protect the rights of all citizens, especially marginalized groups.",

      "answer": "The Indian Constitution, under Articles 14 to 18, guarantees equality to all citizens. However, social and economic inequalities persist due to historical discrimination, poverty, and unequal access to resources. The State Government plays a crucial role in addressing these inequalities through legislative, executive, and welfare measures.\n\nFor example, in the state of Karnataka:\n1. **Educational Equity Measures**: The Karnataka government runs the 'Vidyasiri' scheme, which provides scholarships and hostel facilities to students from SC/ST, OBC, and minority communities to ensure equal access to higher education.\n2. **Economic Empowerment**: The 'Anna Bhagya' scheme provides additional food grains at subsidized rates to below-poverty-line families, addressing nutritional inequality.\n\nAdditionally, State Governments implement central laws like the Right to Education Act (RTE), which mandates 25% reservation for economically weaker sections in private schools. They also form State Commissions for SC/ST and Women to address discrimination complaints.\n\nHowever, challenges remain in implementation due to lack of awareness, corruption, and inadequate funding. Therefore, while State Governments have taken significant steps, continuous monitoring and people's participation are essential to achieve substantive equality.",

      "answer": "While democracy provides a framework for equality, it does not automatically ensure equality. Democracy establishes political equality through universal adult franchise, where every citizen has one vote regardless of wealth, gender, or caste. However, social and economic equality require active government intervention. For example, state governments implement various schemes to promote equality: 1) Mid-day meal schemes in schools ensure nutritional equality for children from poor families, 2) Reservation policies in education and jobs address historical discrimination against marginalized communities, 3) Public distribution systems provide food grains at subsidized rates to economically weaker sections. Without such proactive measures by state governments, democracy alone cannot eliminate existing inequalities based on caste, gender, or economic status. Therefore, democracy creates opportunities for equality but requires continuous government action to make equality a reality.",

This sends a message that certain activities, interests, or careers are meant only for a particular gender, limiting children's aspirations and reinforcing societal biases.

Raising awareness about biased portrayals through campaigns like #WomenNotObjects\n2. Promoting advertisements that show women in diverse roles (e.g., women as scientists, pilots, leaders)\n3. Advocating for guidelines against sexist advertising through bodies like the Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI)\n4. Creating alternative media that showcases women's achievements beyond traditional roles\n\nExamples from India include the 'Share the Load' campaign by Ariel which challenged the stereotype that laundry is only a woman's responsibility, and the 'Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao' advertisements which promote girls' education and equal opportunities.",

In the chapter 'A Shirt in the Market', the supply chain for a cotton shirt involves: (1) Cotton farmers growing cotton, (2) Traders buying cotton and selling to ginning mills, (3) Ginning mills cleaning cotton and making bales, (4) Spinning mills making yarn, (5) Weavers making cloth, (6) Garment factories stitching shirts, (7) Wholesalers and retailers selling shirts to consumers.",

The farmer and factory workers get only a small share of the final price, while traders, factory owners, and retailers earn much more, showing inequality in the market chain.",

      "answer": "The supply chain of a cotton shirt reveals significant economic inequalities: 1) Cotton farmers receive minimal payment (often \u20b920-30 per kg) while facing high input costs and debt. 2) Weavers and garment workers in factories work long hours for low wages without job security. 3) Factory owners and exporters earn substantial profits through bulk orders. 4) Retailers in shopping malls sell the shirt at 5-10 times the production cost, maximizing their profit margin. This creates an unequal chain where those doing the most labor-intensive work earn the least.\n\nLocal governments can address these inequalities through: 1) Implementing and monitoring minimum wage laws for factory workers. 2) Providing subsidized inputs and fair price procurement for cotton farmers through agricultural markets. 3) Promoting cooperatives where farmers and workers collectively own production units, ensuring profit sharing. 4) Creating awareness about fair trade practices and consumer responsibility. 5) Regulating market spaces to prevent exploitation by middlemen. Through these democratic functions, local government can make markets more equitable and ensure that economic benefits reach all sections of society.",
