      "answer": "The introduction of British machine-made textiles in the 19th century severely impacted Indian weavers in the following ways:\n\n1. **Economic Decline**: British textiles were cheaper and produced in large quantities, flooding Indian markets. This led to a sharp decline in demand for handwoven Indian cloth, causing many weavers to lose their livelihoods and fall into debt.\n\n2. **Loss of Patronage**: Earlier, weavers received advances from Indian rulers and merchants. Under British rule, this system ended, and weavers were forced to sell their products at very low prices to Company agents, pushing them into poverty.\n\n3. **Social Distress**: Many weavers abandoned their ancestral profession and migrated to cities in search of work, often becoming agricultural labourers or working in British-owned factories under poor conditions, leading to the breakdown of traditional weaving communities.",

      "answer": "The British policies had a devastating impact on Indian industries, particularly on weavers and iron smelters. The imposition of heavy taxes and the introduction of cheap machine-made goods from Britain led to a decline in the demand for Indian textiles and iron products. Many weavers and iron smelters were forced to abandon their traditional occupations and work in British-owned factories, leading to a loss of livelihood and dignity. The British policies also led to the deindustrialization of India, as many Indian industries were unable to compete with the cheap and machine-made goods from Britain. This growth of discontent among weavers and iron smelters contributed to the outbreak of the 1857 Revolt, as many Indians saw the British as responsible for their economic misery and cultural degradation. The revolt was a culmination of various factors, including economic exploitation, cultural imperialism, and political subjugation.",

      "difficulty": "hard",

      "answer": "The introduction of British machine-made textiles in the 19th century had a devastating impact on Indian weavers and the traditional textile industry. Initially, Indian textiles like muslin and calico were in high demand globally, but British policies systematically destroyed this industry. \n\nKey impacts:\n1. **Economic ruin**: British imposed heavy duties on Indian textiles in Britain while allowing duty-free import of British cloth into India. This made Indian cloth expensive and British cloth cheap.\n2. **Loss of livelihood**: Thousands of weavers lost their traditional occupations as they couldn't compete with cheap machine-made cloth from Manchester and Lancashire.\n3. **Decline of quality**: The fine art of handloom weaving declined as weavers were forced to take up other menial jobs or work in British factories under poor conditions.\n4. **Raw material exploitation**: India was turned into a supplier of raw cotton to British mills, rather than manufacturing finished products.\n\nLong-term consequences:\n- Complete destruction of India's world-famous textile industry\n- India became a consumer of British goods rather than a producer\n- Traditional skills and knowledge were lost over generations\n- Economic dependency on Britain increased\n- Paved way for the Swadeshi movement in the 20th century as a response to this exploitation.",

      "answer": "Print culture in colonial India played a dual role\u2014it was used by the British to consolidate power, but also became a tool for Indians to challenge colonial rule. On one hand, the British introduced printing presses to publish official gazettes, laws, and pro-British newspapers to spread their ideology and administer efficiently. For example, the 'Calcutta Gazette' served as a mouthpiece of the colonial government. On the other hand, Indian reformers and nationalists used print to spread awareness, critique colonial policies, and mobilize people. Newspapers like 'Kesari' (edited by Bal Gangadhar Tilak) and 'Amrita Bazar Patrika' exposed British exploitation and promoted swadeshi. Pamphlets and books, such as those by Raja Rammohan Roy on social reforms and Dadabhai Naoroji's 'Poverty and Un-British Rule in India', provided economic critiques. This created a public sphere where nationalist ideas flourished, ultimately strengthening the freedom movement. Thus, print was a double-edged sword\u2014it aided colonial control but also fueled resistance.",

      "answer": "Print media played a transformative role in colonial India by acting as a vehicle for nationalist ideas and fostering a collective Indian identity. Firstly, newspapers like 'The Hindu' (1878), 'Kesari' (Marathi, 1881) and 'Amrita Bazar Patrika' (1868) openly criticized British policies, discussed issues of civil rights, and reported on nationalist activities, making people across regions aware of common grievances. Secondly, print helped standardize vernacular languages\u2014through novels, essays, and pamphlets\u2014which allowed ideas to reach the masses beyond the English-educated elite. For example, Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay's 'Anandamath' (1882) and its song 'Vande Mataram' became a unifying nationalist symbol. Thirdly, print created a public sphere where debates on social reform, self-rule, and cultural pride took place. Publications like 'Young India' edited by Mahatma Gandhi articulated the philosophy of non-violence and swadeshi, emotionally connecting people from different communities and regions. Finally, cartoons, posters, and nationalist literature distributed via print visually represented 'Bharat Mata' and other icons, strengthening a shared symbolic identity. Thus, print media was not merely informative\u2014it was instrumental in weaving a pan-Indian consciousness that transcended local loyalties.",
