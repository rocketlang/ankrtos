      "answer": "(a) Using the diffraction formula for first minimum: a sin \u03b8 = \u03bb, where a = 4.0 cm, \u03bb = 3.0 cm.\n    sin \u03b8 = \u03bb/a = 3.0/4.0 = 0.75\n    \u03b8 = sin\u207b\u00b9(0.75) \u2248 48.6\u00b0\n\n(b) (i) Angular width of central maximum is proportional to \u03bb/a. Since a doubles (4.0 cm \u2192 8.0 cm), angular width halves.\n    (ii) Intensity increases because more wave energy passes through the wider slit.\n\n(c) For light: \u03bb = 600 nm = 6 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2077 m, a = 4.0 cm = 0.04 m.\n    Ratio \u03bb/a \u2248 (6 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2077)/0.04 = 1.5 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2075 (extremely small).\n    Diffraction angle would be negligible (~0.00086\u00b0), so pattern is not observable.",
