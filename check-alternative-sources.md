5. **Use Existing 14 Books + Manual Download**

## Recommendation: START WITH 14 EXISTING BOOKS

We have enough to extract 2,500-3,000 exercises right now:
- Class 10: Math, Science, English
- Classes 7-12: All Mathematics
- Classes 7-10: All Science
- Classes 6,7,10: English

This covers the MOST CRITICAL content. We can add more books later.
