### ⚠️ USE WITH CARE (Internal Only)

**Competitive Analysis:**
- ⚠️ "Fermi.ai" (company name) - INTERNAL docs only
- ⚠️ Direct feature comparisons - Add CONFIDENTIAL header
- ⚠️ "vs. [Company Name]" - Mark as internal strategy

**Requirements:**
- Must add "INTERNAL DOCUMENT - CONFIDENTIAL" header
- Must add fair use disclaimer
- Must be factual and truthful
- Not for public distribution

**Example Safe Internal Doc Header:**
```markdown
# Document Title

**⚠️ INTERNAL DOCUMENT - CONFIDENTIAL**
**For Strategic Planning Only - Not for Public Distribution**

_Disclaimer: This document contains competitive analysis for internal
strategic planning. All claims are based on public information.
Brand names referenced for analysis purposes only (fair use)._
```

---

### ❌ NEVER USE (Public Marketing)

**Avoid in Public Docs:**
- ❌ "Better than [Company Name]"
- ❌ "[Company Name]-level experience"
- ❌ "As good as [Company Name]"
- ❌ "Cheaper than [Company Name]"
- ❌ Direct disparaging comparisons

**Why:** Trademark infringement, unfair competition laws, false advertising risk

---

## 🎯 Updated Positioning Statements

### For Public Marketing:

**OLD (Risky):**
> "ANKR LMS offers a Fermi.ai-level tablet experience at 1/10th the cost"

**NEW (Safe):**
> "ANKR LMS delivers premium tablet tutoring with Apple Pencil support, while also working on smartphones and desktops - making quality AI education accessible to all 250M students in India"

---

**OLD (Risky):**
> "Write with a stylus like Fermi"

**NEW (Safe):**
> "Write with a stylus (premium tablet experience)"

---

### For Internal Strategy:

**Safe Internal Comparison:**
> **CONFIDENTIAL - Internal Analysis**
>
> **vs. Leading Tablet-Only Platforms:**
> - We support phones (they're tablet-only)
> - We're affordable (they're premium)
> - We're multi-device (they're iPad-focused)
>
> _This analysis is for internal strategy only._
