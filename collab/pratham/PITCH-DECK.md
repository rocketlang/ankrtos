January 2026

## Slide 2: The Problem

# 50% of India Can't Access Quality Test Prep

| Barrier | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **English-only content** | 50%+ students from Hindi-medium excluded |
| **No 24x7 doubt solving** | Students stuck, lose momentum |
| **Expensive solutions** | ₹50K+ puts quality out of reach |
| **One-size-fits-all** | No personalization = poor outcomes |

**Result:** Tier 2/3 India underserved. Talent wasted.

---

## Slide 3: The Opportunity

# CUET Changed Everything

- **CUET now mandatory** for DU, BHU, central universities
- **3.4 million+ students** appeared in 2024
- **Regional demand exploding** - students want prep in their language
- **Digital-first generation** - but existing solutions don't serve them

**Market Size:** ₹4,000+ Cr addressable for UG test prep

---

## Slide 4: Current Landscape

# Why Existing Players Fall Short

| Player | What's Missing |
|--------|----------------|
| **Byju's** | English-only, expensive, one-way video |
| **Unacademy** | Live but scheduled, no personalization |
| **Testbook** | Test-focused, no teaching |
| **Physics Wallah** | Science-heavy, limited UG non-science |

**Gap:** No voice-first, regional language, AI-powered tutoring

---

## Slide 5: Our Solution

# Pratham Voice Saathi

**"Ask in Hindi. Learn in Hindi. Succeed in any exam."**

```
Student speaks: "Contract law mein consideration kya hota hai?"
                              ↓
AI Tutor responds: [Voice explanation in Hindi using
                   Pratham's actual course content]
                              ↓
Follow-up: "Kya aap ek example de sakte ho?"
                              ↓
AI: [Contextual example, remembers conversation]
```

**24x7 personal tutor. Any language. Instant response.**
