# Email 3: Meeting Suggestion (Only After Engagement)

**SEND THIS AFTER THEY RESPOND TO EMAIL 2 WITH INTEREST**

**To:** ankit.kapoor@iifm.co.in, pc@favcy.in
**CC:** bharat@socialkyte.com
**Subject:** Re: ANKR - Pratham | Quick Call to Align?

---

Dear Ankit, Pranav,

Thanks for those details - very helpful.

Based on your answers, I think **[Direction X]** would be the most valuable fit for Pratham, especially given **[their specific constraint/need you learned]**.

Rather than continue back-and-forth over email, would a **20-minute call** be helpful? I can:

✓ Show you a quick working example relevant to your specific use case
✓ Walk through what's technically feasible given your infrastructure
✓ Discuss potential approaches and rough timelines
✓ Answer any questions you have

**No sales pitch** - just an exploratory conversation to see if there's a practical fit.

I'm available this week:
- **Tuesday (Jan 28):** 2 PM - 5 PM
- **Wednesday (Jan 29):** 11 AM - 1 PM, 4 PM - 6 PM
- **Thursday (Jan 30):** 10 AM - 12 PM, 3 PM - 5 PM

Or let me know what works better for you, and I'll adjust.

If you'd prefer to continue via email instead, that's fine too - whatever is more convenient.

Best regards,
**Captain Anil Sharma**

## Why This Email Works

✅ **Earned the ask** - You've had 2 email exchanges already, relationship established
✅ **Specific value prop** - "Show working example relevant to YOUR use case"
✅ **Time-bounded** - 20 minutes (not "let's have a meeting")
✅ **Multiple options** - Several time slots + "or let me know"
✅ **Exit option** - "Or continue via email" (no pressure)
✅ **Consultative tone** - "Exploratory conversation" not "sales call"

## When to Send Email 3

### ✅ Send Email 3 When:
- They've answered your technical questions in Email 2
- They've expressed interest in a specific direction
- They've asked "how would this work with our setup?"
- They've said "this sounds interesting, let's explore"
- They've engaged substantively (not just "thanks, we'll think about it")

### ❌ Do NOT Send Email 3 When:
- They haven't responded to Email 2 yet
- Their response was very brief/non-committal
- They said "let us discuss internally first"
- They asked for more info before deciding
- Tone suggests they're not ready

## Customization Examples

### Example 1: They're Interested in AI Tutor

Dear Ankit, Pranav,

Thanks for confirming that late-night doubt resolution is the primary need.

Based on your setup (WhatsApp groups, 500 students, smartphone access), I think a **WhatsApp-based AI tutor** would be the most practical fit - students can ask questions right in their existing groups, no new app to download.

Rather than describe how it works over email, would a 20-minute call be useful? I can:
- Show you a live demo of students asking QA questions in Hindi
- Walk through how it would integrate with your WhatsApp groups
- Discuss setup timeline (typically 1-2 weeks for initial deployment)

I'm available [time slots]...

### Example 2: They're Budget-Conscious

Dear Ankit, Pranav,

Thanks for being upfront about budget constraints - I appreciate that.

Based on what you shared, I think a **pilot program approach** might make sense - start with 50-100 students for 1 month, validate value, then discuss scaling and pricing.

Would a brief call help? I can:
- Show you what a small pilot would look like
- Discuss low-cost deployment options
- Talk through pricing models (we have options for different budgets)

No commitment on the call - just exploring if there's a fit.

I'm available [time slots]...

### Example 3: They're Technical Team

Dear Ankit, Pranav,

Thanks for sharing your current tech stack details - helpful to know you're on [their platform].

Based on that, I think **API integration** would be the cleanest approach for your team. Rather than explain the technical architecture over email, would a call with your tech lead be useful?

I can:
- Walk through API endpoints and integration approach
- Show sample code and documentation
- Discuss deployment options (cloud vs on-premise)

Technical deep-dive, not a sales call.

I'm available [time slots]...

## On the Call - What to Do

### Before the Call (15 min prep):
1. **Review all email exchanges** - note what they said
2. **Prepare relevant demo** - focus on their use case only
3. **List their pain points** - address these specifically
4. **Have 3 questions ready** - things you still need to know

### During the Call (20 minutes):

**Part 1: Listen First (5 min)**
- "Before I show you anything, help me understand..."
- "What's the most critical challenge right now?"
- "What would success look like for you?"
- Let them talk, you listen and take notes

**Part 2: Show Relevant Demo (10 min)**
- "Based on what you just said, let me show you..."
- Demo ONLY the features that solve their pain
- Don't show everything - stay focused
- Pause for questions

**Part 3: Next Steps (5 min)**
- "Does this seem like it would address [their pain point]?"
- "What would you need to see to move forward?"
- "Would a small pilot make sense?"
- Let them guide the next step

### After the Call (Same day):
Send a summary email:
- Thank them for time
- Recap what they said
- Confirm next steps discussed
- No pressure, just documentation

---

## What NOT to Do on the Call

❌ Don't do a feature dump ("and we also have...")
❌ Don't talk about price unless they ask
❌ Don't push for immediate decision
❌ Don't talk more than they do
❌ Don't show unrelated features
❌ Don't commit to unrealistic timelines

## If They Decline the Call

**Their Response:** "Let's continue over email for now"

**Your Reply:**

No problem at all - happy to continue via email.

To move forward, the main things I'd need from you are:
1. [Specific info you need]
2. [Another specific detail]
3. [One more thing]

Once I have those, I can put together a concrete proposal with timelines and approach.

Best regards,
Captain Anil Sharma

## Timeline Expectations

**Email 1 → Email 2:** Wait for their response (2-7 days)
**Email 2 → Email 3:** Wait for their response (2-7 days)
**Email 3 → Call:** Usually scheduled within 3-5 days
**Call → Follow-up:** Same day or next day
**Follow-up → Decision:** 1-2 weeks typically

**Total timeline:** 2-4 weeks from first email to decision point

---

## Success Criteria for Email 3

**Success:** They agree to a call and schedule it
**Good:** They ask questions but want more info first
**Neutral:** They say "let us check internally"
**Not ideal:** No response or vague "maybe later"

If neutral or not ideal, don't push. Send one gentle follow-up after 5 days, then back off.

## Follow-Up After Email 3 (If No Response in 5 Days)

**Subject:** Re: ANKR - Pratham | Following up

Dear Ankit, Pranav,

Following up on my suggestion for a brief call.

I understand you're busy - no pressure. If now isn't the right time, I'm happy to reconnect in a few weeks when things are less hectic.

Alternatively, if you'd prefer to continue via email, just let me know what additional information would be helpful.

Best regards,
Captain Anil Sharma
