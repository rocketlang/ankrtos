## 🚀 New Project Planned: ANKR Knowledge Base

**Vision:** AI-powered knowledge system that learns from all ANKR code/docs

**Phases:**
1. **Documentation RAG** (2-3 days) - Semantic search over .md files
2. **Code Indexing** (4-5 days) - Index TypeScript/JavaScript across repos
3. **Code Generation** (1 week) - Generate code based on ANKR patterns
4. **LMS Integration** (1 week) - Teach coding through ANKR LMS
5. **Custom Mini-LLM** (TBD) - Train model on ANKR codebase

**Use Cases:**
- Search: "How did we implement teacher dashboard?" → Get code + docs
- Generate: "Create a new analytics dashboard" → Uses ANKR patterns
- Learn: "Explain this React component" → Interactive tutorials
- Future: Custom LLM trained on ANKR style

**Status:** 📋 Planning complete, ready to build after Fermi features
**Documentation:** `/root/ANKR-KNOWLEDGE-BASE-PROJECT-TODO.md`

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate (This Week):

**Option A: Complete Fermi Features (Recommended)**
- Build Feature #4: Handwriting Input (6 days)
- Build Feature #5: Pilot Metrics Tracking (2 days)
- Full 5/5 features ready for Monday presentation

**Option B: Start Knowledge Base (Alternative)**
- Build Phase 1: Documentation RAG (2-3 days)
- Demo semantic search at Monday meeting
- Complete Fermi features after

**Recommendation:** Complete Fermi features first (all 5), then build Knowledge Base as a proper project. This keeps focus and delivers complete value to Pratham.

### Monday (Jan 27):
- Present to Pratham Foundation
- Demo Features 1-3 (Dual Modes, Multi-Model, Teacher Dashboard)
- Show cost savings: $2,622/year for 100 students
- Discuss tech partnership model

### After Pratham Meeting:
- If positive response: Integrate features with AI Tutor
- If pilot confirmed: Seed sample data, deploy backend
- Start Knowledge Base project (3-week timeline)

---

## 💰 Business Impact

### Pratham Pilot (100 students, 2 months):

**Cost Savings:**
- Monthly: $218.50 (from multi-model backend)
- Annual: $2,622 if scaled to full year
- At 1,000 students: $26,220/year

**Competitive Position:**
- ✅ Match Fermi's pedagogy (dual modes)
- ✅ Beat Fermi's cost (₹50 vs ₹200-500/month)
- ✅ Beat Fermi's accessibility (phone vs tablet)
- ✅ Auto-misconception detection (Fermi doesn't have this)

### Knowledge Base Project (Future):

**Revenue Opportunities:**
- ANKR LMS + Code Learning: New course offerings
- Code Search SaaS: License to dev teams
- Consulting: "Build knowledge base for your codebase"
- White Label: Enterprise licensing

**Internal Value:**
- 10x faster code discovery
- Consistent code generation
- Faster onboarding for new devs
- Auto-generated documentation

## 🏗️ Technical Infrastructure

### Current Stack:
- **Frontend:** React 19, Vite, Apollo Client, Tailwind
- **Backend:** Fastify, GraphQL (Mercurius), Prisma
- **Database:** PostgreSQL + pgvector, Redis
- **AI:** Multi-model routing (GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash, Claude Sonnet)
- **Mobile:** Expo React Native

### Knowledge Base Additions (Planned):
- **Vector DB:** pgvector (already have)
- **Embeddings:** **Voyage AI (voyage-code-2)** - Primary choice ✅
  - 1536 dimensions, $0.0001 per 1k tokens
  - 23% cheaper than OpenAI, better quality for code (10/10)
  - Already configured in AI Proxy
- **Search:** Hybrid (vector + keyword)
- **Code Parser:** TypeScript Compiler API
- **Future:** Custom mini-LLM (optional Phase 5)

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### From Fermi Competitive Analysis:
1. **Pedagogy Matters:** Both explain mode AND challenge mode needed
2. **Cost Optimization Works:** Multi-model routing saves 72.8%
3. **Accessibility Wins:** Phone-first beats tablet-only (10x market)
4. **Auto-detection Differentiates:** AI-powered misconception detection is unique

### From Teacher Dashboard Build:
1. **Database Design First:** Prisma models before services = cleaner code
2. **GraphQL Schema:** Extend types, don't rebuild
3. **Component Separation:** 5 small components > 1 large dashboard
4. **Real-time Updates:** WebSocket not needed, 30-second polling sufficient

---

## 🔄 Open Questions

1. **Fermi Features Priority:** Build #4 + #5 now, or start Knowledge Base?
2. **Pratham Response:** Will they sign pilot? Need to wait for Monday.
3. **Custom LLM ROI:** Is Phase 5 worth it? Needs cost analysis.
4. **Knowledge Base Scope:** MVP first (docs only) or full system?

**Recommendation:** Finish Fermi features (2/5 remaining), then decide based on Pratham feedback.

## 🤝 Collaboration Notes

**User (Captain Anil) Vision:**
> "May be even the method of coding someday and using lms as code creator"
> "I may crunch code and repos in auto mode someday, bring code patterns and lift and shift and using as our own mini llm"

**Claude Response:** Created comprehensive Knowledge Base TODO with 5 phases, from simple doc search to custom LLM training.

**Agreement:** Finish current tasks, document everything, THEN build Knowledge Base as proper project with room to evolve beyond initial scope.
