**Date**: January 23, 2026
**Purpose**: Verify landing page statistics with real research sources

## Current Landing Page Claims vs Reality

### ❌ CLAIM 1: "96% of websites track you"
**Source Cited**: "WebTAP Study, 2024"

**REALITY**: This is **close but not exactly verified**

**Real Research**:
- **98.6% of hospital websites** have third-party tracking ([Health Affairs, 2022](https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/abs/10.1377/hlthaff.2022.01205))
- **74% of all web traffic** encounters Google trackers ([WhoTracks.Me/Ghostery](https://www.ghostery.com/whotracksme))
- Kaspersky's Do Not Track component was triggered **38.7 billion times** between July 2023-June 2024 ([Kaspersky Securelist, 2024](https://securelist.com/web-trackers-report-2023-2024/113778/))

**VERDICT**: The 96% claim is plausible but not directly sourced. Real research shows tracking ranges from 74% (all sites) to 98.6% (hospital sites).

---

### ❌ CLAIM 2: "2,000+ trackers per day"
**Source Cited**: None

**REALITY**: This is **MISLEADING and likely exaggerated**

**Real Research**:
- Average U.S. website has **23 trackers per website** ([NordVPN, Sep 2025](https://nordvpn.com/blog/nordvpn-research-website-trackers/))
- Hong Kong sites average **45.4 trackers per website** (highest globally)
- Singapore sites average **33.5 trackers per website**

**Calculation**:
- If average user visits **20-30 websites per day**
- At 23 trackers per site × 30 sites = **690 tracker encounters per day**
- At 45 trackers per site × 30 sites = **1,350 tracker encounters per day**

**VERDICT**: "2,000+ trackers per day" is an **exaggeration**. Realistic estimate: **700-1,400 tracker encounters per day** for active users.

---

### ❌ CLAIM 3: "$200 Billion Data Broker Industry"
**Source Cited**: None

**REALITY**: This is **UNDERSTATED and outdated**

**Real Research**:
- **$278 billion** in 2024 ([Grand View Research](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/data-broker-market-report))
- **$303 billion** in 2024 ([ResearchAndMarkets.com](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/data-broker-industry-analysis-report-090900272.html))
- **$323 billion** in 2024 ([Market.us](https://market.us/report/data-broker-market/))
- **$270 billion** in 2024 ([Maximize Market Research](https://www.maximizemarketresearch.com/market-report/global-data-broker-market/55670/))
- Projected to reach **$561 billion by 2029** ([Cloaked](https://www.cloaked.com/post/the-data-broker-economy-will-hit-561-b-by-2029--why-personalized-risk-reports-are-now-the-first-line-of-defense-2))
- Projected to reach **$598 billion by 2034** ([Dimension Market Research](https://dimensionmarketresearch.com/report/data-broker-market/))

**VERDICT**: $200 billion is **outdated**. The correct figure is **$278-323 billion** (2024).

---

### ❌ CLAIM 4: "Your data sold 87 times/year"
**Source Cited**: "Privacy Rights Clearinghouse"

**REALITY**: This specific number is **NOT FOUND in any research**

**Real Research**:
- Data brokers have **1,500 data points per person** ([WebFX](https://www.webfx.com/blog/internet/what-are-data-brokers-and-what-is-your-data-worth-infographic/))
- Data broker databases contain info on **500 million active consumers** worldwide
- Personal data worth **$700/year** to data brokers ([Proton, 2025](https://proton.me/blog/what-is-your-data-worth))
- Basic data sold for **$0.0005 per person** per transaction
- **NO RESEARCH** found supporting "87 times/year" claim

**VERDICT**: The "87 times/year" statistic is **FABRICATED or unverified**. There is no credible research supporting this specific number.

---

### ⚠️ CLAIM 5: "100% of AI models use web data"
**Source Cited**: "OpenAI, Anthropic ToS"

**REALITY**: This is **PARTIALLY TRUE but overstated**

**Real Research**:
- **Common Crawl** dataset (web scraping) used by GPT-3, GPT-4, LLaMA, PaLM
- OpenAI's ToS states they use "publicly available data" for training
- Anthropic's Claude trained on web data + books + conversations
- Google's Bard/Gemini uses web data extensively
- Meta's LLaMA uses Common Crawl (web scrape)

**However**:
- Some models trained only on licensed data (e.g., Bloomberg GPT on financial data)
- Some models trained on private datasets (medical AI, proprietary data)
- "100%" is technically incorrect

**VERDICT**: "Most major AI models use web data" is accurate. "100%" is an **overstatement**.
