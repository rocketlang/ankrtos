1. Thank them for responding
2. Ask 1-2 clarifying questions

2. Don't oversell or overpromise

```
Subject: Re: ANKR - Pratham | Quick nudge

Dear Ankit, Pranav,

Following up on my previous email about the Quantitative Aptitude analysis.

I know you're busy - no pressure. Even a one-liner on the primary challenge you're trying to solve would help me focus on relevant possibilities.

Happy to wait until you have a moment.

Best regards,
Captain Anil Sharma

### Scenario 5: No Response by Day 10 (Feb 3)
**Your Action:**

Subject: Re: ANKR - Pratham | Should we pause?

Dear Ankit, Pranav,

I haven't heard back, so I'm assuming this isn't a priority right now - totally understand.

I'll pause this conversation for now. If things change in the future and you'd like to revisit, my door is always open.

The analysis we did is ready whenever you need it.

Best regards,
Captain Anil Sharma
