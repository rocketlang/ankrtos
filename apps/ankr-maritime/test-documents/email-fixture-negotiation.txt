BROKER'S NOTE (Maritime Brokers Asia):
Charterers are serious and have good track record. Recommend Owners consider counter-offer carefully. Market is currently soft but firming up. Similar fixtures concluded last week at USD 17,800-18,200/day. Charterers have back-to-back COA with major shipper, so employment visibility is good.
