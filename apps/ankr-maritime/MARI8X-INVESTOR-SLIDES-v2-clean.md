## SLIDE 2: THE PROBLEM

### **Ship Brokers Are Stuck in the Stone Age**

**Current Workflow (Manual):**
```
72 minutes per vessel:
  ├─ 5 min: Find vessel on tracking platforms
  ├─ 2 min: Look up IMO number
  ├─ 30 min: Search owner (multiple databases)
  ├─ 15 min: Find company contact info
  └─ 20 min: Calculate port costs (PDFs)

Daily Capacity: 6 vessels
Monthly Revenue: $5,000
Annual Tool Costs: $12,000
```

**The Pain:**
- ❌ Multiple expensive subscriptions ($1,000+/month)
- ❌ Manual data entry & spreadsheets
- ❌ Outdated information (weeks/months old)
- ❌ Missed opportunities (can't analyze enough vessels)
- ❌ Human errors in calculations

**Market Size:** 50,000+ ship brokers worldwide losing $600M+ annually in inefficiency

---

## SLIDE 3: THE SOLUTION

### **Mari8X: From Discovery to Deal in 14 Seconds**

**Our Workflow (Automated):**
```
14 seconds per vessel:
  ├─ 0 sec: Real-time AIS map (automatic)
  ├─ 1 sec: Click vessel → IMO number
  ├─ 10 sec: Auto-fetch owner (proprietary integration)
  ├─ 2 sec: Match company database
  └─ 1 sec: Calculate port costs (800+ ports)

Daily Capacity: 300+ vessels (50x increase)
Monthly Revenue: $25,000+ (5x increase)
Annual Tool Costs: $0 (Mari8X replaces all)
```

**The Breakthrough:**
- ✅ All-in-one platform (replaces 5+ tools)
- ✅ Real-time data (seconds, not weeks)
- ✅ 100% accurate (direct from IMO)
- ✅ AI-powered matching
- ✅ Automated workflow
