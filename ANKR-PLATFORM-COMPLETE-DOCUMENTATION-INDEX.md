## 🧠 Key Technologies Explained

### **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)**

**What it is:**
A smart way to make AI answer questions from YOUR documents (not random internet).

**How it works:**
```
1. Upload textbook → Extract text
2. Break into chunks (512 words each)
3. Create "embeddings" (mathematical fingerprints)
4. Store in vector database (pgvector)
5. When student asks question:
   → Search for relevant chunks
   → Send to AI to write answer
   → Show with page numbers
```

**Why it's better than fine-tuning:**
- ✅ Cheaper (use existing AI models)
- ✅ Faster (works instantly)
- ✅ Updatable (just upload new docs)
- ✅ No ML expertise needed

---

### **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**

**What it is:**
A universal way for AI to use tools and connect to services.

**How it works:**
```
AI needs to:
- Get data from database
- Send email
- Create chart
- Export to Excel

MCP provides one standard way to do ALL of these!
```

**What we'll build:**
```
ANKR MCP Server (255+ tools):
├── Document tools (upload, extract, chunk)
├── Query tools (search, retrieve, cite)
├── Generation tools (quiz, audio, summary)
├── Analysis tools (weak areas, trends)
└── Integration tools (WhatsApp, email, export)
```

**Why it matters:**
- ✅ AI can do complex tasks automatically
- ✅ Extend with new tools easily
- ✅ Integrate with any service
- ✅ Standard protocol (not proprietary)

---

### **Knowledge Graphs**

**What they are:**
Visual maps showing how concepts connect.

**Inspired by:** NotebookLM mind maps + Obsidian graphs

**Example:**
```
      Mathematics
         /    \
    Algebra  Geometry
      /          \
Linear Eqs.   Triangles
     |             |
 Examples      Theorems
```

**Why they help:**
- ✅ Visual learners understand better
- ✅ See relationships between topics
- ✅ Navigate content visually
- ✅ Identify prerequisites

---

### **Study Packages**

**What they are:**
Complete learning materials in one click.

**Inspired by:** NotebookLM training packages

**What's included:**
1. Text summary (2-3 pages)
2. Audio lesson (15 min MP3)
3. Video links (YouTube search)
4. Mind map (interactive)
5. Practice quiz (10 questions)
6. Flashcards (15 cards)
